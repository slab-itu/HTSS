Whole-genome mutational burden analysis of three pluripotency induction methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'There is concern that the stresses of inducing pluripotency may lead to deleterious DNA mutations in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines, which would compromise their use for cell therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report comparative genomic analysis of nine isogenic iPSC lines generated using three reprogramming methods: integrating retroviral vectors, non-integrating Sendai virus and synthetic mRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used whole-genome sequencing and de novo genome mapping to identify single-nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions, and structural variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show a moderate number of variants in the iPSCs that were not evident in the parental fibroblasts, which may result from reprogramming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were only small differences in the total numbers and types of variants among different reprogramming methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, a thorough genomic analysis showed that the variants were generally benign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the process of reprogramming is unlikely to introduce variants that would make the cells inappropriate for therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cell replacement therapies using cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)) have been approved for clinical trials for macular degeneration, spinal cord injury and type-1 diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limited data available to date indicate that there are no adverse events in patients receiving these cells1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there continues to be discussion about the theoretical chance that these transplanted cells may develop into tumours or cause other pathologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discussion has come to focus on iPSCs, largely due to concerns that the massive epigenetic remodelling that occurs during reprogramming might cause genomic mutations that could make the cells tumorigenic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These concerns have led multiple groups to study the genomic integrity of iPSCs using methods that include single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping1,2, CGH3, karyotyping4 and exome sequencing5 (reviewed in refs 6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each case, the focus has been exclusively on a single type of genomic alteration, rather than considering the combined effects of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), structural variants (SVs) and copy-number variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, detailed comparative genomic analyses of iPSC lines that have been generated via distinct reprogramming methodologies have yet to be reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we assessed genome-wide mutation rates from replicate isogenic cell lines generated by three distinct methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used integrating viral (retrovirus), non-integrating viral (Sendai virus) and non-integrating non-viral (messenger RNA (mRNA)) reprogramming strategies to introduce exogenous expression of POU5F1, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC in separate fractions of a single fibroblast population (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three clonal lines were established from iPSCs generated by each method and determined to be pluripotent by standard measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect SNVs, SVs and copy-number variations within each line and the parental fibroblast population, we generated whole-genome sequencing data for each iPSC line and the parental fibroblasts at an average read depth of 39-fold, with 93.7% of the autosomal genome covered by at least 10 reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, to assess chromosomal rearrangements and large SVs with high resolution, we performed whole-genome mapping using the recently developed Irys Technology (BioNano Genomics, San Diego, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected subtle differences in the numbers of variants depending on the method, but rarely found mutations in genes that have any known association with increased cancer risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that mutations that have been reported in iPSC cultures are unlikely to be caused by their reprogramming, but instead are probably due to the well-known selective pressures that occur when hPSCs are expanded in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Experimental and computational design for identifying variants caused by reprogramming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Diagram describing the derivation of three biological replicates of each three reprogramming methods: retrovirus, Sendai virus and non-integrating mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Kernel density estimation for VAF and coverage for a constituent sample from each reprogramming method: M1 (mRNA), R1 (retrovirus) and S1 (Sendai virus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For R1 and S1, there are denser clusters near 40 × coverage and 4060% VAF than the M1 sample, which indicates they had a higher mutational load during initial doublings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it should be noted that all these samples also contained several subclonal variants that are not considered in further analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The histograms are intended to aid the readers in interpreting the results of the kernel density estimations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Flow diagram detailing the filtering strategy employed to arrive at high-confidence set of SNVs unique to each reprogrammed cell line using MuTect and HaplotypeCaller.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Identification of single-nucleotide variants', 'To characterize the mutational burden in iPSCs, we identified SNVs that were unique to each iPSC cell line by integrating results from HaplotypeCaller8 and MuTect9, as described in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For variant calling with HaplotypeCaller, we treated all 10 samples (the parent fibroblast population and three biological replicates for each reprogramming method) as part of a single population using the multisample option.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pipeline was tuned for the identification of recurrent variations in population studies, and therefore enabled us to have higher specificity in classifying reprogramming-induced mutations by accounting for mosaicism in the parental fibroblast population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain a more sensitive assessment of the SNV landscape across the iPSC samples, we also called variants using MuTect, wherein each iPSC line was compared with the parental fibroblast population in an analogous manner to which tumour samples are compared with normal tissue in oncogenomic studies (Fig 1c; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the results from these two distinct variant calling pipelines gave us higher confidence in our ability to identify true variants through the moderation of type I and type II errors, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The identified set of putative unique variants was split into three groups according to our confidence in the variant calls: Variant Set 1 was called unique by both MuTect and HaplotypeCaller; Variant Set 2 had coverage between 2060 × , and allele frequency distribution between 0.4 and 0.6 but was called only by MuTect, and Variant Set 3 comprised those with allele frequencies between 0.20.4 and 3050 × coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Variant validation by quantitative PCR from each of these three groups indicated that the mutations from Variant Set 1 had the highest likelihood of being true somatic variants (Supplementary Data 1; Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, subsequent analyses were restricted to these variants, which likely occurred during the initial doublings of the founder populations of the iPSCs compared with variants that are in lower allelic fractions that could arise as a result of proliferation of the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our filtering strategy focuses on these high-confidence variants and also removes variants that are found in low-complexity regions and dbSNP (Fig 1c; Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Identification of insertions and deletions', 'Due to the specificity of multisample HaplotypeCaller in identifying high-confidence SNVs, HaplotypeCaller was also used for identifying insertions and deletions (indels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Identification of structural variations', 'Structural variations (SVs), 10 kbp to 1 Mbp in size, are common in the human genome, but challenging to assess by sequencing alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome mapping in nanochannel arrays provides a single-molecule platform complementary to DNA sequencing for accurate genome assembly and SV analysis (Irys System, BioNano Genomics)10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unamplified genomic DNA, fluorescently labelled at a seven-base sequence motif and by the intercalating dye YOYO-1, was linearized by electrophoresis into 50-nm channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An array of approximately 12,000 nanochannels was imaged for each sample, and the process was repeated multiple times, producing data at a throughput of about 1.5 Gbp h1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only molecules 150 kbp and longer were used to create a de novo assembly of the complete genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed the fibroblast control and one iPSC line chosen at random from each of the three reprogramming methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We collected 160 Gbp (50 × ) of high-molecular-weight DNA for each sample, 500,000 single-molecule maps with the minimal length of 150 kbp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from each sample were assembled using an in-house developed de novo assembler based on Overlap-Layout-Consensus paradigm14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N50 length is the length for which the collection of genome maps of that length or greater cover  greater than 50% of the total genome length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genome maps in this study had a N50 of  greater than 0.9 Mbp, overlapping close to 90% of the Genome Reference Consortium Human genome (GRch37; Methods; Supplementary Fig 2; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Assessing pathogenicity of unique variants', 'To assess the functional consequences of the variants, the sets of high-confidence unique SNVs and indels were annotated using the SGAdviser17 and Oncotator18 program suites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were further characterized based on overlaps with ENCODE annotated genomic regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, most mutations fell within intergenic or intronic regions, with the rate of coding mutations in the range of 210 mutations per cell line (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential for variants to be oncogenic was assessed by measuring their overlap with cancer genes, transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS), MutSig genes and Familial Syndrome Cancer Genes (Methods; Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then compared the frequency of the annotated somatic mutations across the three reprogramming methods using an exhaustive permutation testing procedure and one versus all contrasts in analysis of variance (ANOVA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the iPSC lines had hundreds of variants compared with the parental fibroblasts, with the mRNA-derived lines having fewer high-confidence mutations on average than the other methods (Fig 2a; Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not find evidence that any one of the methods was more likely than the others to cause oncogenic or deleterious mutations, but we identified trends based on one versus all ANOVA contrasts that linked reprogramming strategies to certain mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell lines reprogrammed using mRNA had several variants that overlapped binding sites for a transcription factor (EZH2; enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit), although it is unknown if these would disrupt transcription factor binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The retroviral-induced cell lines harboured more potentially damaging mutations than the other methods (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the three retrovirally reprogrammed cell lines contained integrated vectors in 7, 8 and 12 sites in the genome, and while the majority of integration sites were intergenic, some integrations mapped to coding regions (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Sendai virus reprogrammed cell lines, there was a trend towards fewer coding mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we want to emphasize that based on the variance and means of the aggregated statistics, this study was not sufficiently powered to assess the differences among the different reprogramming methods for some variant classifications (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Characterization of variants caused by reprogramming method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Overall counts for the number of high-confidence SNVs and indels per sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The relative percentage of mutational subtypes for the SNVs in each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) A violin plot and box plot for the indel size distributions in the sample, a positive length indicates an insertion, whereas a negative one is a deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Variant classifications based on their relative locations in the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error bars indicate the low, median and high replicate for each reprogramming method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introns and IGR variants are plotted on a different scale.Full size image', 'Table 1 P values from the permutation-based ANOVA test for variant-type differences across the three reprogramming methods.Full size table', 'Table 2 High-confidence variants in coding regions.Full size table', 'Table 3 Functional impacts as calculated by ANOVA contrasts using a one versus all approach.Full size table', 'We also characterized the context of the mutations, as well as the overall transition/transversion rates for the different samples (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutational context analysis revealed no realizable difference among the different reprogramming methods and identified no links to known cancer-related mutational signatures19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we looked at the Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD)20 score distribution of the variants, and although we saw statistically significant differences among the three methods, the scores for all methods fell mostly within the non-deleterious range of less than 15 CADD Score (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using the variant calling algorithms for the data from de novo whole-genome mapping of four of the samples, we called 259 insertions and deletions in the parental fibroblast sample, 239 in the retroviral sample, 248 in the Sendai sample and 268 in the mRNA sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of the variants ranged from 2.8 kbp to 4.9 Mbp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a 50% reciprocal size overlap cutoff, we identified variants that were shared among the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After manual inspection to eliminate false positives and false negatives, we found no cell line-specific variants in the retroviral and Sendai samples, but one deletion in the mRNA-reprogrammed sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deletion in this line was a heterozygous 228.8-kbp deletion at Xp22.11, which removed one copy of the PHEX gene (phosphate-regulating neutral endopeptidase) and one copy of Mir_548.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This deletion is illustrated in Fig 3, which shows the assembly of part of the X chromosome for each cell line, as well as the single-molecule data supporting two haplotypes for this region in the mRNA sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subsequently looked for this deletion in the sequencing data and identified it in the same sample; it was not present in any of the other samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that this iPSC line was derived from a rare fibroblast containing the deletion or that the deletion was acquired very early in the reprogramming process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: A 228.8-kb deletion at Xp22.11 in sample M3 detected by BioNano genome mapping.Each assembly is compared with the GRCh37 reference genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black vertical marks show the position of the fluorescently labelled seven-base motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the M3 sample, observed individual DNA molecules and their labels are represented, showing the support for two haplotypes, one with the deletion at Xp22.11.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our assessment of the mutation profiles associated with three widely used reprogramming methods for generating iPSCs indicates that all of the reprogramming approaches add to the mutational load of cells, but there were subtle differences among the methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we found that the non-integrating mRNA reprogramming technique resulted in fewer total mutations than either retrovirus or Sendai virus-based reprogramming methods, mRNA-iPSCs had a greater number of mutations in binding sites for a transcription factor (EZH2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the only large structural variation (a 228.8-kbp deletion) we detected was in an mRNA-reprogrammed iPSC line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the Sendai virus samples had fewer coding mutations than the other methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results using retroviral vectors showed that this method caused a similar number of mutations as the other methods, but was slightly more likely to introduce mutations that are classified as deleterious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But the main concern with retroviral vectors is the fact that they insert into the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic insertions have a low but finite chance of disruption of active genes or regulatory regions, and can cause cancers if they activate endogenous oncogenes21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retroviral vectors were used in the first methods developed for reprogramming22 but were reported to be capable of reactivation, which resulted in tumours in mice23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of retroviral vectors for reprogramming has become less popular as delivery methods for transiently expressing the reprogramming factors without being inserted, such as the Sendai viral vectors and mRNA used here, have become more efficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the potential practical significance of our findings to clinical applications for stem cells, it is important to appreciate some of the biological context surrounding our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on the high-confidence variants that differed from the parental fibroblast population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These variants likely arose during the initial doublings of the founder population of iPSCs, but we cannot rule out their origin in a minority population in the heterogeneous parental fibroblasts that was undetectable by sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that there were sequencing reads that support several additional lower variant allele frequency mutations in the cell lines as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the cells we analysed were cultured for a relatively short time, and that variants in an early-arising small subpopulation could become more dominant over time if they give the cells a selective advantage in culture6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To move forward towards applying stem cell-based therapies for human disease, it is important to focus our efforts on improving the likelihood that there will be no adverse effects of these therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study was more extensive than previous analyses, but larger studies of this depth are still needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While results of our study do not rule out the possibility that reprogramming cells could introduce oncogenic mutations that compromise the safety of iPSCs, they should alleviate some of the concern about how likely it is that reprogramming itself would cause dangerous genomic changes that could lead to harm to transplant recipients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that genomic aberrations, some of which could be oncogenic, are known to occur during the considerable expansion of cells that is required for clinical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While development of new methods for reprogramming will make the process simpler and less expensive, it is critical at this stage that we concentrate on monitoring the appearance and potential consequences of mutations that arise during cell division and differentiation in culture and are selected for by the culture conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
