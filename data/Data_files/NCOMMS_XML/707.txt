Water striders adjust leg movement speed to optimize takeoff velocity for their morphology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Water striders are water-walking insects that can jump upwards from the water surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quick jumps allow striders to avoid sudden dangers such as predators attacks, and therefore their jumping is expected to be shaped by natural selection for optimal performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Related species with different morphological constraints could require different jumping mechanics to successfully avoid predation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that jumping striders tune their leg rotation speed to reach the maximum jumping speed that water surface allows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the leg stroke speeds of water strider species with different leg morphologies correspond to mathematically calculated morphology-specific optima that maximize vertical takeoff velocity by fully exploiting the capillary force of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results improve the understanding of correlated evolution between morphology and leg movements in small jumping insects, and provide a theoretical basis to develop biomimetic technology in semi-aquatic environments.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It is widely known that the superhydrophobic hairy legs of water striders enable them to float only on tarsi1,2, and that the striders transport the momentum via vortices and capillary waves to propel themselves across the water surface1,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But what are the mechanical characteristics of jumping off the water surface?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertical and near-vertical jumps are performed in natural habitats in a series of frequent jumps that are triggered by attacks of predators, such as fish and backswimmers (predatory insects of the genus Notonecta), from under the water surface6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it was suggested that water striders push the water surface with their legs to generate the upward capillary force on jumping3,8,9,10, the mechanics of this swift mode of locomotion have not been fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a robotic water strider was built that uses the basic principle of momentum transfer observed in one of the larger species of water striders, Aquarius paludum11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple mechanical model of interactions between A. paludum legs and the water surface has been created to aid designing the robot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But it is still uncertain whether the combinations of species-specific morphology and leg movements observed in water striders maximize the insects jumping performance as expected from natural selection for predation avoidance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon the basis of the initial kinematic calculations11 and the insights from high speed videos of jumping, we develop here a theoretical model of insect leg movements that enables the predictions of conditions for optimal jump performance in water striders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then empirically verify the optimal predictions using individuals from five water strider species of different body sizes and leg morphologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that, despite having different morphological constraints on leg dimensions, species tune their leg rotation speed to optimize the takeoff velocity from the water surface.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'General description of a water striders jumping on water', 'From high-speed videos (see Methods for details) of three species of water striders (Gerris latiabdominis, G. gracilicornis and A. paludum), we observed near vertical jumps (with trajectories steeper than 60° to the horizontal; Supplementary Video 1) in order to develop the mathematical model of the vertical component of jumping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At rest, a water strider (Fig 1a) supports its weight using all of six legs with its body centre located at yi (see list of symbols and their descriptions in Table 1) above the water surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the insect initiates a jump by pushing the surface with the middle and hind legs downwards, dimples are made (Fig 1a), which enables the insect to control its direction and speed of the jump by transferring momentum to the water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimple depth h (Fig 1b), measured from the unperturbed water surface, increases and then decreases with time t (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimple depth reaches its maximum hm at the time tm, which divides the jump into two stages: the pushing (t less_than tm) and the closing (t greater than tm) stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average downward velocity of four legs with respect to horizontal plane through insects body centre vs is bell-shaped over time (Fig 1g), and the upward velocity of the insect body v overtakes vs at the moment of reaching the maximum dimple depth, t=tm, when the vertical growth rate of the dimple (vs  v) becomes zero and its corresponding maximal depth is denoted as hm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, in the pushing stage the downward velocity of legs is larger than the upward velocity of the insect body (vs greater than v), but in the closing stage vs less_than v.', 'Figure 1: Jumping of a water strider.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A water strider (male Aquarius paludum with a body mass of 37.2 mg and an average length of middle and hind legs of 22.1 mm) that rests and jumps on water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (bd) Definitions of various lengths considered in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The vertical lengths including body centre location y, vertical distance from the tip of the legs to the horizontal plane through body centre ls and dimple depth h.

That is, if we consider an insect of a specific M (that is, an insect of specific mass m and tibia plus tarsus length lt), we expect that the longer is the femur (resulting in longer L), the slower should be the leg movements to produce the optimal jump (slower ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For insects with large mass and/or short tibia plus tarsus length lt, resulting in relatively large M (example in Fig 4c; M=2.0), the values of  that may produce the maximal takeoff speed are relatively low (in Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for a typical water strider with relatively long tibia plus tarsus lt and small mass resulting in small M (for example, M=0.5 in Fig 4b), the leg rotational speeds that may produce optimal jump are relatively large (in Fig 4b), and a water strider should be able to precisely adjust its leg rotation  to its leg length L in order to produce the optimal jump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if an insect of M=0.1 (Fig 4a) has long legs L, then its optimal leg rotation speed  should be low (red arrows in Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But, if an insect of the same M had short legs, then its optimal leg rotation would be fast (black arrows in Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insects should be careful to not go over the optimal leg rotation speed because it may result in piercing of the water surface and a sudden decrease in jump performance (notice sharp transition from yellow to blue especially for large values of L; Fig 4ac) as the leg rotation  increases (also see Supplementary Fig 5b and Supplementary Note 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Fig 4df shows that the optimal conditions maximizing takeoff velocity also minimize the time to escape from the water surface for post-takeoff closing jump, which may increase the insects survival rate (an alternative 3D graphical representation of Fig 4af shown in Supplementary Fig 6 and Supplementary Note 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, to compare the theoretical predictions with corresponding empirical data from water striders of different sizes M, we constructed a two-dimensional regime map for the three modes of jumps in the space of two dimensionless variables derived from equation (3): the leg length L and the composite variable M1/2 involving leg rotation, body mass and tibia plus tarsus length (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because variation in M1/2 expresses mostly the variation in  rather than M in real striders, the variable M1/2 mostly represents the behavioural trait , justifying our approximate view of M1/2 as a behavioural index (see Supplementary Note 8 and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical line of meniscus breaking could be simply approximated as L1M1/2 (the blue dashed line in Fig 4g) by balancing velocity of body centre v of an insect and average downward velocity of the four legs with respect to the horizontal plane through body centre vs at t=tm (for the derivation, see Supplementary Note 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red lines in Fig 4g, corresponding to the condition for the maximal takeoff velocity, are located in the area of pre-takeoff closing jump for insects with relatively short legs, that is, when the maximum downward reach of legs L3.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But, for long-legged insects, with L greater than 3.5 typical for many water strider species, the fastest jump occurs when the insect drives its legs at the speed just below the meniscus breaking condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the jumping of water striders occurs always near the condition for the maximal takeoff velocity as shown in Fig 4g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most jumps occurred just a little below the critical line of meniscus breaking (Fig 4g) as if the animals kept a certain safety margin to avoid the breaking of water surface that may dramatically decrease their chances of successful escape from predators.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The reasonable match between the model predictions and the empirical findings for the maximal takeoff speeds suggests that water striders have the ability to adjust their behaviour (angular leg movements) to reach the optimal conditions for the fastest jump away from danger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphological traits appearing in our model, that is, body mass m, tibia plus tarsus length lt, whole leg length ll and leg radius r, are not likely to have been optimally designed for only a single particular function, such as jump escape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the behavioural trait can in principle be adjusted by individuals within the animals physical abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our results, we hypothesize that a water strider of a given mass and morphology may control its stroke speed by modifying the leg rotations angular velocity to attain the maximum jumping speed as an adaptation to avoid predation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This then leads to a question of whether the hypothetical optimal adjustment of the leg movements to morphology is achieved by natural selection for a hardwired species-specific motor pattern or by individual learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model enables the pursuit of a variety of similar questions in the future because, in principle, it may be used to predict the effect of leg angular movements as well as morphological features on jump performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For simplicity, we only focused on the vertical jumping with synchronized leg locomotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In those jumps, the dimples on the water surface under mid-legs occur approximately simultaneously with the dimples under hind-legs11, justifying our simplifications for modelling purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because in our model the insect body mass is located in one point of space, the body centre, we also ignored the distinction between downward movements of tibia and tarsus due to the actual leg being pushed away from the body centre by muscles and to the rotation of the insects body axis during jump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter appears to contribute to the hind leg pushing against the water surface during the pushing stage of jump when body axis changes from horizontal to about 45o by the moment of maximal dimple depth (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite its simplicity, our model is sufficient to provide us crucial insights into water striders near-vertical jumping on water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fast upward jump is the best solution to escape predators6,7 in those situations when insects are surprised by an attack from under the water surface, while the attackers approaching movement trajectory cannot be tracked by prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actually, the water striders also may move their four legs in many different ways, showing a variety of jumping trajectories and speeds, including back somersaults and an apparent ability to control their jump trajectories with respect to the direction of the approaching danger in situations when they can perceive it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general theoretical approach in this study would be still valid for water striders upward jumping with four legs moving differently if we build complex locomotion functions to reflect the four legs motions of each case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together with Koh et al.11, our results prove that water striders are able to exploit water surface properties to optimally perform their predation avoidance jumps using elongated legs that are developmentally shaped by recently discovered genetic mechanism16, which is an apparent outcome of natural selection to avoid predator attacks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work adds to the documented or suggested repertoire of water striders behaviours that evolved to exploit the water surface properties: defence of territories17,18,19,20,21, courtship21,22,23, establishing dominance in agonistic interactions20,24, defence of mates against harassment from other males during mate guarding25, sex recognition20,21,26 and sensing distribution of food in environment27 or possibly also sensing local sex ratio in a population28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our study provides a mathematical understanding of how a biological organism may achieve the optimal level of motility on water surface by apparently tuning the behavioural trait to its morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether species-specific leg movements are innate and shaped by co-evolution with morphology, or behaviourally plastic and shaped by individual experience during jumping, remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many studies have not directly determined the role of individual learning in adjusting the locomotion behaviour to locomotory organs morphology, but they generally documented a similar match between the morphology and behaviours in a variety of mostly vertebrate taxa29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actual tuning by individuals of their locomotory behaviour to morphology has been documented in only some organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, juvenile Acrocephalus birds are able to learn from experience and adjust the use of perching sites and habitats in order to optimally tune the use of legs for perching to their legs morphology40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the water striders may also be able to adjust their leg movement to changes in physical conditions of jumping, highlighting the possibility that insects also are able to adjust their behaviour to morphology through individual locomotory learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The model opens new avenues of research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biologists can start with our model to ask questions on the evolutionary mechanisms that shape jump-optimizing morphology and behaviour of water striders with known phylogenies42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modified model can also be used to understand jumping of other insects of similar ecology, such as springtails or fishing spiders that exploit capillary force to jump from water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fundamental concepts presented in this study can also give a guideline to develop semi-aquatic robots that aim to emulate the superior locomotory abilities of the water striders on water45,46,47.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Experimental setup', 'For slow motion filming we used three Asian species (G. latiabdominis, G. gracilicornis and A. paludum from streams and ponds around the Seoul National University, and from ponds in Yongsan area, Seoul, Korea), and two North American species (G. remigis, G. comatus from the Huyck Preserve, NY, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insects were filmed in the lab using artificial lighting (Korean species) or in the outdoors using sunlight (North American species).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A water strider was induced to jump in a square acrylic bath (70 mm wide) half-filled with water, and two high-speed cameras (Trouble Shooter 1000 ME; Fastec Imaging Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used to record the jumping behaviours at 500 or 1,000 frames per second from the front and side views simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 39 jumps by 30 adult water striders and three jumps by two nymph water striders (morphology described in Supplementary Table 1) were recorded and analysed, where the inclinations of jump trajectory were between 60° and 80° to the horizontal with almost bilateral symmetry with respect to the leg of distortion of the water surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the jumps were stimulated by a rigid stick positioned below the water striders body, and we only analysed the jumps verified that the insects body or the leg was not pushed upwards by the stick.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fresh body mass of an insect was measured right after filming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each animal was also photographed (a ruler was present in each photo to provide the scale) and the lengths of leg segments were measured from the photographs using ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animals used in the present study were handled in accordance with institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Korean law does not require special permits for the use of water striders in research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Huyck Preserve permitted us to use the water striders on their private land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Model', 'Matlab was used to obtain the results described in Fig 4, Supplementary Figs 5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To solve equation (3), ode15s function was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Code availability', 'The code is available from authors on request.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'All relevant data are available from authors on request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
