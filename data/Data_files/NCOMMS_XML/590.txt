Mitochondrial function controls intestinal epithelial stemness and proliferation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Control of intestinal epithelial stemness is crucial for tissue homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disturbances in epithelial function are implicated in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that mitochondrial function plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal stemness and homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific mouse models, we show that loss of HSP60, a mitochondrial chaperone, activates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (MT-UPR) and results in mitochondrial dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HSP60-deficient crypts display loss of stemness and cell proliferation, accompanied by epithelial release of WNT10A and RSPO1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sporadic failure of Cre-mediated Hsp60 deletion gives rise to hyperproliferative crypt foci originating from OLFM4+ stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects are independent of the MT-UPR-associated transcription factor CHOP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, compensatory hyperproliferation of HSP60+ escaper stem cells suggests paracrine release of WNT-related factors from HSP60-deficient, functionally impaired IEC to be pivotal in the control of the proliferative capacity of the stem cell niche.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) layer constitutes a rapidly self-renewing interface in intimate contact with the enteral environment and the immune system of the host, enabling intestinal homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disturbances of this homeostasis can give rise to chronic degenerative diseases of the gastrointestinal tract such as colorectal cancer (CRC) or inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide association studies on  greater than 25,000 IBD patients comprising Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) identified  greater than 200 susceptibility loci associated with IBD2,3 and about 20 loci associated with CRC4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the so far investigated genes affect the functions of the intestinal epithelium5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Epithelial crypts are the sites where epithelial cells differentiate from pluripotent stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After several cycles of proliferation in the transit amplifying zone, stem-cell-derived progenitor cells differentiate into absorptive enterocytes or into cells of the secretory lineage (goblet, enteroendocrine and tuft cells)7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, Paneth cells directly descend from stem cells and remain within the crypt to fulfil their role in antimicrobial defence and stem cell maintenance8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defects in epithelial cell homeostasis affecting antimicrobial defence, barrier permeability and IEC-immune cell interaction are crucial features of disease pathogenesis of IBD5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic inflammation is a major risk factor for the development of CRC, largely accounting for the increased risk seen in IBD patients10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically for CRC many of the so far identified loci have been associated with the regulation of proliferation4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To maintain homeostasis and IEC functionality on a cellular level, the abundance and capacity of organelles need to be tightly regulated and adapted to the actual cellular demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One critical process that limits organelle and cellular function is the availability of properly folded and functional proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfolded protein responses (UPR) are autoregulatory mechanisms that evolved in the cytoplasm, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria to ensure adaptation to fluctuating cellular demands of proteins upon environmental triggers and/or host-derived signals11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triggers affecting protein homeostasis comprise infections, oxidative stress and metabolic alterations14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UPR of the ER is particularly important for Paneth and Goblet cell function, since these cells are specialized in the production and secretion of proteins assembled in the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We and others provided evidence that a deregulated ER-UPR in IEC is indeed relevant for the pathogenesis in human IBD16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, recent studies revealed that an activated ER-UPR in crypt base columnar cells via stem cell-specific depletion of the ER chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) antagonizes stem cell properties and proliferation19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides in the ER, UPR mechanisms also evolved in mitochondria (MT-UPR), and an adequate amount of properly folded and functional proteins is essential for their fundamental metabolic functions (for example, oxidative phosphorylation and beta oxidation)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, Mohrin et al.21 showed that a Sirtuin 7-mediated branch of the MT-UPR couples cellular energy metabolism and proliferation in hematopoietic stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ER-UPR and MT-UPR signalling share certain features such as activation of the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and consistently, epithelial mitochondrial dysfunction and failure in cellular oxidative metabolism have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD22 and CRC6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Studies in yeast from the late 1980s attribute an essential role to heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) in mitochondrial protein homeostasis23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations in the HSPD1 gene encoding HSP60 were discovered to cause hereditary spastic paraplegia in humans, a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by mitochondrial dysfunction25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, constitutive HSP60 deficiency antagonizes cell viability in yeast28 and leads to embryonic lethality in mice29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated increased HSP60 expression and activated MT-UPR signalling in the epithelium of IBD patients as well as murine models of colitis and proposed a link between ER- and MT-UPR through the cytoplasmic kinase PKR30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MT-UPR in mammals is rather poorly described, but mechanistic studies in a primate-derived cell line identified the transcription factor CHOP and its cofactor C/EBP to induce expression of MT-UPR responsive chaperones like HSP60, its co-chaperone HSP10 and proteases like ATP-dependent caseinolytic peptidase proteolytic subunit homologue (CLPP)31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using an epithelial-specific Chop transgenic mouse model, we recently showed delayed epithelial proliferation and intestinal wound healing in response to increased levels of CHOP, suggesting CHOP to affect intestinal homeostasis by attenuating cell cycle progression34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate the role of the mitochondrial chaperone HSP60 in the regulation of epithelial cell homeostasis in the intestine, we generated epithelial-specific knockout mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study we show that HSP60 deficiency leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and antagonizes epithelial stem cell homeostasis through CHOP-independent mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mitochondrial dysfunction was associated with paracrine release of WNT-related signals and hyperproliferation of residual stem cells that have escaped Hsp60 deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conclusively, these data indicate a fundamental role of mitochondrial function in the control of the epithelial stem cell niche.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Epithelial Hsp60 deficiency impacts IEC proliferation', 'To investigate the role of HSP60 in IEC homeostasis, we generated conditional knockout mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exons 48 covering main parts of the ATPase domain were flanked with loxP sites via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue-specific deletion of the conditional knockout allele (Hsp60flox/flox) was achieved by breeding mice to different Cre recombinase expressing mice (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crossing of Hsp60flox/flox mice with VillinCre transgenic mice caused embryonic lethality due to general developmental retardation shortly after the onset of Villin expression (Supplementary Fig 1)35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To circumvent this problem we used tamoxifen-inducible VillinCreERT2-Tg mice to generate an epithelial-specific Hsp60 knockout in adult mice (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to severe wasting mice fulfilled abortion criteria and were killed 2 days after the end of tamoxifen administration (d2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histopathological evaluation of intestinal tissue sections in Hsp60/IEC mice revealed numerous hyperproliferative crypt foci forming nodular structures with decreasing abundance from the duodenum to the colon (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemical stainings confirmed the loss of epithelial HSP60 protein expression in most intestinal tissue areas (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, hyperproliferative crypt nodules displayed strong expression of HSP60 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laser-dissection microscopy was used to isolate genomic DNA from the epithelium of HSP60-positive, hyperproliferative crypt nodules and HSP60-negative villus tips of jejunal tissue sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, and in contrast to the villus tip, Hsp60 knockout alleles were absent in IEC from hyperproliferative crypt nodules, indicating the presence of escaper regions for genomic recombination (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HSP60 deficiency and the consequential disturbances in epithelial morphology were associated with low levels of inflammatory tissue activation, including moderately elevated numbers of F4/80-positive macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, expression levels of selected cytokines and chemokines showed no clear inflammatory pattern (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 1: Formation of hyperproliferative

deficiency (Supplementary Fig 3A), suggesting altered mitochondrial functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Loss of HSP60 activates MT-UPR independently of CHOP', 'To characterize the impact of HSP60 deficiency on UPR activation in the epithelium, we differentially isolated jejunal IEC along the villuscrypt axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated IEC from the villus tip compartment were characterized by a high degree of HSP60 deficiency, whereas the crypt bottom combined HSP60-deficient areas and HSP60-positive hyperproliferative crypt foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In IEC from villus tip and crypt bottom, expression of the co-chaperone Hsp10 and the transcription factor Chop, two surrogate markers of MT-UPR, highly correlated with Hsp60 deficiency, confirming the presence of activated MT-UPR in both compartments (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since CHOP is involved in the induction of apoptotic processes36,37, we performed a TUNEL assay to investigate whether the induction of Chop expression seen in Hsp60/IEC led to increased apoptosis of IEC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the lack of TUNEL-positive epithelial cells clearly indicated the absence of pro-apoptotic mechanisms in the entire epithelium including highly Chop-expressing villi IEC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Supplementary Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test whether the presence of HSP60-positive hyperproliferative crypt foci might be due to CHOP-mediated signals of the surrounding HSP60-deficient epithelium, we next generated Chop/ Hsp60/IEC mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the lack of CHOP did not interfere with formation and extent of HSP60-positive hyperproliferative crypt nodules (Fig 2ac; Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the absence of severe wasting in Chop/ Hsp60/IEC mice allowed for tissue analysis beyond time point d2, demonstrating complete tissue reconstitution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither hyperproliferative crypt foci forming nodular structures nor increased expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 were detectable 12 days after the end of tamoxifen administration (d12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Already by d8, HSP60-deficient crypts were completely resorbed with the total number of (HSP60-positive) crypts per centimetre again reaching control levels (Supplementary Fig 5A,B), indicating formation of hyperproliferative crypt nodules to be an essential step in epithelial reconstitution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis of MT-UPR-associated gene expression indicated activated MT-UPR signalling in villus tip as well as crypt bottom IEC from both Hsp60/IEC and Chop/ Hsp60/IEC mice, with only minor differences between the animal models (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, presence of hyperproliferative crypt foci and MT-UPR activation in response to epithelial HSP60 loss seemed to be independent of the MT-UPR-associated transcription factor CHOP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 2: Formation of hyperproliferative crypt nodules and MT-UPR activation is independent of CHOP-mediated signalling.

exceeds the demand to maintain epithelial stemness, therefore, not constituting the limiting factor of growth under non-stressed conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the combined effect of the two most prominently regulated WNT-associated factors, RSPO1 and WNT10A, we decreased the concentration of RSPO1 in the culture medium to 3% (30 ng ml1) of the optimal concentration after induction of Hsp60

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In previous studies with IBD patients, we and others demonstrated the presence and clinical relevance of activated ER UPR pathways in IEC16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we demonstrated the organelle-specific induction of chaperones including GRP78 and HSP60 in the epithelium of IBD patients and mouse models of colitis30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the mitochondrial chaperone HSP60 in the regulation of epithelial cell homeostasis by the use of conditional knockout mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Epithelial-specific HSP60 deficiency-induced MT-UPR activation in the absence of inflammation-related tissue pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, HSP60 deficiency caused mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by impaired proliferation of the intestinal epithelium and loss of stemness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that an inadequate cellular energy supply due to mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired ATP production might antagonize proliferation of stem and progenitor cells in the crypt compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-proliferative effects of HSP60 deficiency have been shown in the kidney cell line HEK293 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42), however, the underlying mechanisms and relevance have not yet been resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected the UPR-related transcription factor CHOP to be involved, since CHOP has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we generated epithelial-specific Chop transgenic mice and demonstrated that high levels of CHOP attenuate cell cycle progression leading to delayed epithelial proliferation and wound closure in response to colonic injuries34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, using Chop/ Hsp60/IEC mice in this study did not indicate any impact of CHOP-mediated signals on mitochondrial dysfunction-associated loss of proliferation and stemness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, CHOP-mediated target functions are most likely cell-context dependent, including differences in the phosphorylation status of the protein and/or the availability of binding partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, HSP60 deficiency reduced the numbers of Olfm4- and Lgr5-positive stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is remarkable and might point towards a fundamental role of organelle-specific stress regulation, since the same phenomenon has been reported for the stem-cell-specific deletion of the ER chaperone Grp78.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the latter study chaperone deficiency caused a loss of stemness involving the PERK-eIF2-CHOP branch of the ER-UPR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors concluded that UPR signalling plays an important role in the regulation of intestinal epithelial stem cell differentiation19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another study, hypomorphic function of the ER-UPR transcription factor Xbox binding protein 1 (XBP-1) led to an expansion of the Olfm4- and Lrg5-positive stem cell zone, suggesting that the IRE1-XBP-1 branch of the ER-UPR contributes to proliferative control44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of mitochondrial chaperone deficiency, organelle dysfunction and loss of stemness seem independent of CHOP-mediated signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line, the MT-UPR mediated regulation of hematopoietic stem cell aging was dependent on the interplay of the histone deacetylase sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) and the transcription factor Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF1)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HSP60 deficiency in the tamoxifen induced VillinCreERT2-Tg driven model is not complete due to sporadic failure of Cre-mediated Hsp60 deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance of escaper cells in the crypt bottom is a feature of VillinCreERT2-Tg mice and has been reported before45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HSP60-positive crypt foci are characterized by an accumulation of Ki67- and OLFM4-positive cells, suggesting that escaper stem cells in the crypt compartment hyperproliferate in response to changes in the epithelial microenvironment deficient in HSP60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, stem and progenitor cell homeostasis is a tightly regulated process involving growth promoting factors released by Paneth cells as well as the surrounding mesenchyme46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paneth cell factors that have been described to constitute a niche for stem cell proliferation are WNT3, WNT6, WNT9B and RSPO1 (refs 47, 48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mediators are complemented by mesenchymal factors like WNT2B, WNT4 and WNT5A (refs 47, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the significance of epithelial versus mesenchymal contributions is still a matter of debate40,51,52,53 and most probably, a tight interplay between growth-regulating factors originating from different cell types of the intestine occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our setup, we cannot exclude the possibility that IEC are not the sole source of enhanced production of WNT-associated factors, in particular RSPO1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts might contribute to the hyperproliferative microenvironment induced by the loss of HSP60, and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction, in IEC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our data indicate profound changes in the expression of WNT-related factors including RSPO1 in functionally impaired IEC and changes in the surrounding tissue are most likely a consequence of IEC-derived signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Disturbed cryptal homeostasis and the appearance of stem cell hyperproliferation have been reported in literature for two distinct circumstances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, aberrant growth signalling in the stem cells themselves leads to uncontrolled proliferation as seen in the APCmin (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  54) or the Rspo1 transgenic mouse model55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, as demonstrated in irradiation-mediated epithelial eradication, stem cell hyperproliferation occurs in response to epithelial damage, aiming to reconstitute tissue morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Few surviving stem cells build up new crypts by proliferative expansion before differentiation limits stem cells back to the crypt bottom56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knockout of essential epithelial genes can be considered as a comparable condition, since the escaper cells are surrounded by compromised cells, which provide the escapers with a proliferative advantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples for this phenomenon are the epithelial-specific deletion of the stem cell marker Ascl-2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  57), the transcriptional activator c-Myc (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58) and the -Catenin binding partner TCF4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, the proliferative response of escaper cells aims to restore homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the Hsp60/IEC mouse model, we suggest a paracrine mechanism by which the compromised crypt epithelium sets up a microenvironment that triggers hyperproliferation of escaper stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified WNT10A as a new relevant factor in the control of the proliferative capacity of IEC that is highly induced in HSP60-deficient Paneth cells and was able to promote growth of intestinal organoids suffering from mitochondrial dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, mitochondrial dysfunction induced by HSP60 loss antagonized intestinal stem cell homeostasis through CHOP-independent signalling mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HSP60 deficiency in IEC triggered the paracrine release of WNT-related signals associated with hyperproliferation of residual stem cells that escaped Hsp60 deletion, demonstrating a fundamental role of mitochondrial function in the control of intestinal stem cell homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cases where this homeostasis is constantly challenged, such as under conditions of chronic inflammation, this mechanism might contribute to intestinal tumorigenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
