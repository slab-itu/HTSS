Native characterization of nucleic acid motif thermodynamics via non-covalent catalysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DNA hybridization thermodynamics is critical for accurate design of oligonucleotides for biotechnology and nanotechnology applications, but parameters currently in use are inaccurately extrapolated based on limited quantitative understanding of thermal behaviours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present a method to measure the G° of DNA motifs at temperatures and buffer conditions of interest, with significantly better accuracy (6- to 14-fold lower s.e.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  than prior methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equilibrium constant of a reaction with thermodynamics closely approximating that of a desired motif is numerically calculated from directly observed reactant and product equilibrium concentrations; a DNA catalyst is designed to accelerate equilibration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the G° of terminal fluorophores, single-nucleotide dangles and multinucleotide dangles, in temperatures ranging from 10 to 45 °C.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Nucleic acid biotechnology uses engineered oligonucleotides as therapeutic agents (for example, micro RNAs)1,2,3,4,5,6 and diagnostics reagents (for example, PCR primers and next generation sequencing capture probes)7,8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nucleic acid nanotechnology uses engineered oligonucleotides as building blocks for constructing precisely patterned structures13,14,15,16,17 and complex spatio-temporal circuits18,19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both fields, accurate rational design of oligonucleotides with intended thermodynamics properties is critical to achieving desired system function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Errors in predicted G° or melting temperature values result in undesirable non-specific interactions or unpredictable aggregation/assembly pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the best DNA design and folding software exhibit errors in predicted melting temperature of 1.5 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23), corresponding to errors of roughly 3 kcal mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that there is significant inaccuracy even in common motifs such as DNA base stacks and dangles, an observation confirmed by chemical probing of nucleic acid folding structures24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Current thermodynamic parameters are extrapolated from experiments in very different temperatures and buffer conditions than typically used (for example, melt curves in 1 M Na+; (refs 25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, thermodynamics parameters for individual motifs need to be inferred through linear algebra decomposition or principal component analysis, because each melt curve provides the aggregate H° and S° of many motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large numbers of experiments on different sequences statistically mitigate the latter source of unbiased error, but the former results in systematic errors that cannot be reduced via melt curve experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we present a generalized method for measuring G° values of individual DNA motifs in native conditions of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reaction is designed with G° equivalent to the G° of the motif of interest, and the equilibrium concentrations of the reactant and product species are measured to numerically calculate the equilibrium constant Keq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The innovation that enables this approach is a DNA catalyst system that accelerates forward and reverse rate constants by orders of magnitude, allowing rapid equilibration27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We believe our native catalysis method can be used to provide an updated database of nucleic acid thermodynamic parameters for more accurate prediction and design software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have started this process by providing G° values for (1) 80 terminal fluorophore parameters, (2) 160 single-nucleotide dangle parameters and (3) 140 multinucleotide dangle parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through the course of our studies, we discovered that multinucleotide dangles destabilize nearby DNA duplexes, asymptoting at +0.56 kcal mol1 above a single-nucleotide dangle for dangles 8 nt or longer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Nucleic acid motif thermodynamics', 'The standard model of nucleic acid hybridization thermodynamics25,26 is a local model, in which the structure of a nucleic acid molecule or complex is dissected into a number of non-overlapping motifs, such as base stacks, bulges and dangles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standard free energy of formation of a molecule is calculated as the sum of its component motifs (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the past 30 years, the thermodynamics of many DNA and RNA motifs have been characterized29,30,31,32 to inform bioinformatics software for nucleic acid structure prediction33,34,35,36 and probe37,38,39 or primer40,41 or nanostructure15,42 design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, inaccuracies in the G° of DNA motifs are compounded in the overall G° of hybridization, and lead to errors in predicted hybridization affinities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: DNA hybridization thermodynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The standard model of nucleic acid hybridization decomposes any nucleic acid molecule into a number of non-overlapping motifs (for example, dangles and stacks), and predicts the standard free energy of formation of the molecule to be the sum of the G° of the individual motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traditionally, motif G° values are characterized using melt curves, and then extrapolated to other temperatures and buffer conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) In principle, motif G° can be measured in native isothermal conditions by observing the equilibrium concentrations of an appropriately designed  strand displacement reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the shown reaction characterizes the G° of the 5-T dangle next to a closing GC base pair; the partially double-stranded product differs from the partially double-stranded reactant by only the motif of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By designing the single-stranded reactants to possess negligible secondary structure, the reaction standard free energy  will closely approximate the dangle standard free energy .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) A non-covalent strand displacement catalyst C can be designed to accelerate reaction equilibration to complete within minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reverse reaction pathway is analogous to the forward reaction pathway shown here, and is also accelerated by the catalyst.Full size image', 'Traditionally, motif thermodynamics (standard free energy of formation G°) are characterized through melt curve analysis experiments43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These methods suffer from two major sources of inaccuracy: (1) yield and G° measurement are inaccurate except near the melting temperature, and (2) linear algebra decomposition of motif thermodynamics reduces accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although recently melt curve analysis accuracy has been improved through the development of high-resolution melt (HRM; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45), these limitations still exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Supplementary Note 1 for further discussion on melt curve inference of G°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other methods, such as isothermal titration calorimetry46, can be potentially used to provide higher resolution thermodynamic data, but are rarely used in practice because of the high nucleic acid concentration requirements necessitated by the small absolute values of H°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Reaction construction', 'Our method starts with the construction of a reaction whose reaction standard free energy  closely approximates the motif standard free energy  (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is achieved by designing a duplex product bearing the motif of interest (XZ) and a duplex reactant differing from the duplex product by only the motif (YZ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To balance the reaction, a single-stranded reactant oligonucleotide (X), which is part of the duplex product but not the duplex reactant, is added to the left side of the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, a single-stranded product oligonucleotide (Y) is added to the right side of the reaction.

the latter is approximately true is to design the sequences of X and Y to avoid any predicted secondary structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The value of  can be numerically computed from the observed equilibrium concentrations of the species:', '', '', 'Here R is the universal gas constant (or Boltzmann constant), and  denotes the temperature in Kelvin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the initial concentrations X0, Y0, XZ0, and YZ0, all four equilibrium concentrations can be computed from any one equilibrium concentration based on simple algebra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we can accurately determine  using an accurate measure of the equilibrium concentration of any one of the four species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Non-covalent catalysis', 'The above reaction, by itself, equilibrates slowly with a second order rate constant of roughly 1 M1 s1 (refs 28, 47, 48), corresponding to a half-life of roughly 100 days at 100 nM concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not practical to wait so long for the reaction to naturally reach equilibrium because nucleotide oxidation (for example, adenine to inosine) occurs on a similar time scale49,50, and will bias the inferred thermodynamic results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accelerate equilibration kinetics, we design a non-covalent strand displacement catalyst C, first introduced in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1c shows the catalysis reaction mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C first binds to the single-stranded portion of Z in YZ, known as a toehold, and then displaces Y one nucleotide at a time through an unbiased random walk process known as branch migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the elementary single-base replacement steps in branch migration are very fast (10100 s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51)), the entire displacement process occurs with a first order rate constant of about 1 s1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the reaction is typically rate limited by the second order toehold binding process, and is similar to hybridization kinetics for sufficiently long toeholds28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When all nucleotides in C are base paired to their complementary nucleotides in Z, Y can spontaneously dissociate, leaving intermediate CZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, CZ can react with either X or Y in a similar manner as YZ initially reacted with C, releasing C to catalyse other reactions (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, catalyst C enables a rapid pathway for both the forward and the reverse reactions of  without changing the reactions equilibrium constant (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent PAGE shows very low background and high linearity (Supplementary Figs 58, Supplementary Note 4), allowing us to map band intensity to species concentration via a simple scaling constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also allows us to verify that the catalytic mechanism is functioning as intended, and that no long-lived side products or intermediates are being formed (such as CXZ or CYZ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first study the effects of terminal fluorophores on stabilizing DNA duplexes, both because these interactions have been relatively poorly characterized52,53 and because these are necessary prerequisites for our studies of other motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose to focus our fluorophore studies on the carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX) and Alexa532 fluorophores, because

same regardless of whether it is calculated from X or XZ, but in practice slight pipetting errors in the total amount of sample loaded per gel lane will lead to different values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar argument applies to YZ inference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We correct for these in our mathematical analysis and calculation of Keq and G° from gel band intensities (Supplementary Figs 16 and 21).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this manuscript, we applied a well-characterized dynamic DNA nanotechnology circuit, the non-covalent catalyst, to the problem of DNA motif thermodynamics characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One particular qualitative difference in our motif thermodynamics characterization method is the fact that G° values of individual motifs are measured isothermally in native temperature and buffer conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially desirable for DNA biotechnology and nanotechnology applications because DNA thermodynamics in buffers needed for enzymatic amplification and self-assembly are often extrapolated from experiments at other conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using our method, we characterized the G° contributions of (1) the ROX and Alexa532 fluorophores next to duplexes, (2) single-nucleotide dangles, and (3) multinucleotide dangles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measured parameters possessed high precision due to multiple-independent repeats of each experiment; we typically achieved a mean s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of  less_than 0.1 kcal mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all dangle parameters, we used ROX- and Alexa532-labelled strands to independently produce two sets of mean G° values for internal consistency verification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our measurements of fluorophore thermodynamics may possess systematic error of up to 0.2 kcal mol1 due to the presence of intermediate CZ, but our measurements of dangles cancels out this bias through subtracting two G° values, so dangle G° values should have no systematic bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are four sources of unbiased errors in our experiments: pipetting errors, temperature errors, gel band quantitation errors and synthesis errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All but the last should be independent from experiment to experiment, so repeat experiments will tend to reduce the errors in the mean values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The single-nucleotide dangle parameters are the only parameters in our studies that have corresponding literature reported values, and there is significant disagreement between our consensus values and literature values59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Common sources of error between our approach and previous melt curve approaches include oligonucleotide synthesis impurities and concentration errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because DNA oligonucleotide synthesis have advanced significantly over the past 20 years, we believe that our results based on oligonucleotides synthesized by modern optimized techniques is more representative of true thermodynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calibrate the effects of oligonucleotide synthesis errors, we performed the same experiments on a set of independently ordered strands; the G° values measured using different synthesis preps agreed with each other to within 0.09 kcal mol1, on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we believe that literature reported extinction coefficients67 are inaccurate at the 10% level, so that previous studies relying on absorbance at 260 nm for quantitating DNA concentration likely have a larger concentration error than our stoichiometric gel characterization protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our measurements directly interrogate the motif of interest rather than rely on linear algebra decomposition, and we cross-confirmed our G° across two independent sets of fluorophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all these reasons, we believe our values to be more accurate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To the extent that there may be differences in the true values of the dangle G°, such differences may reflect a limitation of nearest neighbour model itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more complex model considering distal base identities to holistically evaluate nucleic acid structure stability may be warranted, but would also require significantly more experiments on multiple core sequence instances of the DNA motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'From simple biophysics, we postulated that multinucleotide dangles should contribute an increasing destabilizing thermodynamic effect, towards an asymptotic limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed this hypothesis experimentally, and discovered that the saturation length is roughly 8 nt, with G° roughly 0.56 kcal mol1 more positive than a single-nucleotide dangle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that dangle length should be part of the standard model for DNA hybridization and folding software, and that the table in Fig 5d be used as an empirical formula for estimating multinucleotide dangle G° values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we currently do not have a quantitative biophysical model that predicts our measured multinucleotide dangle thermodynamic parameters, and encourage interested parties to explore area of research, for example using molecular dynamics simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Performing PAGE is more labour-intensive than running a melt curve, and this is a disadvantage of our overall workflow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our approach generated motif G° parameters with s.d.s 6- to 14-fold lower than those obtained from HRM experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistically, 36- to 196-fold more experimental repeats of HRM would be needed to generate parameters of the same precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, PAGE experiments could potentially be automated, and other readout mechanisms may be possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possible approaches for downstream readout include liquid chromatography and/or microfluidics approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scaling the presented method will be vital in obtaining high accuracy G° parameters for a variety of motifs in a variety of temperatures and buffer conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, many artificial nucleotides with desirable properties, such as 2-O-methyl RNA68, locked nucleic acids69 and peptide nucleic acids70,71, lack characterization beyond rudimentary rule-of-thumb melting temperature effects from base stacks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Establishment of an accurate and comprehensive nucleic acid motif thermodynamics database will help usher a new paradigm of knowledge-driven design of nucleic acid biotechnology and nanotechnology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
