Epidemiological and economic impact of pandemic influenza in Chicago: Priorities for vaccine interventions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study objective is to estimate the epidemiological and economic impact of vaccine interventions during influenza pandemics in Chicago, and assist in vaccine intervention priorities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scenarios of delay in vaccine introduction with limited vaccine efficacy and limited supplies are not unlikely in future influenza pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulated influenza pandemics in Chicago using agent-based transmission dynamic modeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Population was distributed among high-risk and non-high risk among 019, 2064 and 65+ years subpopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different attack rate scenarios for catastrophic (30.15%), strong (21.96%), and moderate (11.73%) influenza pandemics were compared against vaccine intervention scenarios, at 40% coverage, 40% efficacy, and unit cost of $28.62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensitivity analysis for vaccine compliance, vaccine efficacy and vaccine start date was also conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vaccine prioritization criteria include risk of death, total deaths, net benefits, and return on investment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The risk of death is the highest among the high-risk 65+ years subpopulation in the catastrophic influenza pandemic, and highest among the high-risk 019 years subpopulation in the strong and moderate influenza pandemics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of total deaths and net benefits are the highest among the high-risk 2064 years subpopulation in the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The return on investment is the highest in the high-risk 019 years subpopulation in the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on risk of death and return on investment, high-risk groups of the three age group subpopulations can be prioritized for vaccination, and the vaccine interventions are cost saving for all age and risk groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The attack rates among the children are higher than among the adults and seniors in the catastrophic, strong, and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios, due to their larger social contact network and homophilous interactions in school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on return on investment and higher attack rates among children, we recommend prioritizing children (019 years) and seniors (65+ years) after high-risk groups for influenza vaccination during times of limited vaccine supplies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on risk of death, we recommend prioritizing seniors (65+ years) after high-risk groups for influenza vaccination during times of limited vaccine supplies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study objective is to estimate the epidemiological and economic impact of vaccine interventions during an influenza pandemic in Chicago, to assist in vaccine intervention priorities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Population dynamics play an important role in influenza pandemic planning and response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To optimally allocate limited vaccine resources, it is important to inform decision makers and public health officials about both the direct benefit among vaccinated population and the indirect benefit among non-vaccinated population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study adds to the evidence of prior studies by using a detailed agent-based model for estimating the direct and indirect benefits of epidemiological and economic impact of vaccine-based interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study can be extended to analyze for a range of vaccine compliance and efficacy values at different attack rates of influenza pandemics in different rural and urban areas of the United States and at the country level, to infer objective prioritization criteria for influenza vaccine interventions among different risk and age groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends seasonal influenza vaccination annually for individuals aged 6 months and older without contraindications to prevent and control seasonal and pandemic influenza [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They update information on the dosage for children, antigenic composition and influenza vaccine products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the ACIP recommendations for 20152016 influenza season partially account for risk of transmission, such as influenza immunized individuals caring for immunosuppressed persons are recommended to avoid contact with such persons for 7 days after vaccination, they do not address prioritization of influenza vaccination among subpopulations [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 20092010 influenza pandemic season, the ACIP recommended seasonal influenza vaccination for children above 6 months, adolescents and adults with a focus on individuals at higher risk of influenza complications, or are close contacts of persons at higher risk [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In February 2010, ACIP expanded the recommendation of annual influenza vaccination to any person aged above 6 months who does not have contraindications to vaccination, taking effect from the 20102011 influenza season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It took months to develop and distribute the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar scenarios of delay in vaccine introduction with limited vaccine efficacy and limited supplies are not unlikely in future influenza pandemics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding and analysis of these challenging scenarios through computational modeling and simulation to improve influenza prevention and control programs is the primary motivation of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prioritization_of_influenza_vaccine_intervention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evidence on the epidemiological and economic impact of vaccination for all age and risk groups from the societal standpoint assists in prioritization of influenza vaccine intervention, especially when vaccine supplies are limited, and minimize the direct cost of clinical care for influenza related health outcomes and indirect cost of productivity loss due to workplace absenteeism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some studies have analyzed the direct epidemiological and economic impact of vaccine intervention strategies on controlling influenza pandemics [413], other studies have analyzed both the direct and indirect epidemiological and economic impact of influenza vaccination [1416].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are also prior studies that focused on the prioritization of vaccination and other interventions among people in different age groups [1719].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study adds to the evidence of prior studies by using a detailed agent-based model for estimating the direct and indirect effects of epidemiological and economic impact of vaccine-based interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The objective of the vaccine interventions is to minimize deaths, hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and the number of ill people who do not seek medical care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direct_epidemiological_and_economic_effects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Direct effect is due to the immune protection gained by effectively vaccinated individuals, and indirect effect is due to blocking of the influenza transmission by vaccinated individuals to susceptible individuals in their social network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cost effectiveness of influenza vaccination for 65+ years [5], healthy working adults [6,7], and children [9,20] with a focus on direct effects have been studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prosser et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  evaluate the economic impact of 2009 pandemic influenza vaccine intervention for all age and risk groups [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They infer that vaccination of the subpopulation with a high risk of developing influenza related complications in each age group is cost saving, and vaccination of the healthy subpopulation in each age group is cost effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies have inferred that vaccine administration during previous and potential pandemics produces health benefits in terms of number of averted influenza cases and related health outcomes [1012].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies included the direct cost of hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and deaths, and included the related costs of vaccine production and administration, and lost productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the risk and age group of the subpopulations, geographic region, and analytic methodology, the vaccine interventions may or may not be cost effective [21,22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Indirect_epidemiological_and_economic_effects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Indirect effects account for the indirect protection due to vaccine intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effectively vaccinated individuals who develop protective immune response to the prevalent influenza strains, cut off transmission pathways to secondary and subsequent individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indirect effect of vaccinating school children has been found to be significant, due to their high connectivity in the social network and significance of their transmission pathways to their households and community [2327].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Medlock et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  recommend influenza vaccine prioritization of school children and adults aged 30 to 39 years [15], Lee et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  recommend prioritization of vaccinating at-risk individuals first rather than children first by analyzing the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, matching the 2009 ACIP recommendations [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The epidemiological benefits and economic costs estimated by taking into account only the direct effect is relatively conservative, in comparison to taking into account both the direct and indirect effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We improve the fidelity and robustness of the cost-benefit estimates to facilitate optimal prioritization of our vaccine interventions among different age and risk groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 illustrates the evaluation of the epidemiological and economic impact of influenza vaccine intervention using the static model (direct effects only) and dynamic model (direct + indirect effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_objective  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Meltzer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  estimate the potential net value of different vaccination strategies, and identify vaccination priorities for different age and risk groups during an influenza pandemic [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Monte Carlo based static model is used to estimate the costs and benefits due to the direct effect of vaccine interventions in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focus our study on similar influenza related health outcomes, risk levels and age groups as Meltzers study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use an agent-based dynamic model to estimate the direct and indirect epidemiological and economic impact of vaccine interventions during an influenza pandemic in Chicago, and assist in the assessment of vaccine intervention priorities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Public_health_significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Population dynamics play an important role in influenza pandemic planning and response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Influenza vaccination not only protects effectively vaccinated individuals who develop a protective immune response from contracting influenza, but also prevents the spread of influenza in the social contact network of people by breaking the transmission chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To optimally allocate limited resources, it is important to inform decision makers and public health officials about both the direct and indirect effects of influenza vaccine interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Dynamic_agent-based_modeling_of_Chicago_synthetic_population  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Chicago metropolitan area is a major urban area in the United States, and had high influenza incidence during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the impact of vaccine-based interventions on pandemic influenza in Chicago, using the population distribution of 9,047,574 people from the census data [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disease diffusion occurs on a collocation based synthetic social contact network for Chicago, based on dynamic agent-based modeling [3032].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated the synthetic population and estimated the social contact network in Chicago through population synthesis, activity assignment, location choice and contact estimation, as illustrated in Table 1 [30,33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The social contact network simulated the movement of individuals throughout the city and estimated the contact times between individuals based on their simultaneous presence at a location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Influenza_transmission_dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transmission dynamics of an influenza-like-illness in the population is simulated using the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model on this synthetic social contact network of Chicago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each person in the model is in one of the following four health states at any time: susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A person is in the susceptible state until he becomes exposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a person becomes exposed, he remains exposed for the duration of the latent period, during which he is not infectious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of the latent period, an exposed person becomes infectious and remains infectious for the duration of the infectious period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A person in the infectious state will probabilistically transmit the disease, based on the transmission rate, to any of his contacts who are in the susceptible state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A proportion of infectious individuals are asymptomatic, and there is a reduction in probability of transmission by an asymptomatic infectious person in comparison to a symptomatic infectious person to a susceptible individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the infectious period, the infectious person becomes recovered (or removed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmissibility is the probability of transmission per minute of contact with a symptomatic infectious person and is set to 0.00008, 0.00009, and 0.0001 to calibrate the simulation for the moderate, strong and catastrophic influenza pandemic scenarios respectively, with attack rates of 11.73%, 21.96% and 30.15% respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation parameters for the social contact network and influenza dynamics are illustrated in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate the direct and indirect effects of vaccine interventions on influenza pandemics of moderate, strong and catastrophic severities, in comparison to the base case scenario of no vaccine intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Influenza_related_health_outcomes__risk_levels_and_age_groups  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Influenza related health outcomes for the infected individuals are death, hospitalization, outpatient visits, and ill but not seeking medical care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The risk levels are high and non-high, and the age groups are 019 years, 2064 years and 65+ years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on pre-existing medical conditions, influenza infected individuals may be at a high or non-high risk of experiencing influenza related health outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of the four influenza related health outcomes among the high and non-high risk cases in the three different age groups is based on the study by Meltzer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Base_case_scenario_of_no_vaccine_intervention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the base-case scenario of no vaccine intervention, three different severities of an influenza pandemic were simulated using the dynamic model: moderate influenza with 11.73% attack rate, strong influenza with 21.96% attack rate, and catastrophic influenza with 30.15% attack rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the dynamic model to simulate the epidemic curves for these 3 attack rates for the base-case scenario of no vaccine intervention, based on the average incidence from 25 replicates (see Fig 2 and Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation timeline of the influenza pandemics are in accordance with prior experiences of influenza pandemics in the United States [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 Appendix describes the risk space of transmissibility and clinical severity for the pandemic scenarios, as defined by the framework for assessing epidemiologic effects of influenza epidemics and pandemics by Reed et al [35,36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Vaccine_intervention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effectiveness of influenza vaccines varies between 10% to 60% [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the impact of the vaccine intervention scenario of 40% efficacy and 40% compliance for all age and risk groups, following Meltzer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It took months to develop and distribute the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine, and similar scenarios of delay in vaccine introduction, limited vaccine efficacy and limited supplies are not unlikely in future influenza pandemics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, we analyze delays in the implementation of the vaccine intervention with limited efficacy and compliance rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direct_epidemiological_effect_of_vaccine_intervention_using_static_model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Static model is used to estimate the direct benefit of influenza vaccination, that is, vaccination only protects effectively vaccinated individuals who develop protective immune response, but does not account for preventing influenza transmission from effectively vaccinated individuals to their social contact network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the simulation results of the base-case scenario of no vaccine intervention from the dynamic model, the influenza attack rates of moderate, strong and catastrophic pandemic scenarios are decreased by the proportional impact of the vaccine intervention at 40% coverage and 40% efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, the influenza attack rates in the 3 age group sub-populations are decreased by 16% (40% efficacy * 40% compliance) in each of the three pandemic scenarios (see Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direct_and_indirect_epidemiological_effects_of_vaccine_intervention_using_dynamic_model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We simulated the vaccine intervention scenarios at 40% efficacy and 40% compliance for all age and risk groups in the dynamic agent-based model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vaccine intervention is initiated 15 days after the start of the pandemic and is carried out for 60 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamic model simulates the diffusion of influenza on the population in Chicago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It takes into account the indirect effect of limiting disease diffusion by vaccinated individuals, who develop protective immune response and cut off transmission pathways to secondary and subsequent individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The influenza attack rates for the 3 age groups in moderate, strong and catastrophic pandemic scenarios are estimated (see Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 includes the epidemic curves (based on 25 replicates of each scenario) for the three pandemic scenarios with the vaccine intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Vaccine_cost  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cost of influenza vaccine is estimated to be $28.62, and includes the clinical personnel, non-clinical personnel, and all overhead costs [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct medical costs and indirect productivity losses were estimated from a prior study, and are presented in Table 5 [3942].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pandemic_cost_estimation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on Meltzers study [4], we developed a decision tree that includes the probability distribution of an influenza case experiencing the influenza related health outcomes of death, hospitalization, outpatient visits, and ill but not seeking medical care, and the cost associated with these health outcomes among the different age and risk groups (see Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All costs have been adjusted to 2015 US$ (see Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used this decision tree to estimate the cost due to influenza related health outcomes among the different age and risk groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cost estimation process is conducted in all the three scenarios: base case scenario of no intervention using dynamic model, vaccine intervention scenario using static model, and vaccine intervention scenario using dynamic model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each of these scenarios, for each pandemic severity (moderate, strong and catastrophic), we compute the pandemic cost, pandemic cost per capita, net benefits, and return on investment, as illustrated in Table 6 (also, see Tables 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pandemic cost is the total cost associated with the health outcomes of influenza cases and the cost of vaccination, and pandemic cost per capita is the average pandemic cost per person.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net benefits are the difference in cost due to improved health outcomes from vaccination and the vaccination cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Return on investment is the gain in net benefits relative to the vaccination cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Perspective_of_economic_evaluation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted economic evaluation from the medical and productivity perspective, and includes the direct cost of clinical care for influenza related health outcomes incurred by the health care provider and indirect cost of productivity loss incurred by the patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extend this analysis to a societal perspective, costs incurred by the federal government in vaccine distribution, vaccine coverage monitoring, vaccine effectiveness monitoring, vaccine safety monitoring, health communication, and national coordination and technical assistance [43], productivity loss of volunteers in the influenza vaccine campaign, and costs of global influenza surveillance for vaccine strain selection will need to be included, which are beyond the scope of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simulation_replicates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The values of the simulation parameters and their sources are shown in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each influenza pandemic scenario in the agent-based model is simulated 25 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The costs of influenza-related health outcomes among the different age and risk groups are estimated using the decision tree (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agent-based model is executed through SIBEL [44], a web-based tool to conduct epidemiological disease studies based on realistic social network simulation, and the influenza-related health outcome estimation using decision tree and cost-benefit analysis is executed through the R software for statistical computing and graphics [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sensitivity_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted univariate sensitivity analysis for vaccine compliance, vaccine efficacy and vaccine start date, and their impact on attack rates and return on investment for catastrophic, strong, and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios with no vaccine intervention (base case), and with vaccine intervention in static model (direct effect) and dynamic model (direct + indirect effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Base_case_scenario_of_no_vaccine_intervention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pandemic cost per capita is $678.10, $486.67 and $255.18 for catastrophic, strong, and moderate influenza scenarios respectively (see Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The attack rate is 30.15%, 21.96% and 11.73% for catastrophic, strong, and moderate influenza scenarios respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reproduction number is 1.19, 1.13 and 1.06 for catastrophic, strong, and moderate influenza scenarios respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pandemic cost per capita is positively correlated with attack rate and reproduction number, with the highest in catastrophic influenza scenario followed by the strong and moderate influenza scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Vaccine_interventions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The vaccine intervention is simulated at 40% compliance and 40% efficacy, using the static model and the dynamic model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vaccine intervention decreases the pandemic cost per capita, attack rate and reproduction number in the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios in both the static and dynamic models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4A, 4B and 4C illustrate the comparison of pandemic cost per capita, attack rate and reproduction number in the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios with and without vaccine intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the catastrophic influenza pandemic scenario with vaccine intervention, the pandemic cost per capita, attack rate and reproduction number are $370.56, 16.34% and 1.09 respectively in the dynamic model, while they are $581.09, 25.33% and 1.15 respectively in the static model (see Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the strong influenza pandemic scenario with vaccine intervention, the pandemic cost per capita, attack rate and reproduction number are $90.81, 3.90% and 1.02 respectively in the dynamic model, while they are $420.28, 18.45% and 1.11 respectively in the static model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the moderate influenza pandemic scenario with vaccine intervention, the pandemic cost per capita, attack rate and reproduction number are $14.85, 0.16% and 1.00 respectively in the dynamic model, while they are $225.83, 9.85% and 1.05 respectively in the static model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Molinari et al estimated the annual economic impact (medical costs and productivity loss) of seasonal influenza in the United States to be $87.0673 billion (95% CI: $47.2153, $149.5086) in 2003 with the vaccine intervention [40], which relates to an inflation adjusted cost per capita of $392.24 (95% CI: $212.71, $673.54) in $2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the pandemic cost per capita with no vaccine intervention to be $678.10, $486.67 and $255.18 (in $2015) for catastrophic, strong, and moderate influenza scenarios respectively, and with vaccine intervention to be $370.56, $90.81 and $14.85 respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direct_and_indirect_effects_on_return_on_investment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the vaccine interventions are cost-beneficial in both the dynamic and static models, the return on investment is relatively higher in the dynamic model due to the combined impact of direct and indirect effects, in comparison to the static model which includes only the direct effect (see Fig 5 and Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prioritization_of_vaccine_intervention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vaccine prioritization criteria includes risk of death, total deaths, net benefits, and return on investment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 8 shows the values for risk of death, total deaths, net benefits, and return on investment of high and non-high risk groups among the 019, 2064, 65+ years subpopulations for the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prioritization criteria of risk of death, total deaths, net benefits, and return on investment assist in the decision making process for vaccine prioritization among different age and risk groups, as shown in Table 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Risk_of_death  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 6A illustrates the prioritization criteria for the vaccine intervention based on the risk of death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the catastrophic influenza pandemic scenario, the risk of death among the high-risk 65+ years subpopulation is the highest at 392.18 deaths per 100,000 influenza cases, while it is the lowest among the non-high risk 019 years subpopulation at 6.63 deaths per 100,000 influenza cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the strong influenza pandemic scenario, the risk of death among the high-risk 019 years subpopulation is the highest at 281.08 deaths per 100,000 influenza cases, while it is the lowest among the non-high risk 019 years subpopulation at 5.04 deaths per 100,000 influenza cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the moderate influenza pandemic scenario, the risk of death among the high-risk 019 years subpopulation is the highest at 157.85 deaths per 100,000 influenza cases, while it is the lowest among the non-high risk 2064 years subpopulation at 2.65 deaths per 100,000 influenza cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Total_deaths  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 6B illustrates the prioritization criteria for the vaccine intervention based on the proportion of total deaths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the catastrophic influenza pandemic scenario, the proportion of total deaths among the high-risk 2064 years subpopulation is the highest at 0.45, while it is the lowest among the non-high risk 019 years subpopulation at 0.031.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the strong influenza pandemic scenario, the proportion of total deaths among the high-risk 2064 years subpopulation is the highest at 0.45 while it is the lowest among the non-high risk 019 years subpopulation at 0.033.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the moderate influenza pandemic scenario, the proportion of total deaths among the high risk 2064 years subpopulation is the highest at 0.447, while it is the lowest among the non-high risk 019 years subpopulation at 0.036.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Net_benefits  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 6C illustrates the prioritization criteria for the vaccine intervention based on net benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the catastrophic influenza pandemic scenario, the net benefits among the high-risk 2064 years subpopulation is the highest at $1201.38 million, while it is the lowest among the non-high risk 65+ years subpopulation at $68.80 million.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the strong influenza pandemic scenario, the net benefits among the high risk 2064 years subpopulation is the highest at $1462.52 million, while it is the lowest among the non-high risk 65+ years subpopulation at $79.71 million.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the moderate influenza pandemic scenario, the net benefits among the high risk 2064 years subpopulation is the highest at $864.83 million, while it is the lowest among the non-high risk 65+ years subpopulation at $43.02 million.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fig 6D illustrates the prioritization criteria for the vaccine intervention based on return on investment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the catastrophic influenza pandemic scenario, the return on investment among the high-risk 019 years subpopulation is the highest at 249.16 (i.e., $249.16 saved for every $1 invested in vaccine intervention), while it is the lowest among the non-high risk 2064 years subpopulation at 8.20 (i.e., $8.20 saved for every $1 invested in vaccine intervention).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the strong influenza pandemic scenario, the return on investment among the high-risk 019 years subpopulation is the highest at 367.42 (i.e., $367.42 saved for every $1 invested in vaccine intervention), while it is the lowest among the non-high risk 2064 years subpopulation at 10.18 (i.e., $10.18 saved for every $1 invested in vaccine intervention).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the moderate influenza pandemic scenario, the return on investment among the high-risk 019 years subpopulation is the highest at 248.69 (i.e., $248.69 saved for every $1 invested in vaccine intervention), while it is the lowest among the non-high risk 2064 years subpopulation at 5.64 (i.e., $5.64 saved for every $1 invested in vaccine intervention).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sensitivity_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted univariate sensitivity analysis for vaccine compliance, vaccine efficacy and vaccine start date, and their impact on attack rates and return on investment for catastrophic, strong, and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Direct_and_indirect_epidemiological_and_economic_effects_of_vaccine_intervention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Direct effect is due to the immune protection gained by effectively vaccinated individuals, and indirect effect is due to blocking of the influenza transmission by vaccinated individuals to susceptible individuals in their social network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The static model provides a conservative estimate of the epidemiological and economic benefits of influenza vaccine intervention by accounting for only the direct effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamic model provides a comprehensive estimate of the epidemiological and economic benefits of influenza vaccine intervention by accounting for both the direct and indirect effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The vaccine intervention has a higher probability of effectively vaccinating individuals who will have otherwise being infected in the absence of the vaccine intervention in more severe pandemic scenarios (such as catastrophic influenza).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to relatively higher attack rates and higher proportion of population at risk of influenza infection in comparison to less severe pandemic scenarios (such as moderate influenza).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, the impact of the direct effect decreases from catastrophic, strong to moderate influenza pandemic scenarios (see Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The vaccine intervention has a lower probability of breaking transmission pathways in more severe pandemic scenarios (such as catastrophic influenza), because the transmission network is densely connected in comparison to sparsely connected transmission networks in less severe pandemic scenarios (such as moderate influenza).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, the impact of the indirect effect increases from catastrophic, strong to moderate influenza pandemic scenarios (see Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pandemic cost per capita, attack rate and reproduction number are relatively lower in the dynamic model due to the combined impact of direct and indirect effects, in comparison to the static model which includes only the direct effect, in the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the vaccine interventions are cost-beneficial in both the dynamic and static models, the return on investment is relatively higher in the dynamic model in comparison to the static model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prioritization_of_vaccine_interventions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed vaccine prioritization criteria based on risk of death, total deaths, net benefits and return on investment for the high and non-high risk groups among 019, 2064 and 65+ years subpopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The risk of death is the highest among the high-risk 65+ years subpopulation in the catastrophic influenza, and it is the highest among the high-risk 019 years subpopulation in the strong and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of total deaths is the highest among the high-risk 2064 years subpopulation in the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net benefits are the highest among the high-risk 2064 years subpopulation in the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The return on investment is the highest in the high-risk 019 years subpopulation in the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The proportion of total deaths and net benefits measure the epidemiological and economic impact respectively, and are dependent on the absolute size of the different risk and age group subpopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Risk of death and return on investment measure the epidemiological and economic impact respectively, and are independent of the absolute size of the different risk and age group subpopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on risk of death and return on investment, high-risk groups of the three age group subpopulations are recommended for prioritization of influenza vaccine intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the vaccine intervention is cost-beneficial for all age and risk groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Targeted_vaccination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The attack rates among the children (019 years) are higher than the attack rates among the adults (2064 years) and seniors (65+ years) in the catastrophic, strong, and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios, as illustrated in Table 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be attributed to their larger social contact network and homophilous interactions in schools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, if we target children for vaccination, there will be higher reduction among the children as well on the overall attack rate in the general population, as also illustrated in prior studies by Hodgson et al [16], Ferguson et al [17], and Germann et al [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, as shown in Table 9, high risk children have the highest return on investment from the vaccine intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Public_health_implications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dynamic model provides improved estimates of the epidemiological and economic benefits of vaccine interventions in comparison to a static model, by accounting for both the direct and indirect effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These comprehensive estimates assist in prioritization of vaccine interventions among subpopulations of different risk and age groups, especially during influenza pandemics with limited availability of vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decision makers can use the dynamic model simulations to compare the epidemiological and economic impact of using different prioritization criteria of influenza vaccine interventions among different risk and age group subpopulations, thereby optimizing allocation of limited resources and improving evidence-based public health policy and practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on risk of death and return on investment, high-risk groups of the three age group subpopulations can be prioritized for vaccination, and the vaccine interventions are cost saving for all age and risk groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The attack rates among the children are higher than among the adults and seniors in the catastrophic, strong, and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios, due to their larger social contact network and homophilous interactions in school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on return on investment and higher attack rates among children, we recommend prioritizing children (019 years) and seniors (65+ years) after high-risk groups for influenza vaccination during times of limited vaccine supplies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on risk of death, we recommend prioritizing seniors (65+ years) after high-risk groups for influenza vaccination during times of limited vaccine supplies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Modeling_implications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used an agent-based individual model in this study to estimate the direct and indirect epidemiological and economic impact of vaccine interventions during an influenza pandemic in Chicago, similar to related studies [14,46,47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, a population level compartmental model can also be used to conduct this study, similar to related studies [15,48,49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While agent-based individual models add heterogeneity in contact patterns between individuals in comparison to homogeneous mixing in compartmental models, it will be valuable to compare the vaccine intervention priorities derived from these two modeling methods in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Limitations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a mean estimate of $28.62 (inflation adjusted to 2015 US dollars) for the cost of influenza vaccine, and did not include the range and uncertainty in vaccination costs by location and size of clinical practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While beyond the scope of this study, this analysis can be extended to additional studies for a range of vaccine compliance and efficacy values at different attack rates of influenza pandemics in different rural and urban areas of the United States and at the country level, to infer objective prioritization criteria for influenza vaccine interventions among different risk and age groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
