Current Incentives for Scientists Lead to Underpowered Studies with Erroneous Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We can regard the wider incentive structures that operate across science, such as the priority given to novel findings, as an ecosystem within which scientists strive to maximise their fitness (i.e., publication record and career success).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we develop an optimality model that predicts the most rational research strategy, in terms of the proportion of research effort spent on seeking novel results rather than on confirmatory studies, and the amount of research effort per exploratory study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that, for parameter values derived from the scientific literature, researchers acting to maximise their fitness should spend most of their effort seeking novel results and conduct small studies that have only 10%40% statistical power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, half of the studies they publish will report erroneous conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current incentive structures are in conflict with maximising the scientific value of research; we suggest ways that the scientific ecosystem could be improved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

An individual researcher is able to choose the parameters  (y-axis) and SE; the x-axis shows the resultant power of exploratory studies, WE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  White indicates high fitness, black low fitness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For small values of SE, few papers are accepted, while for high values of SE, few studies are carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For low values of , few novel studies are carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A)  = 0.09,  = 0.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal strategy that maximises individual fitness is therefore to carry out many small exploratory studies with a power of around 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B)  = 0.055,  = 0.55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mixture of exploratory and confirmatory work should be carried out with slightly higher power (20%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The researcher optimises the payoff that results from deciding the proportion of total sampling to spend on exploratory studies () and the sample size of each exploratory study (SE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SE determines the statistical power of each study, namely the probability of detecting an effect (WE), which in turn controls the probability of Type II errors (1  WE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability of a Type I error () is the critical p-value within a null hypothesis significance testing framework; we assume  = 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Power depends on the population variance (2) and the effect size for exploratory or confirmatory studies (rE, rC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values we use are in the middle of the range of effect sizes observed in meta-analyses across a number of biomedical research domains (range r ~ 0.15 to 0.50) [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All studies that find significant results are published, and the high statistical power of confirmatory studies means that the results are informative regardless of statistical significance, so nonsignificant confirmatory studies are published with probability , subject to an independent effect of sample size on the likelihood of acceptance by a journal editor (before consideration of the effects themselves) according to the function:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(B1)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where m is a positive constant (see S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The number of publications from exploratory studies (NE) is the product of the total effort put into exploratory studies divided by the sampling effort of each study, the probability of acceptance given the sample size A, and the probability of getting a statistically significant result:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(B2)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where fE is the probability that an effect is real, T is the total number of samples that can be collected (i.e., total resources), and k is the setup cost for any study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first term in the squared brackets is the probability of a true-positive result, while the second is the probability of a false-positive result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since confirmatory studies will build on the findings of exploratory studies, the probability that a confirmatory study is looking at a real effect (fC) is equal to the probability that a published exploratory study is correct (PF,E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of confirmatory studies that are published (NC) is the sampling effort put into all confirmatory studies divided by the sampling effort of each study multiplied by the probability they are accepted:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(B3)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The terms in the squared brackets are, respectively, the probability of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assume that the number of confirmatory studies per exploratory study is limited to  ( = 10), by calculating the number of valuable confirmatory studies  (see S1 Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The total fitness (VR) of the researcher is assumed to depend on total number of publications with diminishing returns, with an additional bonus for exploratory studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One implementation of this is as follows:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(B4)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Eq (B4),  controls how quickly the value of the total number of publications diminishes, and  controls the extra weighting given to published exploratory studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dependence of equation (B4) on the number of published exploratory and confirmatory studies is shown in S2 Fig for representative values of  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given these assumptions, we identified the optimal research strategy for an individual scientist, which is the combination of  and NE for which the career value of publications (VR) is maximised (i.e., the location of the peak in the fitness landscape, Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See S2 Text for the Matlab code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A reasonable function describing the scientific value of research (VS) is the product of (1) the number of published exploratory studies, (2) the number of published confirmatory studies, and (3) the proportion of published studies that are correct: VS = NCNE(1PF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reflects our assumptions that novel findings (from exploratory work) and confirmatory work are equally important for the advancement of knowledge, provided they arrive at correct conclusions, and that an absence of either of them would be very bad for science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, we assume that a balance of exploratory and confirmatory work is ideal, so that for any number of publications the scientific value is maximised when half are exploratory and half are confirmatory (see S3A Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also considered other reasonable functions, and these provided the same conclusions (see S3 Fig and S5S9 Figs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseline parameter values are given in S1 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parameter  reflects the relative importance of published exploratory studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lines show predictions for two values of the probability that an effect is real (fE) and two values of the effect sizes rC and rE (solid: fE = 0.2, rC = rE = 0.21; dotted: fE = 0.3, rC = rE = 0.21; dashed: fE = 0.2, rC = rE = 0.32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The panels show (A) the optimal proportion of total sampling to spend on exploratory studies *, (B) the optimal sample size of exploratory studies SE*, (C) the resultant total number of published studies NE + NC, (D) the proportion of published studies that are confirmatory NC / (NE + NC), (E) the statistical power of exploratory studies WE, and (F) the proportion of published studies that draw incorrect conclusions (PF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other values: SC = 120, T = 2,000, k = 20,  = 0.05, 2 = 1, m = 3, and  = 0.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chosen values for rC = rE reflect data reported by Richard and colleagues [14], where a correlation coefficient mode of 0.09 and a mean of 0.21 were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are in the middle of the range of effect sizes observed in meta-analyses across a number of biomedical research domains (range r ~ 0.15 to 0.50) [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The figure shows the product of the number of published confirmatory studies, the number of published exploratory studies, and the proportion of published studies that are correct (red = high, blue = low).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measure is calculated for when all researchers are following the rational strategy given the values of  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current emphasis on a small number of publications that report novel findings is characterised by high  and high  (top right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To improve scientific output according to this measure, we could reduce  (i.e., make more published studies count for researchers careers) or reduce  (i.e., reduce weighting of published exploratory studies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the ridge is flat, so any point along it has equal fitness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a pragmatic compromise would be to reduce both  and  by a lesser amount.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The panels show the VT for two values of the dependence of acceptance on sample size m and the Type I error rate : (A)  = 0.05, m = 3, colour range: 2.03.18; (B)  = 0.05, m = 6, colour range: 2.02.82; (C)  = 0.03, m = 6, colour range: 2.02.065.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other values: SC = 120, T = 2000, k = 20, fE = 0.2, rC = rE = 0.21, and 2 = 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The figure shows the proportion of published findings that are correct 1-PF (A, B), the total number of published studies NC + NC (C, D), and the total scientific value of research VT (E, F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We varied the following parameters: the probability of a Type I error  (A, C, E), and the dependence of acceptance on sample size m (B, D, F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lines show predictions for two values of the probability that an effect is real (fE) and two values of the effect size (solid: fE = 0.2, rC = rE = 0.21; dotted: fE = 0.3, rC = rE = 0.21; and dashed: fE = 0.2, rC = rE = 0.32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other values: NC = 120, T = 2,000, k = 20,  = 0.05, 2 = 1, m = 3,  = 0.9, and  = 0.09.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steps occur where there is discontinuity in the effect of  on SE*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
