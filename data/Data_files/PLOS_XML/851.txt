Catastrophic Decline of World's Largest Primate: 80% Loss of Grauer's Gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri) Population Justifies Critically Endangered Status  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Grauers gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri), the Worlds largest primate, is confined to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and is threatened by civil war and insecurity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the war, armed groups in mining camps relied on hunting bushmeat, including gorillas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insecurity and the presence of several militia groups across Grauers gorillas range made it very difficult to assess their population size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a novel method that enables rigorous assessment of local community and ranger-collected data on gorilla occupancy to evaluate the impacts of civil war on Grauers gorilla, which prior to the war was estimated to number 16,900 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that gorilla numbers in their stronghold of Kahuzi-Biega National Park have declined by 87%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encounter rate data of gorilla nests at 10 sites across its range indicate declines of 82100% at six of these sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial occupancy analysis identifies three key areas as the most critical sites for the remaining populations of this ape and that the range of this taxon is around 19,700 km2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate that only 3,800 Grauers gorillas remain in the wild, a 77% decline in one generation, justifying its elevation to Critically Endangered status on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Grauers gorilla, together with the mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei), are two subspecies of eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although mountain gorillas are classified as Critically Endangered by IUCN, Grauers gorillas have been classified as Endangered [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mountain gorillas have been surveyed regularly since the late 1970s and their small numbers are currently increasing [23]; in contrast, there have been few surveys of Grauers gorilla and only one attempt to measure population numbers across its range [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those surveys, made in 199495, used line transects, complete nest counts and reconnaissance surveys to produce an estimate of 16,900 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 199495 surveys did not identify gorilla populations in the Tayna-Usala region; however, which would have increased the total estimate by 1,0002,000 individuals [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Rwandan genocide in 1994 caused hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee to the DRC and this in turn led to the DRC civil war in 1996 [7], which continued until 2003 with devastating consequences, including an estimated five million people killed, increased insecurity, heightened illegal bushmeat trade and increased deforestation [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In eastern DRC, the civil war resulted in the formation of many armed groups, including those born among local communities protecting their interests from other armed groups (Mai Mai militia), particularly over access to mining sites [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Artisanal mining expanded in North and South Kivu provinces, with most mines controlled by armed militia or soldiers from the national army [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Artisanal miners and militia often operate in remote forests, far from villages, and resort to hunting the local fauna to feed themselves, targeting the larger species that provide more meat [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite being protected by law, gorillas are highly prized as bushmeat because of their large size and they are killed relatively easily with guns since they move in groups on the ground [12] and can be tracked more easily than other large primates, such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Concern over the status of Grauers gorilla has been mounting as the insecurity and inability to implement the rule of law in eastern DRC continue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predictions of large declines in numbers have been made with limited data, available from only a few locations [6], making it difficult to extrapolate across the Grauers range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present an assessment of the current status of Grauers gorilla and show that populations have declined drastically across most of its former range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 199495 surveys estimated that Grauers gorillas in Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP), including Kasese to the west, formed 86% of the subspecies total population with the highest densities inside the park [4], and that gorillas in KBNP numbered 7,670 individuals [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using two newly-compiled datasets, we compared 1) density estimates of Grauers gorillas in KBNP and adjacent areas, and 2) encounter rates of gorilla nests from 10 sites across its range: Balala Forest; Itombwe Reserve; KBNP (Tshivanga, Nzovu, Itebero combined with the north of Lulingu, and Kasese sectors); Maiko National Park; two sites in the Reserve des Gorilles de Punia (RGPU; Kasese region); and Usala Forest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then developed an occupancy model with spatial auto-correlation in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to estimate the occupancy probability of gorillas across their range using data collected by park rangers and local community teams who can access the forest even where security is poor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species range and numbers of gorillas are estimated using this model by identifying a threshold probability, maximizing model performance in predicting gorilla presence and absence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three types of data were available that recorded gorilla signs with georeferenced locations: 1) transect data from surveys made in the lowland sector of KBNP between 2011 and 2015; 2) data from reconnaissance walks (recces) to survey presence of gorillas between 2011 and 2015, including visits to specific cells to collect occupancy data; 3) data from patrols made by rangers (in parks) and by local community ecoguards (in community reserves) between 2011 and 2015 and which were stored in freely-available SMART software (Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool - www.smartconservationsoftware.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMART is a new and improved tool for measuring, evaluating and tracking the effectiveness of wildlife law-enforcement patrols and site-based conservation activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recces involve walking in a specific compass direction, but minimising cutting of vegetation by following animal trails or paths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GPS location data were taken at least every 250 metres along transects and at a maximum of every 30 minutes on recces or patrols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wherever sightings of gorillas, or gorilla sign (nests, trails or feeding sign) were observed, a GPS location was also recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JSH and EAW provided data on nest counts from the 1994 transect surveys of Grauers gorilla in KBNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transect data included perpendicular distance measurements to gorilla nests to enable detection probabilities to be calculated using Distance 6.0 [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison_of_density_estimates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Between 2011 and 2015 we surveyed the areas of KBNP covered in 199495 (Itebero and Nzovu sectors) and three other sites: the Kasese Sector, CFCB forest, and the Tayna and Kisimba-Ikobo reserves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we calculated densities and estimated population numbers, we uncovered dramatic declines in nest and gorilla densities in the same sectors of KBNP (Table 1): the Itebero-Lulingu Sector (Zones 13 [5]) and Nzovu Sector (Zone 4 [5]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining the data for both sectors gives an 86.6% reduction in gorilla numbers for the lowland area of this park.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_encounter_rates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparisons of nest encounter rates (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the number of nests counted per km walked on transects) showed major declines (81.7100%) in six of the 10 sites: Balala Forest, Itombwe Reserve, KBNP (Itebero-Lulingu and Nzovu sectors), Maiko National Park, and RGPU north (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smaller declines (510%) in encounter rates were observed in the Kasese Sector of KBNP, RGPU east and Usala Forest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In only one site, the highland Tshivanga Sector of KBNP, was an increase in encounter rates observed (following a drastic decline between 19942000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half the population at Tshivanga was lost in the 1990s, when insecurity compromised the antipoaching activities of the parks staff, but it has since recovered with improved protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steady growth of this population since 2000 is attributed to highly-targeted protection efforts by the protected area authority, the Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN), together with rehabilitation of the gorilla tourism programme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across the six sites exhibiting a major decline, the average rate of decline was 6.0% per year, with an average total decline of 94.2% over the entire range during the past 20 years (19942015).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Occupancy_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three significant environmental variables were identified (distance to active deforestation (m); elevation (m), and tree cover (%)) which together explained 17% of the model fit, and the spatial correlation explained a further 39% (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grauers gorilla is, therefore, found in high altitude areas far from areas where people are clearing forest, with a high tree cover; effectively places people tend not to be.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Occupancy analysis, incorporating this spatial autocorrelation (using an intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive Model), and using these three significant predictor covariables in a Bayesian framework (see methods) showed that KBNP, RGPU and Usala forest remain critical sites for Grauers gorilla conservation (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent of the KBNP-RGPU region where gorillas are present (Fig 1) has decreased in size from previous estimates of 15,870 in 1959 [5, 24] to 12,770 km2 in 1994 [5] to 9,005 km2 today, a 29.5% loss in surface area since 1994 and 43.3% loss since 1959.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other areas of importance for Grauers populations are parts of the Itombwe Reserve, the Tayna and Kisimba-Ikobo community reserves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We computed the probability threshold of the occupancy data (0.35), maximizing the TSS to estimate the area where gorillas are likely to occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area of habitat where the occupancy probability exceeded the threshold was 19,700 km2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A regression of gorilla density on nest encounter rates using data from nine sites was significant (R2adj = 0.96 see Fig B in S1 File) and allowed us to predict gorilla density at the sites for which we had encounter rate data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean density of gorillas across their range was 0.193 km-2, weighted by the area of the site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then estimated the number of Grauers gorillas remaining in the wild by multiplying this area by the mean density and produced an estimate of 3,800 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Survey_coverage_and_gorilla_densities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This survey of Grauers gorilla is the most extensive ever made for this ape [4, 6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More sites were visited than have been previously to obtain quantitative data and more than 12,000 km were walked to obtain the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Field teams conducted intensive surveys even in regions of insecurity where access was possible, searching for ground nests and other signs of this elusive ape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insecurity has cost the lives of more than 150 ICCN rangers in eastern DRC in the past 20 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collecting data on Grauers gorillas is therefore fraught with difficulty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WCS has established SMART databases across much of eastern DRC, in both national parks and community reserves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rangers and ecoguards now have the ability to collect data on illegal activities and record wildlife observations on their smartphones during patrols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used data collected by local community members and ICCN rangers, entered into SMART, because this enabled data to be collated from across most of Grauers gorillas range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMART data are not collected uniformly across an area, but by analysing occupancy in grid cells and employing the novel approach of incorporating spatial autocorrelation in a Bayesian framework, it is possible to estimate the occupancy probability in a rigorous manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitative surveys of great apes are time consuming and expensive, involving line transects and ideally the measurement of decay rates of nests in the region being surveyed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decay rates are often borrowed from other sites because of these costs or lack of time [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tight regression we obtained between encounter rate of numbers of individual nests along transects and the density of gorillas at a site (R2 = 0.96) means that encounter rates, which are easier and less costly to obtain, could be used to estimate gorilla density at sites across Grauers gorilla range in future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
