Play Behavior in Wolves: Using the 50:50 Rule to Test for Egalitarian Play Styles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Social play is known as a cooperative interaction between individuals involving multiple mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent to which the equality of individuals play styles affects the interaction has not been studied in many species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dyadic play between wolf puppies, as well as between puppies and adults, was studied to investigate both self-handicapping and offensive behaviors to determine the extent to which wolves engage in play styles where one individual does not dominate the play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results did not support the hypothesized 50:50 rule, which suggests that more advantaged individuals should show higher rates of self-handicapping behaviors in order to facilitate play with others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult wolves performed significantly less self-handicapping behaviors than their puppy partners, and they performed significantly more offensive behaviors than their puppy partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the 50:50 rule was not supported at any time during our study period, dyads consisting of two puppies had significantly more equal play than dyads consisting of one puppy and one adult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that wolf puppies are more likely to play on equal terms with similarly-aged play partners, while the dominance status of the partners dictates offensive and self-handicapping behaviors between animals of different ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inequity aversion refers to when an individual responds negatively when its conspecific partner receives a more highly valued compensation compared with what it has received for the same action [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been hypothesized that this response has evolved alongside cooperation, as an individuals ability to compare its rewards to its partners would be important in order to recognize a disadvantageous distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this information, the individual could determine whether the partner is worth cooperating with or not [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The majority of inequity aversion studies, which have been carried out with primates, have utilized an experimental set-up in which two individuals must perform a similar behavior for an experimenter to obtain a reward, such as an exchange paradigm [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimenters role in some of these tasks has been questioned, as the inequity response may be a product of the experimental setting and the expectations the animals have in relation to the experimenter rather than to the partner [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering these issues, investigating inequity aversion in situations in which there is no interference by the experimenter, and potentially in a natural setting, would be important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inequity aversion may be relevant to social play [7,8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Social play can be viewed as a competitive interaction between play mates, where individuals test and improve their competitive abilities in a safe context [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, social play has also been suggested to be a cooperative interaction between two individuals and if this is the case, for play to continue, neither of the playmates should be consistently at a disadvantage [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to this hypothesis, individuals should alternate roles within play (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for example, follow a 50:50 rule [11]), so that both playing individuals show winning behaviors, such as chasing or play biting, equally often.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that behaviors such as role-reversing and so-called self-handicapping can be used to maintain equality and thus continue social play [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A role reversal is defined as when an individual which is dominant to its partner outside of the play context displays a behavior during play that it would not normally adopt in an agonistic interaction, such as muzzle-licking in dogs [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the term self-handicapping does not necessarily take the relative ranks of the partners outside of the play context into account but rather refers to when an individual displays a behavior that might put it into a disadvantageous position during play, such as displaying a belly-up posture whilst lying on the ground, or rolling over [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are three types of self-handicapping: social self-handicapping, when a stronger partner takes a disadvantageous position, kinematic self-handicapping, when a partner exhibits a physically demanding position, and sensory self-handicapping, when a partner closes its eyes while acting [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for the purposes of this study, we will discuss self-handicapping only in terms of social self-handicapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The role of equity in play has been investigated only in a few mammalian species, and most studies have investigated whether animals change their behavior within the play context, rather than testing for equity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of the hypothesis of equity in play, Biben [14] showed that adult male squirrel monkeys, Saimiri sqiureus, would play less aggressively and allow more role-reversals with female play partners to whom they were always dominant, potentially to encourage them to play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a small group of adult hamadyras baboons, Papio hamadryas hamadryas, were tested for the presence of self-handicapping during play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results showed that within a pair of play partners, the older individual displayed higher levels of self-handicapping when playing in close proximity to its partners more powerful allies [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the baboons behavior could also be interpreted as submissive behaviors rather than self-handicapping ones, as the older individuals could be better at taking into account when their partner had allies around.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for non-primate species, captive male red-necked wallabies, Macropus rufogriseus banksianus, exhibit higher levels of self-handicapping behaviors towards younger partners, which then allows their partners to gain the advantage during play and take the winning position [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bekoff [17] also suggests that individuals which do not play fairly may be excluded from play groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He observed that in coyote puppies, individuals are less likely to engage in play with others who do not play on an even playing field [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A number of other studies have found little support for animals engaging in self-handicapping or role reversals to achieve equity in play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A study on play in juvenile gorillas found that individuals which gained an advantage over their partners by hitting them were the first to run away, possibly to keep their partner from hitting back [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A study by Pellis and Pellis [20] on Visayan warty pigs (Sus cebifrons) found that this species does not appear to show restraint during play, as when one animal gained the advantage on their partner they were likely to attack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, after this attack, the disadvantaged partners were able to launch a counter-attack approximately 30% of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of several dog studies paired a medium-sized female dog with multiple partners to look at whether or not roll-over behavior within play is a submissive signal [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smaller dogs did not roll onto their backs more, and rolling over behavior was typically categorized as defensive to avoid attacks or offensive to launch attacks, rather than submissive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since the dyads in this study did not know each other beforehand and thus had no relationship with each other, it is still an open question whether or not the dominance relationship between partners affects the exhibition of such behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bauer and Smuts [8] found that during play between adult dogs all frequenting the same dog park, the dogs did not adhere to the 50:50 rule and instead showed varying degrees of asymmetry in their play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, older and more dominant dogs engaged in higher levels of offensive (= winning) behaviors and lower levels of self-handicapping behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals which had an advantage during play, namely through their dominance rank or their age, did not give up their advantage to facilitate play with their disadvantaged partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these findings it seems behaviors that are closely linked to the expression of dominance and submission outside of the play context continue to be exhibited in accordance to rank also within play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A study on dog puppies found similar results, with puppies not following the 50:50 rule within play and the degree of asymmetry increasing with age [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wolves are a highly social species, exhibiting a strong reliance on cooperation for both breeding and hunting as well as territory and kill defense [2224].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, paired with the fact that wolves engage in social play both as puppies and as adults, within and between age groups, suggests they may be a particularly good species to study equity within the play context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only a few studies on wolf play behavior have been carried out, with most of these studies focusing on adult animals, and none looking specifically at inequity aversion or equality within the play context [2529].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we investigate play behavior in wolves as puppies in relation to both the 50:50 rule, and in relation to their dominance relationship outside of play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Looking at previous studies conducted with dogs [7,8] and Cordonis [26] study in wolves, we could hypothesize that wolves will not follow the 50:50 rule, but will maintain the same dominance relationship evidenced outside of play also within the play context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the differing dependence of wolves and dogs on cooperative activities [30], we may expect differences in their propensity for equal play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While wolves are highly reliant on other pack members [22,24], dogs show a much reduced pack involvement in pup-raising [31] and their foraging strategies show a greater reliance on scavenging than group hunting (e.g., scavenging at rubbish dumps, or food provisioned by humans; [3234], but see also [34]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, play behavior in wolves may show a greater symmetry than in dogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether wolves attend to equality by following the 50:50 rule, we calculated a win ratio for each dyad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The win ratio was calculated in terms of the number of times an individual was seen performing an offensive behavior (= being in the winning position), versus the number of times an individual was seen performing a self-handicapping behavior (= being in the losing position).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we did not calculate a winner or a loser for the interaction, but rather, how often either individual was seen in a position, which could be termed winning or losing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These terms are often used in reference to offensive and self-handicapping behaviours, respectively [7,8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Offensive behaviors were defined as those used by individuals to gain a competitive advantage, such as biting and chasing their partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-handicapping behaviors were defined as those used by individuals to give up a competitive advantage to their partner, such as laying on the back as well as being physically under their partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed how the age of the play partner (both puppies or one puppy and one adult) influenced play behavior, but also how pack composition (puppy or mixed-age pack) influenced play behavior within the puppy dyads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, based on general observations of the interactions between individuals, we measured their rank relationships outside of play and analyzed whether this affected the occurrence of offensive and self-handicapping behaviors within the play context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these general observations, we calculated a win ratio for each dyad outside of play in order to compare it to the win ratio for those dyads inside of play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the hypothesis that animals adhere to the 50:50 rule, we tested a number of predictions in relation to the ratio of offensive and self-handicapping behaviors within play and the means by which this ratio might be achieved during play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
50_50_Ratio  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If, in accordance with the 50:50 ratio hypothesis [10,11], wolves play equitably, then the win ratio of most dyads should be situated around 50:50 in the play context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There should also be no correlation between the dyads win ratios inside of play and their win ratios outside of play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if wolves do not adhere to the 50:50 rule, but maintain their relationships from outside of play also within the play context, we should find varying levels of asymmetry in the win ratios of the dyads as was found in dogs [7,8] and they should be correlated with relationship status from outside of play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Bekoff [17], individuals which do not play symmetrically with partners may be avoided in the play contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On this basis, dyads which have less equitable play should engage in less play than dyads which have more equitable play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Offensive_and_Self-Handicapping_Behaviors_within_Play  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to some researchers [11,12], more advantaged individuals should engage in more self-handicapping within play than would be expected in order to keep the play more symmetrical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, based on this hypothesis, the dominant individual within a pair (as established outside the play context) should engage in as many self-handicapping behaviors as the subordinate individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, if wolves do not attempt to maintain equity within play, more advantaged individuals should continue to push their advantage also during play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, dominant individuals should engage in more offensive behaviors and subordinate individuals in more self-handicapping behaviors within play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, in mixed age dyads, if advantaged individuals do exhibit these self-handicapping behaviors to keep play more symmetrical, we would expect these behaviors more in adults when they are playing with puppies, due to their advantage over the puppies outside of the play context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, if wolves do not follow the hypothesis on equity in play, we would expect to see older individuals engaging in higher rates of offensive behaviors, with their disadvantaged partners engaging in higher levels of self-handicapping behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we predicted that if play between wolf puppies followed the pattern of play between dog puppies, then wolves would not follow the 50:50 rule and the subsequent patterns of offensive and self-handicapping behaviors would show no evidence of equity in the play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if the differing dependence of wolves and dogs on cooperation has affected the play behaviors of wolves, then we may find that wolves do follow the 50:50 rule and the subsequent patterns of offensive and self-handicapping behaviors would show evidence of equity in the play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ethical_Statement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
No special permission for use of animals (wolves) in such socio-cognitive studies is required in Austria (Tierversuchsgesetz 2012 TVG 2012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relevant committee that allows running research without special permissions regarding animals is: Tierversuchs-kommission am Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung (Austria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Subjects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two packs of wolf (Canis lupus occidentalis) puppies aged three to five months were observed for play interactions as well as non-play interactions at the Wolf Science Center (WSC) in Ernstbrunn, Austria in 2009 and 2012 respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each pack consisted of six wolf puppies with both kin and non-kin individuals but with no more than two individuals from one litter per pack (see Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wolves were brought to the center by ten days of age and were hand-raised by professional trainers, and thus spent all of their time in the presence of a human from the age of ten days to four months (for more information on raising methods, see [35,36]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During these first four months the puppies lived in a single pack in an enclosure; afterwards, individuals were introduced into previously established packs of adult wolves (into mixed-age packs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2009, the six puppies (4 males and 2 females) were integrated into a previously established group of three adult wolves (2 males and 1 female) from the 2008 litter, and this pack of nine individuals was analyzed for play after introduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2012, the six wolf puppies (3 males and 3 females) were separated into three different, previously-established packs of adults from the 2009 pack as well as from a separate, 2010 litter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To see the details of the packs observed for each study period, as well as information in related individuals, see Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filming for both play and non-play interactions took place in the animals home enclosures, which consisted of large, fenced outdoor areas, raised platforms for shelters, as well many trees and sometimes fallen tree trunks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All interactions were recorded with a video camera (Handycam DCR-SR35 Sony) for later coding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 2009 collection period, all observations were taken from the beginning of August 2009 until the end of November 2009.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 2012 collection period, all observations were taken from the beginning of September 2012 until the end of November 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All observations were distributed throughout the day, from approximately 0600 to 2000 hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two types of data were collected for the purpose of the study: play observations, which were used to code play behaviors, and general observations, which were used to code non-play behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We defined play by indicators as suggested by recent studies on play in canids [7,8,26]; these include the exaggerated, repetitive, and fragmented behaviors in Table 2 which when seen together were used as our working definition of a play bout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A play session began when one partner directed any playful behaviour towards its play partner, and ended when the participants stopped their behaviors or one moved away [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instances in which one animal directed playful behaviors to a partner who ignored them were not considered play and were not included in the analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Videos used for this study were recorded in the framework of an earlier study by Heufelder [38] and re-coded for the purposes of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were started when the focal animal started to play or was already playing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One focal animal was filmed continuously for 5 minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focal animals were chosen after the play had started, rather than before, and were chosen pseudo-randomly in an attempt to keep an evenly distributed amount of focal videos for each individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 5 minutes filming ended, regardless of whether or not the play session had ended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While every occurrence of play was not recorded during the observation time, all occurrences of play on the videos, even if it did not include the original focal individual, were coded and used in the present analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the study period 2009, 8.1 hours of play videos were recorded of the puppy pack, and 5.7 hours of play videos were recorded in the mixed-age pack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the study period 2012, 7.5 hours of play videos were recorded of the puppies in the puppy pack, and 5.9 hours of play videos were recorded in the mixed-age packs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
General observations were taken in study period 2012 to determine dominance relationships between individuals outside of play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were taken in the form of video recording that we subsequently coded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14.2 hours of general observations were recorded in the puppy pack, and 17.7 hours of general observations were recorded in the mixed-age packs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each video, one individual was followed for ten minutes, however, non-play behaviors were coded for all individuals, not just the focal individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allowed us to increase our number of non-play interactions in the analysis of the dominance hierarchy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For study period 2009, we had access to live general observations done on just the focal individual by Stefanie Heufelder [38] using the program Pocket Observer Version 2.1.23.2 (Noldus Information Technology) on an HP iPAQ (Hewlett-Packard) pocket computer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the low number of interactions from these live focal observations, we integrated into our analyses data for both the puppy pack for 2009 as well as the mixed-age pack for 2009 from videos taken for a separate study in a feeding context (unpublished data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both wolves and dogs there is evidence that dominance relationships observed in the social context are mirrored also within the feeding context [39], allowing us to use material from both contexts to calculate the dominance relationships amongst individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used submissive and dominance interactions but not aggressive interactions to determine dominance relationships since aggressive interactions are often not unidirectional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behaviors used to code our general observations are summarized in Table 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the data for each observation period (puppy pack and mixed-age pack) separately, to account for possible changes in the dominance relationships over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Video recordings of the play sessions and the general observations were coded in the program Observer XT 9.0 (Noldus Information Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
General_Observations__Dominance_Relationships  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the mixed-age packs, both the linearity and unidirectionality were high, and where the number of subjects allowed for statistical testing (N6, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kaspar 2009), they proved to be significant (see Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both puppy packs, we have one inconsistency and a lower unidirectionality than in the adult packs, which had no inconsistencies (see Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mixed-age packs, adults were always dominant to puppies (see S7S12 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

50_50__Rule  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the 50:50 rule was not supported in our wolves, since the win ratio during play deviated significantly from an equal distribution in the puppy packs (Mean = 0.007, One-Sample Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks: z = 4.780, pless_than0.001, n = 30) as well as in the mixed-age packs (Mean = 0.25, One-Sample Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks: z = 4.458, pless_than0.001, n = 29) (See Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for each dyad, win ratios inside of play were significantly different from win ratios outside of play for the puppy packs (Two-Sample Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks: z = -2.573, p = 0.01, n = 30) as well as for the mixed-age packs (Two-Sample Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks: z = -2.763, p = 0.006, n = 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wolf puppies did not follow the proposed 50:50 rule during dyadic play, and play ranged from equal to completely unequal within our dyads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that dyads consisting of two puppies engaged in significantly more equal play than dyads consisting of one adult and one puppy in the mixed-age packs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in dyads consisting of two puppies, there was no evidence that the dominance relationship affected either the rates of self-handicapping or offensive behaviors in play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in mixed pairs of one adult and one puppy, puppies engaged in significantly more self-handicapping behaviors, and significantly less offensive behaviors than their adult partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, contrary to predictions based on the 50:50 rule, adult wolves did not facilitate play by exhibiting more self-handicapping and less offensive behaviors towards their partners than would be predicted by their dominance relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, more dominant puppies did not take advantage of their higher position outside of play, engaging in neither more offensive, nor less self-handicapping, behaviors than their lower-ranking puppy partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be due to the fact that the dominance ranks are not fully established yet, nevertheless, the play interactions appear to be more equal than those between adults and puppies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, play between puppies may have a competitive component, with individuals testing their abilities against each other in order to acquire a higher rank in the future [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found no effect of the win ratio on play duration, so again, contrary to predictions based on one of Bekoff's hypotheses, dyads which had more unequal levels of play did not engage in less play than dyads which exhibited more equal play [18], and this was true for both the puppy packs as well as the mixed-age packs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The rates of self-handicapping and offensive behaviors in puppy-adult dyads were tied to the dominance relationship between them, supporting the hypothesis that interactions within play are not separate from the dominance relationship outside of play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subordinate individual performed self-handicapping behaviors within play more frequently than the dominant individual, who performed more offensive behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to reiterate that the dominant individual was invariably the adult individual in the dyad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that adult, dominant wolves performed more offensive behaviors, and young, subordinate wolves performed more self-handicapping behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at least for the mixed-age dyads, the dominant and subordinate roles which are established outside of play are actually maintained within the play context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the mixed-age dyads, puppy dyads did play more equally which might reflect the lower unidirectionality in the puppy packs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced unidirectionality in the puppy packs may be due to hierarchical relationships being poorly defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we found a high degree of linearity and no circular relationships in the analyses of the mixed-age packs, unidirectionality was much lower in the puppy packs suggesting that the puppy-puppy relationships were, at this point, still quite undefined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of defined dominance relationships, which continued also when the puppies were introduced into the adult packs, could also explain why there was no decrease in symmetry in play as the puppies age (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  when they were moved from the puppy packs to the mixed-age packs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While in 2012, all puppies retained their rankings relative to the other puppies once introduced into the mixed-age packs, in 2009, there were some changes in the rank positions of the puppies once introduced into the mixed-age pack (see S7S12 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that the puppy-puppy dominance relationships are in some way affected by the presence of adults, however to what extent the relationships are affected, we cannot speculate with the present data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pairs of rats show a decrease in symmetry in play as they establish their dominance relationship [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Domestic dog puppies decrease their symmetry in play over time when comparing the time periods between 3 to 8 and 10 to 23 weeks of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, however, no such decrease can be detected when comparing the time periods between 10 to 23 weeks of age and 27 to 40 weeks of age [7], which could be due to the establishment of dominance relationships in the later but not earlier weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, no such decrease could be observed despite the fact that our animals were 12 to 20 weeks of age, suggesting the possibility that wolf pups establish their dominance relationships later than dogs and hence play remains more symmetrical for longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this hypothesis needs further testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is important to note that there is a large variability in the equity with which puppy dyads play, with some playing on quite equal terms (see Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since equity during play is not correlated with the dominance outside of play, other aspects of the relationship, for example affiliation, could affect the play style.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In groups of chimpanzees, relationship length, and perhaps relationship quality, does affect inequity aversion [44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, in domestic dogs, pairs with a more affiliative relationship showed higher levels of inequity aversion than pairs with a less affiliative relationship [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, how affiliation affects equity in play needs to be assessed in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our study presents the first evidence, to our knowledge, that wolf puppies do not adhere to the 50:50 rule within the play context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the 50:50 rule is likely not the only way to test for egalitarian play, and there may be other ways that play can be facilitated between individuals which would need further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, adult wolves do not engage in self-handicapping behaviors to facilitate play with puppies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, wolves, like dogs, can and do engage in dyadic play at similar rates regardless of the symmetry of the play between the individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it does not appear that the retained levels of conspecific cooperation within wolves, compared to dogs, has selected for more egalitarian play styles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, future studies should be done on pack-living domestic dogs in order to be able to make more valid comparisons between the two species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
