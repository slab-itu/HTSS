Taxonomic Synopsis of the Ponto-Mediterranean Ants of Temnothorax nylanderi Species-Group  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the current revisionary work, the Temnothorax nylanderi species-group of myrmicine ants is characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eighteen species belonging to this group in the Ponto-Mediterranean region are described or redefined based on an integrative approach that combines exploratory analyses of morphometric data and of a 658bp fragment of the mitochondrial gene for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CO I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The species group is subdivided into five species complexes: T. angustifrons complex, T. lichtensteini complex, T. nylanderi complex, T. parvulus complex, T. sordidulus complex, and two species, T. angulinodis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and T. flavicornis (Emery, 1870) form their own lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe seven new species (T. angulinodis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., T. angustifrons sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., T. ariadnae sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., T. helenae sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., T. lucidus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., T. similis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., T. subtilis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n.), raise T. tergestinus (FINZI, 1928) stat.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to species level, and propose a new junior synonymy for T. saxonicus (SEIFERT, 1995) syn.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (junior synonym of T. tergestinus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe the worker caste and provide high quality images and distributional maps for all eighteen species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we provide a decision tree as an alternative identification key that visually gives an overview of this species-group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We make the first application to Formicidae of the Semantic Phenotype approach that has been used in previous taxonomic revisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The myrmicine genus Temnothorax (formerly synonymized with Leptothorax) is one of the most speciose ant genera on earth, with 380 valid species and 47 subspecies worldwide (http://www.antcat.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is especially well represented in the European fauna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of the genus occur in a great variety of habitats and display a considerable range of social behavior [1] and associations with other organisms [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of their small colony size and easy maintenance in the lab Temnothorax species establish model systems in insect behavioral ecology and sociobiology, including studies on self-organized decision making [3], [4], [5], [6], nest construction [7], [8], nest moving [9], [10], division of labor [11], the regulation of reproduction [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] [17], [18], and host-parasite coevolution [19], [20], [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thanks to intensive studies during recent years [22], [23], [24], [25] the European ant fauna is relatively well explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temnothorax has long been the focus of ant taxonomy, and earlier taxonomic studies are available for particular geographic areas [26], [27], [28], [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Temnothorax nylanderi species-group is particularly diverse in the Ponto-Mediterranean region (i.e., the basin of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea) and its systematics is still very challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those few species that range as far northwest as England and Central Europe are well understood and adequately described by modern taxonomic methodology [30], [31], [32], [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In North Africa and in part the Iberian Peninsula, the T. nylanderi species-group is replaced by the Temnothorax laurae species-group, its vicariant sister group [34], [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high diversity of the T. nylanderi species-group in the Ponto-Mediterranean region is coupled with a large number of cryptic species [36], [33], whose broadly overlapping morphological characters hamper the definition of species boundaries based on conventional techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in the present study we delineate species boundaries in an integrative fashion [37], using multiple lines of evidence, including Numeric Morphology Based Alpha Taxonomy (NUMOBAT) and molecular analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our study we initially recognized morphological patterns using the exploratory data analysis tool NC-clustering [38], which allows inference of the boundaries of morphological entities without prior hypotheses about the number of clusters or the classification of a particular sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The performance of such exploratory data analysis tools allowed formulation of sound hypotheses about formerly unrecognized morphologically cryptic taxa in ants [39], [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initially inferred patterns are subsequently tested by confirmatory data analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To strengthen the consistency of conclusions by the complex morphometric analyses, we in parallel analyzed a fragment of the mitochondrial gene for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CO I) in specimens from all identified morphological clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data reveal cryptic diversity in this species-group of the genus Temnothorax and help to better understand the biogeographic patterns of this genus in the Ponto-Mediterranean region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we recorded 22 continuous morphometric traits in 1693 worker individuals belonging to 526 nest samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens for the present study were borrowed from public and private collections, see the list of institutions below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study did not involve endangered or protected species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Label information of type material is given for each taxon in the section type material investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-type material that was morphometrically examined in this revision is listed in S1 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples displayed in the dendrogram are characterized by sample-specific abbreviations (e.g., GRE:Levidi-10S-20000427-123) generated from the original label information as follows:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A three-letter country code (in capital letters separated from the following part by a colon), the nearest settlement given in the label (separated from the following parts by hyphens), the distance and direction from it, the sampling date in alpha-numeric format and a final unique field sample identifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All images presented are available online on AntWeb (http://www.antweb.org) and can be uniquely identified by their specimen-level codes affixed to each pin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information about the taxonomic history of the taxa redefined below is based on B. Bolton in AntCat (http://www.antcat.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distribution maps were generated by QGIS 2.4.0 software [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For statistical comparisons of morphological data we used R [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Due to the limited number of queens and males available in the present study, our revision is based on the worker caste.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A worker-based revision is further facilitated by the fact that the type specimens of most of the existing taxa are workers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Molecular_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Partial sequences of the mitochondrial gene CO I were used to corroborate the morphology-based definition of new taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We managed to amplify DNA of most of the taxa inspected by morphometry, but amplification failed for T. sordidulus and T. saxonicus and no material was available of T. carinthiacus, T. angulinodis sp.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and T. angustifrons sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. DNA was isolated using the CTAB method including proteinase K digestion [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We amplified a 658 bp fragment of the CO I gene using the primers LCO1490 and HCO2198 [44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For PCR we used the GO-Taq Hot Start Master Mix from Promega (Madison, WI) with a final primer concentration of 0.7 M and 1 l DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR conditions were as described previously [33], i.e., an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 240 s, 38 cycles of denaturation at 94°C, 45 s; annealing at 50°C, 45 s; elongation at 72°C, 1 min; and a final step of 72°C, 300 s. DNA was sequenced in an ABI 3100 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and sequences were aligned using Bioedit [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ambiguous parts at the fragment ends were removed, resulting in a fragment length of 652 bp for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MrModeltest GUI (available under http://genedrift.org) in conjuncture with PAUP 4.0b10 [46] estimated HKY + I + G as best model for the Bayesian analysis, which was performed with MrBayes 3.2.1 [47] with three heated and one cold Markov chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Default heating parameters were set at 0.2 with an MCMC length of 3,000,000 generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first 500 generations (burn-in) were discarded and every 100th generation was sampled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phylogenetic tree was drawn using FigTree version 1.2.2 (available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GenBank accession numbers are given in S2 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protocol_of_morphometric_character_recording  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Morphometric characters are defined as in [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All measurements were made in m using a pin-holding stage, permitting rotations around X, Y, and Z axes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An Olympus SZX9 stereomicroscope was used at a magnification of x150 for each character, allowing an estimated precision of ± 2 m. Morphometric data (in m) are provided in S3 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All measurements were made by the first author.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measured characters are defined and abbreviated as follows:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CL: maximum cephalic length in median line; the head must be carefully tilted to the position with the true maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excavations of hind vertex and/or clypeus reduce CL (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CS: cephalic size; the arithmetic mean of CL and CWb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CWb: maximum width of head capsule, measured just posterior to the eyes (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EL: maximum diameter of the eye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FRS: distance of the frontal carinae immediately caudal of the posterior intersection points between frontal carinae and the lamellae dorsal to the torulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these dorsal lamellae do not laterally surpass the frontal carinae, the deepest point of scape corner pits may be taken as reference line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pits take up the inner corner of scape base when the scape is fully switched caudad and produce a dark triangular shadow in the lateral frontal lobes immediately posterior to the dorsal lamellae of scape joint capsule (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ML: mesosoma length from caudalmost point of propodeal lobe to transition point between anterior pronotal slope and anterior propodeal shield (preferentially measured in lateral view; if the transition point is not well defined, use dorsal view and take the center of the dark-shaded borderline between pronotal slope and pronotal shield as anterior reference point) (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MW: maximum mesosoma width; this is in workers pronotal width (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NOdL: anterior length of petiole measured in dorsal view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distance from the centre of anteriormost seta pit on the petiolar node to the level of the constriction of articulation condyle with propodeum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measuring requires a change of focus from above (seta pit) to below (constriction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsal view is achieved when the dorsalmost point of anterior petiolar peduncle at the level of its strongest constriction and the dorsalmost point of caudal petiolar margin are in the same focal level (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NOH: maximum height of the petiolar node, measured in lateral view from the uppermost point of the petiolar node perpendicular to a reference line set from the petiolar spiracle to the imaginary midpoint of the transition between dorso-caudal slope and dorsal profile of caudal cylinder of the petiole (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NOL: length of the petiolar node, measured in lateral view from petiolar spiracle to dorso-caudal corner of caudal cylinder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Do not erroneously take as reference point the dorso-caudal corner of the helcium, which is sometimes visible (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PEH: maximum petiole height.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chord of ventral petiolar profile at node level is the reference line perpendicular to which the maximum height of petiole is measured (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PEW: maximum width of petiole (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PL: total petiole length measured in dorsal view; distance between the dorsalmost point of caudal petiolar margin and the dorsalmost point of anterior petiolar peduncle at the transversal level of its strongest constriction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positioning of petiole as in NOdL (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PoOC: postocular distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use a cross-scaled ocular micrometer and adjust the head to the measuring position of CL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caudal measuring point: median occipital margin; frontal measuring point: median head at the level of the posterior eye margin (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PPH: maximum height of the postpetiole in lateral view measured perpendicularly to a line defined by the linear section of the segment border between dorsal and ventral petiolar sclerite (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PPL: maximum length of the postpetiole measured in lateral view perpendicular to the straight section of lateral postpetiolar margin (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PPW: maximum width of postpetiole (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SL: maximum straight line scape length excluding the articular condyle (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SPL: minimum distance between the center of propodeal spiracle and the subspinal excavation measured in lateral view (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the same view that is applied to measure ML).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note: in lateral view propodeal spiracle and the caudal margin of propodeal declivity might not be in the same focal level, hence slight adjust might be necessary while measuring SPL between the two endpoints (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SPBA: the smallest distance of the lateral margins of the spines at their base.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This should be measured in dorsofrontal view, since the wider parts of the ventral propodeum do not interfere with the measurement in this position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the lateral margins of spines diverge continuously from the tip to the base, a smallest distance at base is not defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, SPBA is measured at the level of the bottom of the interspinal meniscus (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SPST: distance between the center of propodeal stigma and spine tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stigma centre refers to the midpoint defined by the outer cuticular ring but not to the centre of real stigma opening that may be positioned eccentrically (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SPTI: the distance of spine tips in dorsal view; if spine tips are rounded or truncated, the centers of spine tips are taken as reference points (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SPWI: maximum distance between outer margins of spines; measured in same position as SPBA (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The deviation of propodeal spines from longitudinal mesosomal axis (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  angle between the spines and the mesosomal axis) is often of high diagnostic value within the Temnothorax nylanderi species-group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longitudinal mesosomal axis is defined by Seifert et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [39] as follows: in lateral view as straight line from the center of propodeal lobe to the border point between anterior pronotal shield and propleuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Semantic_phenotype_approach  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We represent natural language phenotypes in an EQ format: Entity attribute: value (S6 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Semantic statements of natural language phenotypes (S6 Table) were composed in Protégé 5.0 (http://protege.stanford.edu/) using the OWL Manchester syntax (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/) following [49] and [50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full data set, represented in OWL (Web Ontology Language; http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/ last accessed February 4, 2014), was deposited as a Resource Description Framework (RDF)-XML file (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/ in the Dryad repository (http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xxxx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hereby we propose two new template EQ expression as an expansion of the semantic statement types described by Balhoff et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [49] and Mikó et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [50]:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Angle between anatomical lines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Angles between anatomical lines are often used in taxonomic treatments of Formicidae:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We expressed angle value between anatomical lines using PATOs angle and UOs degree with the combination of our previously proposed relative and absolute measurement phenotypes:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coloration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present color hue and intensity as separated entity attributes:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NL: Body color: brown  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
and  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Morphometric_hypothesis_formation_and_testing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The complexity of the Temnothorax nylanderi species-group required a complex work flow for morphometric pattern recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined stepwise analyses were done to achieve the best results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iterated confirmatory analyses (Steps 2 and 3) helped to support the position of various samples predicted by prior steps (Step 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multivariate_Analyses_of_Numeric_MorphologyHypothesis_formation_and_Confirmatory_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An exploratory NC-Clustering revealed the existence of eighteen clearly separated clusters within the available specimens of Ponto-Caspian populations of the Temnothorax nylanderi species-group (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern was confirmed by a cumulative Linear Discriminant Analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The confirmatory analyses correctly classified 94% of the 1693 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Validation by Leave One Out Cross Validation yielded a 93% classification success rate, which can be considered acceptable in such a complex, multidimensional discriminant space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vast majority of species showed a perfect or nearly perfect separation from other morphospecies treated in this revision: T. angulinodis sp.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (100%), T. angustifrons sp.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (98.5%), T. ariadnae sp.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (100%), T. artvinensis (95.8%), T. flavicornis (100%), T. laconicus (94.9%), T. lichtensteini (97.3%), T. lucidus sp.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (94.3%), T. parvulus (97.1%), T. schoedli (93.8%), T. similis sp.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (94.7%), T. sordidulus (95.6%) and T. subtilis sp.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (95.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A few others yielded a lower classification success: T. crasecundus (89.6%), T. crassispinus (90.4%), T. helenae sp.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (91.3%), T. nylanderi (90%), and T. tergestinus (89.9%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is probably not surprising, given the the high morphological similarity among some of the closely related species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some taxa could be separated convincingly only by confirmatory LDA of nest sample means: 98.5% of the 528 nest samples were correctly classified by this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again a few species, T. crasecundus (98.2%), T. crassispinus (97.47), T. laconicus (93.8%), T. lichtensteini (98.8%), T. subtilis sp.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (98.2%) and T. tergestinus (94.0%) attained somewhat lower rate, but nest samples of all other species treated in this revision were correctly classified (100%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The species hypothesis generated by the NC-clustering, with 18 existing morphospecies, was thereby confirmed by LDA and can be considered as the final species hypothesis in this revision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Partial sequences of the mitochondrial gene CO I were available for specimens from most of the clusters recognized by morphometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Bayesian tree (Fig 3) fully supported most of the morphospecies well classified by LDA of nest sample means with Bayesian posterior probabilities close to 1 (T. ariadnae sp.n., T. artvinensis, T. flavicornis, T. helenae sp.n., T. lucidus sp.n., T. nylanderi, T. parvulus, T. schoedli, T. similis sp.n,).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the molecular data also substantiated T. tergestinus, less well supported by morphometry, as a separate lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Molecular analysis reliably distinguished neither T. laconicus and T. lichtensteini nor T. crasecundus and T. crassispinus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This matches the slightly lower support of these taxa in the morphological analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The various specimens of T. subtilis, though with high classification rate by morphometry, did not form a distinct cluster in the molecular analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The placements of a worker from Bistrits, Bulgariamorphologically identified as T. crassispinusamidst specimens of T. lichtensteini and that of one worker of T. subtilis from Akseki, Turkey, near T. schoedli and T. flavicornis remains unexplained and might be due to an accidental exchange of specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It was not aim of the study to provide a robust phylogeny of the here investigated taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basal nodes of the tree show only very weak support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our analysis supports the T. nylanderi complex, the T. parvulus complex, and the T. lichtensteini complex as monophyletic groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned above, the two taxa of the T. lichtensteini complex clustered together but could not be distinguished reliably.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Temnothorax angustifrons complex is not supported by the molecular data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, T. lucidus sp.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  forms a weakly supported outgroup to the T. nylanderi complex, and T. similis sp.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  falls into the T. parvulus cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the taxa of the T. sordidulus complex are scattered throughout the whole phylogenetic tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Key_to_worker_caste  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following dichotomous identification key for the worker caste of the Temnothorax nylanderi species-group was generated by Decision Tree in R [41] based on continuous morphometric traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It provides an easy-to-use identification guide, which is also displayed graphically in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reliability of characters has been tested and the percentages at each node indicate the classification success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key is based on nest sample means (which require the investigation of 2 to 3 individuals from each nest).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because the range of morphometric traits calculated from nest sample means is more or less identical with the 595% percentile range of the pool of single individuals, the key is also expected to work on single specimens with high probability ( greater than 95%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional information is available in differential diagnoses, which helps to identify the most problematic cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Descriptions_and_redefinitions_of_species_and_species-complexes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The description and redefinition of species belonging to the Ponto-Mediterranean Temnothorax nylanderi species-group can be found following the diagnoses of species complexes to which they belong.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species complexes are defined based on morphological similarities, but not fully supported by molecular (mtDNA) data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patterns formerly recognized by NC-clustering were tested by confirmatory Linear Discriminant Analysis (Steps 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of complex-wise analyses (Step 3) are displayed in scatterplots for each species-complex defined below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent taxonomic papers on Temnothorax taxa [33], [48], [39] were considered in preparing descriptions and redefinitions of the species treated in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The varying degree of inclination of pilosity follows [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Definitions of surface sculpturing are linked to [54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Definitions of species complexes as well as descriptions of species belonging to a certain complex are given in alphabetic order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Body size is given in m and morphometric ratios are given as means.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the differential diagnosis, we give the means of discriminant scores, minimum and maximum, and 595% percentiles to prevent that abnormal cases are misidentified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nest sample means of ratios of morphometric variables are given in S4 Table for each species with standard deviation in italics followed by minimum and maximum in parentheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the diagnosis of species complexes, minimum and maximum values of body ratios are indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Diagnosis_of_Temnothorax_angulinodis_species-complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Workers of the Temnothorax angulinodis species-complex can be distinguished from those of other complexes treated in this revision by the combination of the following salient features: brown to black color; longer than broad head (CL/CWb [1.171, 1.222]), sculpture of head dorsum shiny: with inconspicuously areolate ground sculpture combined with parallel costulate main sculpture (Fig 5A); petiolar node in lateral view with a straight or weakly concave frontal profile meeting dorso-caudal plate in an acute angle (7282°) with a sharp ridge, in dorsal view appearing as conspicuous semicircular anterior-lateral rim (Fig 5B); long propodeal spines (SPST/CS [0.332, 0.369]), deviating from longitudinal axis of mesosoma by 3238° (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This peculiar species-complex consists of a single species, Temnothorax angulinodis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., which is only known from the Peloponnese peninsula.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This species is clearly defined by NC-clustering and corroborated by LDA (Fig 2, S5 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Workers of the Temnothorax angustifrons species-complex can be distinguished from those of other complexes by the combination of the following salient features: light yellow to light brown color; moderately longer than broad head (CL/CWb [1.135, 1.254]), sculpture of head dorsum shiny, with inconspicuously areolate ground sculpture combined with feeble costulate main sculpture; short to moderately long propodeal spines (SPST/CS [0.159, 0.267]), deviating from longitudinal axis of mesosoma by 4752°; petiolar node in lateral view with a weakly concave frontal profile meeting dorso-caudal plate in an obtuse angle (95105°) with a moderately sharp ridge, in dorsal view appearing as a visible (occasionally inconspicuous) anterior-lateral rim.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exploratory NC-clustering (Fig 2) revealed the existence of four species (Temnothorax angustifrons sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., T. lucidus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., T. similis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., T. subtilis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n.) within this complex, which was confirmed by LDA (S5 Table, Figs 6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of this species-complex are known to occur in Turkey and Crete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of two samples found in Greece may be ascribed to anthropochory, i.e., dispersal by human activities (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
