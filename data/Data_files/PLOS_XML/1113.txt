Genomic Footprints of Selective Sweeps from Metabolic Resistance to Pyrethroids in African Malaria Vectors Are Driven by Scale up of Insecticide-Based Vector Control  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insecticide resistance in mosquito populations threatens recent successes in malaria prevention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elucidating patterns of genetic structure in malaria vectors to predict the speed and direction of the spread of resistance is essential to get ahead of the resistance curve and to avert a public health catastrophe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, applying a combination of microsatellite analysis, whole genome sequencing and targeted sequencing of a resistance locus, we elucidated the continent-wide population structure of a major African malaria vector, Anopheles funestus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a major selective sweep in a genomic region controlling cytochrome P450-based metabolic resistance conferring high resistance to pyrethroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This selective sweep occurred since 2002, likely as a direct consequence of scaled up vector control as revealed by whole genome and fine-scale sequencing of pre- and post-intervention populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fine-scaled analysis of the pyrethroid resistance locus revealed that a resistance-associated allele of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP6P9a has swept through southern Africa to near fixation, in contrast to high polymorphism levels before interventions, conferring high levels of pyrethroid resistance linked to control failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Population structure analysis revealed a barrier to gene flow between southern Africa and other areas, which may prevent or slow the spread of the southern mechanism of pyrethroid resistance to other regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By identifying a genetic signature of pyrethroid-based interventions, we have demonstrated the intense selective pressure that control interventions exert on mosquito populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this level of selection and spread of resistance continues unabated, our ability to control malaria with current interventions will be compromised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Malaria control currently relies heavily on insecticide-based vector control interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, resistance to insecticides threatens the continued effectiveness of these measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolic resistance, caused by increased detoxification of insecticides, presents the greatest threat to vector control, yet it remains unclear how these mechanisms are linked to underlying genetic changes driven by the massive selection pressure from these interventions, such as the widespread use of Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs) across Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, understanding the direction and speed at which this operationally important form of resistance spreads through mosquito populations is essential if we are to get ahead of the resistance curve and avert a public health catastrophe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using microsatellite markers, whole genome sequencing and fine-scale sequencing at a major resistance locus, we elucidated the Africa-wide population structure of Anopheles funestus, a major African malaria vector, and detected a strong selective sweep occurring in a genomic region controlling cytochrome P450-based metabolic pyrethroid resistance in this species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrated that this selective sweep is driven by the scale-up of insecticide-based malaria control in Africa, highlighting the risk that if this level of selection and spread of resistance continues unabated, our ability to control malaria with current interventions will be compromised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Scaling up of malaria prevention and treatment has averted over 660 million cases of malaria since 2000 [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vast majority of this reduction has come from mosquito control with pyrethroid insecticide-based interventions, primarily the use of long lasting insecticide-treated bednets (LLINs) and, to a lesser extent, indoor residual spraying (IRS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resistance to insecticides in major malaria vectors such as Anopheles funestus threatens the continued success of these interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless resistance is managed, the massive reduction of malaria transmission from scaling up these interventions could be reversed [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key prerequisite for resistance management is to understand the evolution of insecticide resistance to predict the speed and direction of spread of resistance and provide vital information to implement successful control strategies [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are multiple mechanisms of insecticide resistance, these include changes to insecticide target molecules that render the insecticide unable to bind, behavioural changes leading to the avoidance of insecticide contact, thickening of the insects cuticle to prevent the insecticide reaching its target and detoxification of the insecticide before it reaches its target (metabolic resistance).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, metabolic resistance has the greatest operational significance [3, 4], yet it remains unclear how mosquito populations exhibiting these mechanisms respond to insecticide-based interventions including LLINs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective sweeps associated with target-site resistance have been assessed in mosquito species [5, 6] but no such assessment has been made for metabolic resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the major malaria vector An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus, pyrethroid resistance is mainly conferred by metabolic resistance associated with a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) at which two duplicated cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b) are the main resistance genes [7] [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predominance of metabolic resistance in An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus makes this species very suitable to assess metabolic resistance-based evolutionary responses of mosquitoes to the massive scale up of pyrethroid-based vector control interventions across Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the context of increasing reports of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors such as An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus across Africa [916], it is important to determine the relative contributions to this of gene flow and of the autochthonous appearance of insecticide resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies suggest significant genetic structure among An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus populations across Africa [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether such differences in genetic structure explain the contrasting insecticide resistance patterns seen in this species [916] and could help predict the speed and direction of spread of resistance remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, using microsatellite analysis, whole genome sequencing and fine-scale sequencing at a resistance locus, we elucidated the Africa-wide population structure of An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus and detected a strong selective sweep occurring at a major cytochrome P450-based pyrethroid resistance locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we demonstrated that this selective sweep is driven by the scale-up of insecticide-based malaria control in Africa, highlighting the risk that if this level of selection and spread of resistance continues unabated, our ability to control malaria with current interventions could be compromised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
1-African-wide_microsatellite_diversity_shows_evidence_of_positive_selection_on_An_funestus_chromosome_2R  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of genetic diversity at 11 microsatellites from across the An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus genome sampled in six populations from West (Ghana and Benin), Central (Cameroon), East (Uganda) and southern Africa (Malawi and Mozambique) revealed reduced diversity in two microsatellites at the telomeric end of chromosome arm 2R (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These microsatellites; AFUB6, located in a genomic region spanning a pyrethroid resistance QTL (rp1) and FunR, located in the same QTL in the 5' un-translated region of the pyrethroid resistance gene CYP6P9a (Fig 1B), showed few alleles and low heterozygosity (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesised that this low diversity was due to a selective sweep in this QTL region driven by pyrethroid-based vector control interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further localise the putative sweep, we genotyped 5 additional microsatellites upstream and downstream of FunR and AFUB6 on chromosome 2R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This revealed that the reduced diversity was restricted to the two markers within rp1 (S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our hypothesis, the lowest gene diversity at FunR was seen in the two southern African populations from Malawi and Mozambique (Fig 1A), which also show the highest levels of pyrethroid resistance [4, 18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

3-Assessing_the_role_of_insecticide-based_interventions_in_the_selective_sweep_in_southern_Africa  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Due to the stronger signature of selection observed in the highly pyrethroid resistant populations of southern Africa, we aimed to establish if insecticide-based interventions were driving this selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mosquitoes collected in Malawi and Mozambique in 2002, predating the scaling up of malaria control interventions in southern Malawi and southern Mozambique were compared to mosquitoes collected in the same areas in 20092010 to determine whether the selective sweep coincided with the scale-up of pyrethroid-based vector control interventions that occurred over this period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

4-Whole_genome_sequencing_validates_the_selective_sweep_at_the_rp1_locus_as_the_major_genomic_difference_between_pre-_and_post-intervention_mosquitoes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pooled template sequencing was carried out on two pools of mosquito genomic DNA: one from mosquitoes collected in 2014 and one from mosquitoes collected in 2002 in Malawi (S7 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were aligned to the FUMOZ reference genome (S8 Table) and stringent filtering performed to remove SNPs at the extremes of coverage depth (S9 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of a total of 979,808 variant sites genotyped in both samples detected 3,078 variant sites (on 368 genomic scaffolds) with significantly different allele frequencies between 2002 and 2014 collections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant correlation was observed between the number of significant sites plotted against total scaffold length (pless_thanless_than0.01 for both Pearsons and Spearmans tests) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a number of outlier scaffolds appear to be enriched for significant sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most extreme of these is scaffold KB669169, with more than 400 significant variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scaffold contains the rp1 locus and most of the significant sites are clustered around this region (Fig 4B) with a striking loss of diversity between 2002 and 2014 evident across the locus (Fig 4C and 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This valley of reduced variability around rp1 is the typical signature of selective sweeps as previously observed in other pool-seq studies [21, 22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In no other scaffold was the signature so striking (S7 Fig), which validated the results of our microsatellite and targeted sequencing analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rp1 region of scaffold KB669169 contains a number of sequencing gaps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure this did not affect our conclusions, sequence data were additionally aligned to the sequenced 120kb BAC clone containing rp1 [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confirmed the results observed in the whole genome analysis (Fig 4E; S8 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2014 post-intervention sample exhibits a pattern similar to FUMOZ (the pyrethroid resistant laboratory colony) at rp1 with reduced diversity spanning the cytochrome P450 cluster including the duplicated CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b genes, whereas the 2002 pre-intervention sample is highly diverse across the locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to help maintain the continued success of current insecticide-based malaria control interventions, this study has established the Africa-wide population structure and the full genomic signature of pyrethroid-based interventions in a major malaria-transmitting mosquito providing key evidence of the evolutionary response of mosquito populations to the massive scale up of insecticide-based interventions in Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
1-Patterns_of_genetic_structure_across_An_funestus_populations_support_the_presence_of_barriers_of_gene_flow  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study revealed that southern African populations of An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus are more genetically differentiated to other populations as they always form a unique cluster compared to other African regions based on both Bayesian analyses and Fst estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The population from Uganda appears to be intermediate between southern and West/Central Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is similar to patterns of genetic structure previously reported for this species [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patterns of genetic structure observed in this study support the contrast in resistance patterns between populations of An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus and suggest the presence of barriers of gene flow between populations of this species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The causes of these barriers remain unknown although it could be associated with the absence of An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus around the Equatorial belt, or the presence of the Rift Valley which affects the population genetic structure of An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such hypothesis will need to be validated by assessing more populations, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from both sides of the Rift Valley.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patterns of gene flow described here for An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus give an indication on the risk and speed of spread of insecticide resistance alleles between these populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further supported by the observation that the 119F resistance allele of the GSTe2 gene conferring DDT resistance probably arose in West or Central Africa, where it is common, but remains absent from southern Africa, despite selection pressure from DDT use [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

2-Pyrethroid_resistance_is_associated_with_a_signature_of_positive_directional_selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study identified a major selective sweep on the 2R chromosomal arm, its location coinciding with that of the main pyrethroid-resistance QTL explaining 85% of genetic variance to resistance, and containing key cytochrome P450 genes conferring pyrethroid resistance [7, 24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, multiple analyses provide evidence for a selective sweep on the 2R chromosome driven by metabolic cytochrome P450-based pyrethroid resistance; (i) Reduced diversity of microsatellites flanking pyrethroid resistance genes on 2R in Malawi and Mozambique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Reduced genetic diversity of genomic sequences flanking pyrethroid resistance genes on 2R in Malawi and Mozambique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) Reduced genetic diversity of the CYP6P9a gene in Malawi and Mozambique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) No signature of a selective sweep prior to the widespread use of LLINs and IRS in Malawi and Mozambique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether, this study provides conclusive evidence of the extensive selective sweep acting on cytochrome P450-based metabolic resistance to insecticides in mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that positive selection on the region spanning the rp1 pyrethroid resistance locus in Anopheles funestus has occurred in southern Africa between 2002 and 2009 in response to the increased use of pyrethroid-treated bednets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No major change in agricultural use of pyrethroids has occurred in southern Africa over this period, but LLIN use and, to a lesser extent pyrethroid-based IRS, has been scaled up massively in this period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the risk of relying on a single insecticide class for vector control and emphasizes the need for novel insecticides and vector control tools to tackle the spread of resistant vector populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mosquito_collections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anopheles funestus mosquitoes were collected between 2009 and 2010 from the following locations: Chokwe, Mozambique (24° 33S, 33° 01E); Chikwawa, Malawi (16° 3S, 34° 50E); Tororo, Uganda (0° 45N, 34° 5E); Lagdo, Cameroon (9° 05N, 13° 40E); Pahou, Benin (6° 23'N, 2° 13'E); and Obuasi, Ghana (6° 12N, 1° 40W).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional collections in southern Africa were made in 2011 in Salima (13° 57S, 34° 30E) and Nkhotakota (12° 56S, 34° 17E) in Malawi, plus collections from Chikwawa and Mozambique in 2002.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic DNA was extracted from whole mosquitoes using the method of Livak [40] or the DNeasy DNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA Mosquitoes were identified morphologically [41] and were species-typed using An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus sensu stricto-specific PCR primers [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only confirmed An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus s.s. mosquitoes were used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Contrasting resistance profiles have been described for various populations of An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus across Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the resistance pattern observed in North Cameroon in 2007 (DDT and dieldrin resistance)[16] is different to that of southern Africa (high pyrethroid, DDT and carbamate resistance)[4, 15], East Africa (pyrethroid and DDT resistance but full susceptibility to carbamates)[12] and Ghana (West Africa) (DDT resistance and pyrethroid resistance)[14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microsatellite_genotyping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microsatellite markers were chosen to span the entire genome [17, 43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mosquitoes were collected from six countries (Obuasi, Ghana: N = 45, Pahou, Benin: N = 48, Lagdo, Cameroon: N = 48, Tororo, Uganda: N = 48) with two collection time points in Chikwawa, Malawi (2010: N = 48, 2002: N = 48) and Chokwe (2009: N = 48) and Morrumbene (2002: N = 45) Mozambique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17 microsatellites (both di- and tri-nucleotide repeats) were amplified from genomic DNA using 1.5 l of reaction Buffer, 0.2 l of dNTP mix (25 mmol), 0.325 l of both the forward (included a 19bp tag) and reverse primers, 0.2 l of Hot Start Taq (Qiagen Inc.), 1 l of MgCl2 and 1l of genomic DNA (15ng/ul).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forward and reverse primers are listed in S1 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR thermocycler conditions were: 5min at 95°C followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 94°C for 30s, annealing at 58°C for 30s and extension at 72°C for 30s, finishing with an extension step at 72°C for 10min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fragment sizing was carried out using a Beckman Coulter CEQ8000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fragment sizes were visualized and recorded using the fragment analysis software on the Beckman Coulter CEQ8000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micro-Checker version 2.2.3 [44] was used to check for null allele and scoring errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Population_genetic_analysis_of_microsatellites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microsatellite data analysis was mainly carried out using Genepop version 4.0.10 [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tests for deviation from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) were carried out for each locus using Genepop option 1.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The null hypothesis was HWE and the alternative hypothesis a deficit of heterozygotes, and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing used to adjust the 0.05 and 0.01 critical values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inbreeding coefficient FIS, linkage disequilibrium (LD), log likelihood ratio statistics (G-test) and tables created using Markov chain algorithm of Raymond & Rousset [45] were all preformed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene diversity at each microsatellite locus, estimated by 1-Q(inter) where Q(inter) is the homozygosity among individuals, and among populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic differentiation (FST) were estimated using Genepop [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pairwise Fst values were used to generate neighbour joining trees using the software MEGA 5.2 [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bayesian_analysis_of_population_structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bayesian analysis of population structure was implemented using STRUCTURE version 2.3.4 [47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individually based admixture models were used to estimate the ancestral allele source observed in each individual, where the ancestral source population is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 285 individuals from six African countries, genotyped at 16 loci, were analysed for cluster number K = 112 (10 replicate runs for each) using a set of 9 putatively neutral loci and comparing 8 2R loci to the 8 non-2R markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A burn-in period of 50,000 generations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations of 100,000 iterations were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The admixture model was used as it allows individuals to have mixed ancestry where a fraction (qk) of the genome of an individual comes from an ancestral cluster (where tkqk = 1)[47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structure Harvester [48] was used to infer the most likely number of clusters (K) using Evannos method [49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLUMPP [50] was used to collate the data from all 10 runs for each given K value, for plotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_polymorphism_in_the_pyrethroid_resistance_rp1_QTL_and_the_CYP6P9a_gene  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Five DNA fragments evenly spaced to span the 120kb BAC, originally isolated using a laboratory colony, FUMOZ [7], upstream and downstream of CYP6P9a were sequenced in order to assess the presence of a selective sweep around this key resistance gene across Africa (Cameroon, Malawi and Mozambique).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers used to amplify the fragments are listed in S1 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A subset of 10 mosquitoes used for the microsatellite analysis were randomly selected from each collection site for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For BAC fragments, 770-1000bp were sequenced using: 3 l of 10X KAPA Taq buffer A (KAPA Biosystems), 0.24 l of 5 U/l KAPA Taq, 0.24 l of 25 M dNTP mix, 1.5 l of 25M MgCl2, 1.02 l each of antisense and sense primers, 2 l of gDNA (10ng), and 22.48 l of dH2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 30 l solution underwent a denaturing step at 95°C for 5min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30s, 57°C for 30s and 72°C for 1min and 30s, followed by a final extension step of 72°C for 10min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CYP6P9a gene was amplified from the same gDNA samples used for the rp1 BAC analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CYP6P9a was amplified, covering the 5 UTR, the genes two exons and one intron with a total sequence of approximately 2kb using previously published primers and parameters [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit and directly sequenced using Sanger sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were first analysed for quality then manually assessed for polymorphisms using BioEdit [51].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were aligned using ClustalW [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Heterozygous sites in sequence data were phased using the PHASER algorithm implemented in DnaSP version 5.10 [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all sequences, DnaSP was used to calculate the number of segregating sites (S), the number of haplotypes (h), the nucleotide diversity () and the haplotype diversity (Hd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two tests of neutrality, Tajimas D and Fu and Lis D*, were also carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sequences encoding proteins, 1524bp of the CYP6P9a gene, the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous polymorphisms and nonsynonymous (KA) and synonymous (KS) polymorphisms per site were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KST statistic in dnaSP 5.1 [54] was used to estimate the levels of pair-wise genetic differentiation between populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical significance of the KST* estimates was assessed by permutation of subpopulations identities and re-calculating KST* 10,000 times as implemented in dnaSP5.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hudson, Kreitman and Aguades (HKA) and McDonald and Kreitmans (MK) tests of neutrality were performed using the An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae orthologue of CYP6P9a, CYP6P3 (AGAP002865-PA) as an out-group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the MK test on the BAC25 fragment, which spans the CYP6AA2 gene in An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus, the An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae CYP6AA2 gene (AGAP002862-PA) was used as an out-group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees where generated for the BAC25 sequences (Tamuras Model) and for CYP6P9a (Kimuras 2-parameter model) using MEGA 5.2, with 500 bootstrap replicates [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haplotype networks were determined, based on a 95% connection limit with gaps treated as a fifth state, using TCS [55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual haplotypes were labelled by colour and shape (circle denoting haplotypes unique to only one sequence, squares denote haplotypes containing multiple sequences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Whole_genome_sequencing-based_scan_of_selective_sweep_in_pooled_mosquitoes_pre-_(2002)_and_post-intervention_(2014)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A whole genome scan was performed comparatively between pre- and post-intervention mosquitoes in order to detect all selective sweep signatures associated with the scale-up of insecticide-based interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pooled template whole genome sequencing libraries were generated as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic DNA was purified from individual female mosquitoes collected from Chikwawa in Malawi in 2014 and 2002 using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturers instructions and including an RNase treatment step to remove RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gDNA from each mosquito was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, USA) on a FLUOstar Omega Microplate Reader (BMG Labtech, Aylesbury, UK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal quantities of gDNA from 40 individuals for each collection were pooled in equal amounts and the pools used to generate Illumina TruSeq Nano DNA fragment libraries (Illumina, San Diego, USA) with an insert size of 350bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Libraries were sequenced (2x125bp paired-end sequencing) on different lanes of an Illumina HiSeq2500 (Illumina) at the Center for Genomics Research (University of Liverpool, UK), each multiplexed with three other libraries (not used in this study), to produce approximately 50,000,000 read pairs per library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Raw sequence reads were trimmed of adapter sequence and low quality bases, using cutadapt [56] and sickle [57], and filtered to remove trimmed reads shorter than 10bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trimmed reads were aligned to the Anopheles funestus (FUMOZ) reference genome sequence (version Afun1.3) downloaded from VectorBase [58], using bowtie2 [59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aligned reads were filtered to remove duplicate reads and those not properly paired (mapped in forward and reverse orientation within 500bp of each other) or with mapping quality less_than10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retained reads were used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SNP calling was carried out using SNVer [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNPs were filtered to remove those called in regions of in the top or bottom 25% of read coverage depth, to remove artefacts caused by misaligned paralogous sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variant sites with coverage data within the allowed range for both libraries were analysed to identify those with significantly different allele frequencies in each pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A chi-squared test for a significant difference in allele frequency was applied to each variant site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg [61] and sites with an adjusted p-value less than 0.05 were considered significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a rolling mean non-reference allele frequency was calculated and plotted for sets of 101 adjacent sites incremented by one site per step across each scaffold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
