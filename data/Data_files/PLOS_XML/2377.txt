The Chicago School Readiness Project: Examining the long-term impacts of an early childhood intervention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current paper reports long-term treatment impact estimates for a randomized evaluation of an early childhood intervention designed to promote children's developmental outcomes and improve the quality of Head Start centers serving high-violence and high-crime areas in inner-city Chicago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial evaluations of end-of-preschool data reported that the program led to reductions in child behavioral problems and gains in measures of executive function and academic achievement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this report, we analyzed adolescent follow-up data taken 10 to 11 years after program completion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found evidence that the program had positive long-term effects on students executive function and grades, though effects were somewhat imprecise and dependent on the inclusion of baseline covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results also indicated that treated children had heightened sensitivity to emotional stimuli, and we found no evidence of long-run effects on measures of behavioral problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings raise the possibility that developing programs that improve on the Head Start model could carry long-run benefits for affected children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Early childhood interventions have received substantial policy attention with the hope that providing high quality early educational environments to children from underserved communities can offset the effects of poverty on long-run development [1,2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, evidence from experimental studies regarding this hypothesis is surprisingly scarce and mixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, too few studies of early interventions have followed children beyond the elementary school years, leaving questions as to whether early intervention effects should be expected to persist into adolescence or adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current study evaluated the long-term effects of the Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP), a cluster-randomized design preschool intervention that aimed to improve the chances of early school success for children living in high-poverty and high-crime neighborhoods in inner city Chicago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intervention, which provided teachers with professional development and coaching that targeted student behavioral management and teacher stress reduction, was administered in Head Start classrooms, and it was designed to improve the quality of Head Start while also promoting childrens self-regulation and executive functioning [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial evaluations showed that the intervention positively affected the quality of the preschool classroom environment [3], as well as measures of childrens self-regulation [4], executive function and academic achievement [5], and it was predicted that these early impacts on child-level skills and behavior would persist in the long-term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current paper, we report program impacts on a broad array of adolescent outcomes collected 10 to 11 years after program completion, including measures of executive function, academic achievement, behavioral problems, and emotional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Early_intervention_and_long-term_effects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An alarming 13.3 million children live below the poverty line in the United States [6], and research suggests that a substantial fraction of these children will face higher rates of emotional, behavioral and mental health problems throughout their lives, including depression and anxiety and greater levels of health and behavioral risk-taking [710].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, children growing up in economically under-resourced, ethnic minority neighborhoods face major disparities in access to higher quality education, with high school graduation rates for African American and Latino students severely lagging behind the national average [11,12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More troubling, research clearly indicates that spending the early childhood years [typically defined as ages 0 through 5] in poverty substantially increases the risk of detrimental effects on long-term development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longitudinal studies suggest that exposure to poverty during early childhood, even when accounting for exposure during middle childhood and adolescence, strongly predicts a host of negative adult outcomes, including lower earnings and poor labor market success [13], fewer years of completed schooling [14], and higher rates of obesity [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Policymakers and researchers have increasingly turned to early intervention as a means of offsetting the adverse effects of poverty exposure on development (for reviews see [1,2,16,17]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rationale for such investments is straightforward: If interventions can positively affect childrens cognitive and socioemotional development during the formative years of early childhood, then such effects may place children on more positive lifelong trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the evidence in support of this hypothesis is mixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, a small set experimental studies, bolstered by a larger set of quasi-experimental studies, have found positive effects for early childhood interventions on measures of long-term attainment, such as high school graduation rate [18,19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, some recent experimental work has found that early childhood interventions often produce substantial positive effects at the time of program completion, only to see these effects fade to 0 in the few years after the intervention ends [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This pattern of fadeout is best illustrated by the findings reported in a recent meta-analysis by Bailey and colleagues of 67 high-quality early childhood interventions evaluated through randomized control trials published between 1960 and 2007, as the meta-analytic average treatment effect across studies was observed to have a precipitous decline during the 3 years following intervention [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This disconcerting pattern of effects suggests that theories that predict that early intervention will lead to sustained changes in childrens long-term trajectories may be flawed or incomplete, and interventions targeted at the earliest stages of development may not be as cost-effective as initially hoped if effects inevitably fade out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, there remain compelling reasons to continue to investigate whether successful early interventions may produce effects measured into adolescence or adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, other reviews and meta-analyses that included quasi-experimental evaluations of early childhood programs have found evidence of positive long-run effects [18,19,21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Camili and colleagues analysis of 123 early childhood interventions, all of which included some type of comparison group, found evidence that early intervention had effects on long-run measures of cognitive ability [18], and a recent meta-analysis by McCoy and colleagues, which also included quasi-experimental work, found that early intervention affected long-term educational outcomes such as high school graduation [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, three well-documented intervention studies, the Perry Preschool Program [2225], the Abecedarian Early Intervention Project [26], and the Chicago Child Parent Centers program [27,28], all produced positive effects measured through adolescence and, in some cases, adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, these findings are further supported by correlational studies that have consistently demonstrated the strong relation between early gains in cognitive and socio-emotional skills and long-term developmental outcomes [21,29,30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, the question of whether long-run effects should be expected following a successful early intervention remains open.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple reviews of the literature [18,20,21] have argued that the presence of long-term impacts is likely governed by key program features, such as the types of skills targeted by the intervention and the difference in quality between the environment offered by the program and the environment encountered in the counterfactual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these reviews have also noted the need for more experimental intervention evaluations with longitudinal follow-up, as we need additional evidence from interventions with different programmatic features to better understand when long-term effects are likely to be found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current study aims to provide new longitudinal experimental evidence to further contribute to the literature base on early childhood interventions, as we analyzed data collected 10 to 11 years after the completion of a successful early childhood intervention that substantially boosted low-income childrens cognitive and socioemotional functioning measured at the end of preschool [4,5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Chicago_School_Readiness_Project  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP) was conceived as an early childhood intervention designed to bolster childrens self-regulation and executive function skills through changing the classroom quality of Head Start centers operating in high-poverty and high-crime neighborhoods within inner-city Chicago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CSRP intervention model was supported by research that suggested that childrens early educational experiences could be substantially improved by targeting teachers behavioral management strategies, and improvements to teacher behavioral management should help improve childrens own self-regulation abilities [3134].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By changing the way teachers supported the development of childrens early self-regulation, the intervention was expected to help children become more positively engaged, attentive learners during their earliest school experiences, and gains in self-regulation were hypothesized to set children on a higher achieving trajectory throughout school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CSRP targeted Head Start centers because of Head Starts unique role as the primary early education service provider for low-income families in the U.S., and other studies have shown that well-designed programs could be integrated into the Head Start model (e.g., [3539]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overarching goal of improving classroom practices and child self-regulation was enacted through a multi-component model, as the CSRP targeted services to the children, families and teachers of participating Head Start centers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CSRP targeted childrens self-regulation skills by providing teachers with extensive professional development designed to help them improve their classroom behavioral management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-regulation describes a childs ability to focus and maintain attention, regulate behavior in order to positively interact with peers and adults, and regulate emotion in the face of stress and anxiety [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Executive function (EF) is considered to be the cognitive component of self-regulation, and EF involves activation of the sub-areas of the prefrontal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When faced with stress and adversity, children with higher-level executive functioning are better able to plan ahead, maintain focus, and rely on cognitive flexibility to solve difficult problems [3941].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not surprisingly, these skills are essential for early school success [34,4244], as self-regulation supports the acquisition of new information by allowing children to focus and sustain their attention as well as to suppress impulsive responses in favor of better academic engagement [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longitudinal work has also shown that self-regulation skills help students transition into college [46], and children who self-regulate have lower rates of criminal behavior and better health outcomes as adults [29,47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because children with exposure to poverty and poverty-related stressors are at greater risk for more self-regulatory difficulty [48,49], CSRP specifically targeted self-regulation as a way to provide children with a skill that could substantially alter their long-term school experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous research suggests that self-regulation skills are key in shaping childrens early school relationships with peers and teachers [50,51], and childrens early behavioral problems have been implicated as a likely cause of low childcare quality in Head Start centers [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preschool teachers working in low-resource areas are often ill-equipped to deal with the trauma-related behavioral challenges facing children living in impoverished neighborhoods [53], and this lack of training can lead to punitive and coercive behavioral management strategies that may actually exacerbate childrens early behavioral problems [54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observational work has also shown that teachers in high-poverty classrooms spend a disproportionate amount of time on behavioral management, taking away crucial time for academic instruction, which may be particularly important for supporting the academic achievement of low-income populations [55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, by providing teachers with better behavioral management strategies, CSRP was designed to bolster students self-regulation skills, while also improving the quality of the classroom environment by supporting the relationships between teachers and children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the program also directed services directly at Head Start teachers, with the understanding that teaching in Head Start centers serving communities in high-poverty and high-crime areas could lead to substantial stress and burnout [53,56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of training and support given to teachers working in severely under-resourced communities has been shown to lead to high rates of teacher turnover, and the low-pay afforded to teachers also makes them less likely to access mental health services for their own psychological wellbeing [57,58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, CSRP provided teachers with access to mental health consultants (MHC), who conducted several stress-reduction workshops throughout the year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MHCs each held a masters degree in social work, and they visited the classroom weekly for a period spanning 4 months to help teachers implement the behavioral management strategies introduced during the student-focused professional development sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MHCs also provided direct intervention services to 3 to 4 children per class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These children had been flagged as having especially severe behavioral or emotional problems, and they were given the opportunity to meet with MHCs for either individual or group therapy sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, the CSRP program offered a fairly comprehensive approach to improving the quality of the Head Start environment as it targeted both student behavioral and emotional regulation as well as teacher psychological stress and burnout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial evaluations suggested that the program was implemented with a high degree of fidelity, and analyses of classroom observational measures indicated that CSRP teachers provided Head Start children with significantly better-managed and more emotionally supportive classrooms when compared with teachers in the control condition [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the program affected a broad set of child-level competencies measured at the end of preschool, with evaluations reporting that the program reduced childrens behavioral problems (ds = 0.530.89) [4] and boosted childrens EF, reading, language, and math skills (ds = 0.200.63) [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This initial evaluation work suggested that through changing the quality of the classroom, and through improving childrens interactions with their teachers, the CSRP boosted measures of self-regulation and also positively affected childrens academic school readiness skills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was hypothesized that these initial benefits would produce long-lasting impacts on childrens cognitive and socio-emotional trajectories, but follow-up work was mixed and inconclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence of fadeout on child measures of behavioral regulation and academic achievement was found in the early years of elementary school [59], though there was some indication that children who attended higher-quality elementary schools may have had longer-lasting intervention benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, a recent follow-up study employed a mixed growth curve modeling approach, and found that the treatment may have caused reductions in the likelihood of following an increasing trajectory of internalizing behavioral problems during elementary school [60], but these effects were relatively small and for only a subset of children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, these prior follow-up studies lacked the broad set of measures used at the end of preschool, making this study the first complete attempt to understand the long-term impacts of the CSRP intervention on the full set of developmental domains originally hypothesized to be affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Current_study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the current study, we analyzed newly-collected measures of adolescent functioning, collected 10 to 11 years after children first participated in the CSRP intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data allowed us to test whether the CSRP program had long-term effects on indicators of childrens executive function, academic achievement, behavioral problems and emotional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected this set of measures because it closely reflected the set of measures first used to assess program efficacy at the end of preschool [4,5], and because these measures have been shown to be important indicators of adolescent wellbeing [61,62] and critical predictors of adult attainment [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on theoretical and empirical work that has shown that the early acquisition of self-regulation and academic achievement skills support childrens long-term cognitive and socio-emotional development [34,29], we expected that the CSRP would have positive impacts on measures of adolescent executive function and achievement, and we also expected that adolescents assigned to the treatment group would have less behavioral problems and a greater capacity for regulating emotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our expectations were tempered by work showing fadeout in the years following early intervention [20], and given the paucity of early interventions with long-term follow-up, we had no strong prediction for the effect sizes that we might detect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Method  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ethics_statement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All research procedures and protocols including participant recruitment materials were reviewed and approved by the University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects at New York University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parents of participating subjects provided consent and all participating children and adolescents provided verbal assent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CSRP program was evaluated through a cluster-randomized design, and Head Start sites were recruited based on four criteria: 1) receipt of federal Head Start funding; 2) having two or more classrooms that offered full-day classes; 3) location in a set of high-poverty Chicago neighborhoods that contained high crime rates, low rates of mobility, and a substantial portion of families living below the poverty line; 4) completion of a screening self-nomination procedure [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recruitment process led to 18 Head Start centers participating in the study, with centers grouped into pairs based on a set of 14 site-level characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within these pairs, which we subsequently refer to as blocking groups, sites were randomly assigned to either treatment or control, and treatment sites implemented the CSRP intervention program described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control sites continued business-as-usual, but classrooms in control sites were provided with part-time teaching aides to account for the changes in student-to-teacher ratio brought on by MHCs in treatment sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The program was implemented for two different cohorts of students and teachers, with Cohort 1 participating in 20042005 (57% of the sample) and Cohort 2 participating in 20052006.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two classrooms from each of the 18 Head Start sites were selected for study participation, and evaluators successfully recruited 83% of students from these classes to participate in data collection (student n = 602).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the school year, one classroom in the control condition lost Head Start funding due to budget cuts, which resulted in 35 total classrooms participating in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the beginning of the preschool year (i.e., baseline), information regarding the childs family and home environment was obtained via parent survey, and childrens cognitive, behavioral and emotional functioning were measured via direct assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observers blind to treatment status also rated the quality of the classroom environment at baseline, and teachers responded to surveys that measured their professional and educational experiences, as well as their perceptions of their classroom and school environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Teachers were also surveyed regarding the behavioral problems of each child participating in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the spring, teachers again evaluated childrens behavioral problems, and study examiners again assessed childrens mathematics, literacy, attention and executive functioning via direct assessment (i.e., post-treatment outcomes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The participants of the study have been followed into adolescence, and the current study reports on data collected during the 20152016 school year, which occurred 11 years after the treatment year for Cohort 1 and 10 years after the treatment year for Cohort 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By the 20152016 follow-up year, 466 adolescents remained in the study (236 in the treatment group and 230 in the control group), and this 23% rate of attrition did not statistically significantly differ between the groups (p = 0.51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of the assessment, approximately 70% of participants were in high school, and 30% of the sample remained in middle school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This grade-level difference was largely due to the 2 cohort design of the study, though grade repetition and the substantial variation in student age at baseline (M = 4.1 years, SD = .65, range: 2.156.08) also contributed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intervention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recall that the CSRP program consisted of 4 key components: 1) professional development to improve teacher behavior management strategies in support of children's self-regulation; 2) MHC classroom visits to assist teachers in implementing the behavioral management program; 3) MHCs provision of stress reduction workshops; 4) MHC services targeted at children identified as having especially severe emotional and behavioral issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intervention lasted 30 weeks, with MHC support occurring throughout the intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full intervention details have been described in previous reports [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we provide a brief overview of key program features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Follow-up_measures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Table 1, we present each follow-up measure collected next to the analogous outcome measure collected at the end of preschool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This table hilights the conceptual link between the original outcomes assessed and the outcomes considered in the current paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, we were not able to collect as many measures for each construct as was originally collected at the end of preschool, but as with the end-of-preschool assessments, our follow-up indicators were also measured through both direct assessment and survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe each follow-up measure collected during adolescence in detail below, and we provide information regarding the original end-of-preschool measures in the supplementary materials (S1 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All follow-up measures were completed as part of a 60- to 90-minute computerized assessment battery programmed using Inquisit 4.0.8, a psychological measurement software capable of being tailored to execute various types of assessments [65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Inquisit software was programmed to include measures of executive function, emotional regulation, and behavioral problems into the battery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The battery was then presented on HP Stream 11.6-inch notebooks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Programming the battery into laptops allowed participants to be assessed across a range of accessible settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The battery was administered to participants in the Chicago metropolitan area by trained assessors at school or at home, depending on participants and schools availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out-of-area participants were guided to install and complete the battery on their own computers by trained assessors over the phone or web conference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Baseline_measures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the supporting information (S3 Appendix), we present a complete list of all baseline measures included in our treatment impact analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These characteristics, all assessed in the fall of the Head Start year, have been described at length in previous reports [4,5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present a brief overview of each measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analytic_approach  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that the CSRP intervention would have impacts on our measures of executive function, academic achievement, behavioral problems, and emotional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test our hypotheses, we began by regressing each dependent variable on treatment status and a series of blocking group fixed effects:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Outcomeij represents a respective measure of adolescent executive functioning, academic achievement, behavioral problems, or emotional functioning for the ith child in blocking group j and Txij represents the treatment status dummy indicator (coded 1 for treatment and 0 for control).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included a series of blocking group fixed effects to account for the cluster-randomized design of the study, and including the series of blocking groups also controls for cohort status, as each block was either in cohort 1 or cohort 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this equation, 1 represents the treatment impact, which will be unbiased only if the error term, eij, is uncorrelated with treatment assignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, our treatment effect estimate would only be unbiased if random assignment produced groups completely balanced on observable and unobservable characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because we found evidence of differences between the treatment and control group at baseline (see further description below), we rely on regression models that include covariates for the host of characteristics assessed during the fall of the Head Start year:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Outcomeij and Txij are defined as before, but Childij, Familyij, and Teacherij represent sets of controls for child, family, and teacher characteristics all assessed at baseline (see S4 Appendix for complete list).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Eq 2, 1 will capture the unbiased treatment effect if the baseline control variables account for all observed and unobserved baseline differences between the treatment and control groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The estimates generated by Eq 2 represent our preferred estimates, as these estimates take into account the cluster-design of the study by controlling for blocking group, and they also represent the best attempt to adjust for differences present at baseline by including covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this regression model, we include the full set of baseline covariates in order to generate the most precise estimates possible and to control for any unmeasured source of confounding that could be correlated with measured observables [88,89].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we adjusted standard errors for site-level clustering using the Huber-White adjustment in Stata 15.0, and we used multiple imputation to account for all missing data on baseline covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For multiple imputation, we generated 25 multiply imputed datasets using the multivariate normal regression procedure in Stata 15.0 [90].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also present results from supplementary analyses described below, including estimates that were generated by regression models that adjusted for study attrition, and we provide a host of sensitivity checks in the supplementary information files to ensure that results were not generated due to idiosyncratic features of the statistical models we chose to adopt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_sharing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An anonymized version of the dataset used for the current paper has been made available at datadryad.org (INSERT FINAL WEBSITE URL HERE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data have been posted along with two additional files: 1) a readme explaining the variables contained within the dataset; 2) a file containing the Stata 15.0 syntax that was used to generate the results tables shown in the main text and supplementary material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Baseline_equivalence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We began by evaluating baseline equivalence on each measure collected at the beginning of preschool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Table 2, we present a selection of the pre-treatment measures available to provide a sense of the similarities and differences between the treatment and control groups at baseline, and in supplementary material (S3 Appendix), we provide the complete list of all baseline covariates included in our treatment impact models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the recommendations of CONSORT 2010 [see description by de Boer and colleagues, 89], we do not present p-values measuring differences between each individual characteristic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, we focus on describing the general pattern of differences between the groups, and the F-statistic in Table 2 provides an overall measure of the degree to which the groups differed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In general, we found that the groups were quite similar on most variables measuring demographic, parent, and home environment characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, measures of child baseline skills (e.g., executive functioning, math) tended to favor the treatment group, while measures of the preschool classroom environment (e.g., observed classroom quality) tended to favor the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reflecting these differences, the F-test indicated that across all characteristics assessed at baseline, the treatment and control group significantly differed (p less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although the treatment program was randomly assigned, the site-paired blocking procedure was still unable to ensure perfect balance on all observable characteristics assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was likely due to the relatively small number of clusters, and the high degree of variability between Head Start sites participating in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the supplementary file, we present selected site-level characteristics in S4 Appendix, which further illustrates the inter-site variation (e.g., the number of children enrolled for services at the site varied from 20 to 576).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Treatment_impacts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 3 contains descriptive information for the outcome variables used in the treatment impact analyses, including the mean, standard deviation, and range of each variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scores on the Hearts and Flowers measure reflect a moderate degree of accuracy on the mixed trials task, as students correctly completed approximately 66% of trials (ranging from 6% to 100% accuracy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean self-reported GPA across groups was 2.8, reflecting a C average, and scores on the internalizing and externalizing measures both indicated a moderate degree of behavioral problems, as students indicated engagement with internalizing behaviors on approximately 30% of the items presented, and indicated engagement with externalizing behaviors on approximately 52% of the items presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the EGNG descriptive information suggests that students had some difficulty in responding accurately to Angry and Sad trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recall that the D-Prime scores were standardized across all blocks for each student, and a D-Prime score of 0 would indicate that students had an equal proportion of errors and correct responses when viewing emotional faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across the Angry and Sad trials considered here, D-Prime ranged from -1.31 to 3.57, with average performance hovering around a mean of approximately 1.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As Table 3 reflects, we observed few mean differences between treatment and control across the unadjusted long-term follow-up measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the impact models described below show that treatment effects were detectable once adjustments for baseline differences were taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 4 presents our treatment impact estimates on the set of long-run outcomes, and all outcomes were standardized, so coefficients can be interpreted as effect sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Column 1, we present results from regression models that only included the blocking group fixed effects to adjust for the cluster-design of the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Column 2, we added all baseline covariates shown in S3 Appendix to adjust for differences observed between the groups at the time of random assignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing the unadjusted estimates shown in Column 1 to the estimates adjusted for baseline differences shown in Column 2, we can better understand how baseline differences between the treatment and control group might have affected the estimated treatment impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beginning with H&F, our measure of executive function, we predicted that assignment to the treatment group would positively affect performance on the H&F measure, and we found some support for this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With no covariates included, the treatment impact on H&F accuracy was positive, but not statistically significant (Ã = 0.14, SE = 0.08), but this effect grew larger when covariates were added, as our fully-controlled regression model indicated a marginally statistically significant effect of 0.18 (SE = 0.09, p = 0.08).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no indication of treatment and control differences on H&F reaction time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For self-reported GPA, we again predicted a positive treatment effect for the CSRP group, and we again found some support for this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With no adjustment for baseline differences, we found a treatment effect close to 0 on GPA (Ã = 0.06, SE = 0.90), but this effect grew to a statistically significant effect of 0.19 (SE = 0.09, p less_than 0.05) once baseline differences were taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because GPA is measured on an ordinal scale, we also investigated ordinal logistic regression models to ensure that our GPA effect was not sensitive to the assumptions of linear regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When controls were taken into account, we again found a statistically significant treatment impact (log-odds coefficient = 0.40, SE = 0.20, p less_than 0.05), and post-hoc marginal effects tests revealed that this impact was consistent throughout the GPA distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We predicted that the treatment would lower self-report scores on our measures of externalizing and internalizing, but our models largely failed to detect differences between the treatment and control groups on these measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When baseline differences were taken into account, we observed that adolescents in the treatment group had lower externalizing scores by about 1/10th of a SD, but this effect was far from statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we predicted that the treatment group would show a greater capacity for emotional regulation on the EGNG measure, but our findings suggested a more complex pattern of results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates that included adjustments for baseline differences produced statistically significant impacts on both measures of reaction time, as treatment students had lower adjusted reaction times when viewing angry (Ã = -0.32, SE = 0.08, p less_than 0.001) and sad (Ã = -0.24, SE = 0.08, p less_than 0.05) faces relative to neutral faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the treatment group may have exhibited heightened sensitivity to negative emotion, as students in the treatment group responded more quickly when faced with an emotionally expressive face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we also found negative, though not statistically significant, point estimates on both the Angry D-Prime and Sad D-Prime measures, indicating that the treatment group may have also had some difficulty with accuracy on the measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Supplemental_results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the following section, we describe results from alternative statistical models that were pursued in order to confirm the reliability of the results reported in Table 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We pursued these additional tests to examine whether our results were sensitive to statistical modelling decisions that could be viewed as arbitrary (e.g., using multiple imputation to adjust for missing data on baseline covariates instead of full information maximum likelihood) and to examine potential threats to the validity of our results due to study design shortcomings (e.g., attrition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results provide some promising, albeit inconclusive, evidence that a high-quality, early-childhood intervention targeting classroom quality and self-regulation could produce impacts detectable during adolescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the CSRP intervention would have positive long-run effects on measures of executive function and academic achievement, and we also expected the program to reduce behavioral problems and support emotional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across our models, we found positive impacts for children who participated in the CSRP program on measures of adolescent executive functioning and academic achievement, but these effects were only detected when covariates were included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found no evidence of long-run treatment effects on measures of problem behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These point in time findings stand in contrast to earlier findings of the impact of CSRP in supporting some students to shift to more positive behavioral trajectories during elementary school [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in result may be due to alternate analytic approaches, or due to developmental differences that occurred between elementary school and the period of adolescence considered here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with this open question, we also found that adolescents in the treatment group had heightened sensitivity to angry and sad emotional stimuli relative to the adolescents in CSRPs control group, and these differences in emotional regulation could lead to unobserved differences in behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When projecting what our results might mean for the current landscape of early interventions, it is important to recall the design of our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike other large-scale early intervention evaluations [22,26], our study did not compare students participation in a single ECE program versus non-participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, children assigned to the control group in our study were still enrolled in Head Start, meaning that our results inform policy conversations about models to improve Head Start rather than debates about the overall effectiveness of Head Start participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some respects, the fact that our study compared a Head Start improvement model versus business-as-usual Head Start constitutes a design strength, as many other ECE evaluations have struggled to accurately determine whether children in the control group sought alternative childcare arrangements or simply remained in relative care at home [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our study presents a clear comparison between two types of investment in the delivery of a single ECE program, but this comparison prevented us from testing whether Head Start produced long-lasting effects over alternative programs or informal early childcare arrangements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Instead, our results suggest that efforts to improve Head Start could produce potentially beneficial long-term effects for the children already receiving Head Start services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Head Start still constitutes the largest federal investment in ECE, yet much recent attention has shifted toward developing new, state and locally funded, preschool programs [e.g., New York City, Boston, etc.].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most recent preschool program models are more academic in focus, and they often operate inside pre-existing elementary schools, effectively adding an additional grade level prior to kindergarten.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rationale for scaling up academic preschool programs has been partly fueled by quasi-experimental evidence of the benefits of universal prekindergarten [92], correlational evidence showing the predictive importance of early academic skills [93], and because of the disappointing results of the Head Start Impact Study [94].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, policy advocates have also suggested that building new preschool programs from the ground up might be easier than trying to work within the existing structure of the Head Start system [95,17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, our results raise the possibility that improving Head Start, and working within the long-standing infrastructure, may be a worthwhile policy consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, the CSRP model could not be implemented at scale without some cost, as the intervention introduced 5 professional development sessions led by trained clinicians, and treatment teachers also received extensive access to masters level mental health consultants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While far from conclusive, our results suggest that such efforts may have led to long-term benefits for the cognitive functioning and academic achievement of low-income children facing a wide range of poverty-related stressors in their homes and neighborhoods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certainly, future work is needed to investigate whether these results hold throughout secondary school, but these initial long-term findings imply that researchers should consider cost-effective ways to improve Head Start when engaging in discussions regarding ECE program investment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We were somewhat surprised by our findings for the Emotional Go/ No Go (EGNG) task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, we found that children in the treatment group reacted more quickly (when adjusting for their baseline reaction time) in trials where they were asked to respond to angry and sad faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, we also found some indication that children may have had more difficulty with emotional regulation as we also observed negative D-Prime scores for children in the treatment group (though these effects were only statistically significant when using mean imputation to adjust for missing baseline data, see S6 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not hypothesize such a result, but taken with the reaction time findings, this implies that treated children were more alert and responsive to negative emotion as adolescents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that a response on a direct assessment administered via a computer task is not the same as maladaptive behavior, and we found no effects of the treatment on measures of behavioral problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When viewed alongside the impacts on executive function and academic achievement, these findings may simply indicate greater sensitivity to the presence of negative emotional stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive changes in cognitive ability may have also led to heightened vigilance to negative emotion, which may have particular salience for CSRP students navigation of peer and community contexts given this samples relatively high exposure to violence and crime in inner-city Chicago [96].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For discussions around the long-term effects of early intervention, our findings provide an important data point, though our results were somewhat mixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we found null effects on measures of behavior problems, indicating fadeout, though we found positive effects on measures of executive function and achievement, indicating some degree of treatment impact persistence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the positive effects estimated for EF and GPA were not large, as the EF effect was approximately 1/5th of a SD, and the GPA effect was similar in magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For GPA, this effect size suggests a change of approximately .10 grade units, which is small, but could be important for students who face longer odds than their more economically advantaged peers when applying to, attending and persisting in college [97].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that the treatment considered here was a relatively limited program, and given that children in the control condition still attended Head Start, it may be surprising that we observed any differences between the treatment and control groups 10 years after the program ended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, other recent intervention evaluations using quasi-experimental designs [19,98] have also found sustained effects on measures of educational attainment and achievement, but most of these studies investigated larger programs that were compared against counterfactual conditions that included no program exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clear that we need further work to continue investigating whether the CSRP program might have sustained effects on other important dimensions of attainment, such as high school graduation and college enrollment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work will be critical to fully understanding whether the modest gains in adolescent achievement and cognitive functioning could translate into key adult outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Limitations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study is not without limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, due to the developmental gap between the end-of-preschool period and the adolescent follow-up period, we could not collect the same measures in adolescence that were collected at the end of preschool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, end-of-preschool measures of academic achievement were simple counting and letter-naming tasks, whereas the adolescent measure of achievement was self-reported GPA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although self-reported GPA is likely to capture academic skills that developed from the basic school-readiness skills measured in preschool, it probably also captures the degree to which adolescents have adjusted to school and their perception of their own success in their school setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the EF measures from the two periods were linked as they both captured attention regulation and inhibitory control, but the H&F task was measured via a computerized assessment and it also took processing speed into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference was in part due to the reality that the early childhood assessment was conducted over 10 years ago, prior to the wide availability of standardized computer-based assessment tools that can be used across the lifespan such as the NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort [99].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this measurement limitation, our findings lend preliminary and promising support to the hypothesis that higher-order cognitive processes such as EF and academic achievement demonstrate continued plasticity to environmental enrichment provided early in childhood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As with other field experiments with a relatively small number of sites to be assigned (18 Head Start centers), we found evidence that the cluster-random assignment procedure did not successfully produce treatment and control groups that were balanced across all characteristics observed at baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This meant that our results were highly sensitive to the inclusion of covariates, and our treatment impacts for executive function and academic achievement were only present when adjustments for baseline imbalance were included in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our fully-controlled estimates adjusted for any observable differences between treatment and control groups that could have led to bias in our long-run treatment impact estimates, we cannot rule out whether unobserved differences also biased our effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, it should be noted that our estimated effects tended to become larger as covariates were added, rather than smaller, introducing the distinct possibility that our findings could represent lower-bound estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a possible unobserved source of confounding variation that would have driven our estimates in the opposite direction once included, but such possibilities are merely speculative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further, many of our results were imprecisely estimated, and standard errors differed between models with alternative specifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led many of our p-values to fall within the marginally statistically significant range [i.e., p less_than 0.10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these limitations warrant concern and should be considered when interpreting our results, such issues are not unique to our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the classic evaluation studies for Perry Preschool and ABC were both plagued by attrition and small sample sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study re-estimated the long-term treatment impacts for Perry and ABC and reported that most of the positive long-run results for both interventions were found at an alpha level of 0.10 when using a one-sided p-value test of statistical significance [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although our findings are merely suggestive rather than conclusive, this evidence still contributes to the existing literature base on the long-term effects of early intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
