Skeleton of an unusual, cat-sized marsupial relative (Metatheria: Marsupialiformes) from the middle Eocene (Lutetian: 44-43 million years ago) of Turkey  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We describe a near-complete, three-dimensionally preserved skeleton of a metatherian (relative of modern marsupials) from the middle Eocene (Lutetian: 4443 million years ago) Lülük member of the Uzunçardere Formation, central Turkey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an estimated body mass of 34 kg, about the size of a domestic cat (Felis catus) or spotted quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), it is an order of magnitude larger than the largest fossil metatherians previously known from the Cenozoic of the northern hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new taxon is characterised by large, broad third premolars that probably represent adaptations for hard object feeding (durophagy), and its craniodental morphology suggests the capacity to generate high bite forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitative and quantitative functional analyses of its postcranial skeleton indicate that it was probably scansorial and relatively agile, perhaps broadly similar in locomotor mode to the spotted quoll, but with a greater capacity for climbing and grasping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of a total evidence dataset comprising 259 morphological characters and 9kb of DNA sequence data from five nuclear protein-coding genes, using both undated and tip-and-node dating approaches, place the new taxon outside the marsupial crown-clade, but within the clade Marsupialiformes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It demonstrates that at least one metatherian lineage evolved to occupy the small-medium, meso- or hypo-carnivore niche in the northern hemisphere during the early Cenozoic, at a time when there were numerous eutherians (placentals and their fossil relatives) filling similar niches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the known mammal fauna from Uzunçardere Formation appears highly endemic, and geological evidence suggests that this region of Turkey was an island for at least part of the early Cenozoic, and so the new taxon may have evolved in isolation from potential eutherian competitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the new taxon reveals previously unsuspected ecomorphological disparity among northern hemisphere metatherians during the first half of the Cenozoic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Current fossil evidence indicates that the mammalian clades Metatheria (= Marsupialia plus all fossil taxa more closely related to marsupials than to placentals) and Eutheria (= Placentalia plus all fossil taxa more closely related to placentals than to marsupials) probably diverged at least 160 million years ago (MYA) [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This date is broadly congruent with recent molecular clock estimates for the timing of the split between marsupials and placentals [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the Mesozoic, metatherians and eutherians were moderately diverse taxonomically [6], but they were restricted to relatively small body sizes (less_than7 kg) and exhibited limited ecomorphological disparity [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metatherians seem to have been affected much more severely than eutherians by the K-Pg mass extinction event [79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the Palaeocene onwards, eutherians (including placentals) radiated massively, going on to dominate mammalian faunas in most of the world, in terms of both number of species and ecomorphological disparity [10, 11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metatherians dispersed to South America in the latest Cretaceous or early Palaeocene [1214], and they diversified widely in South America, Antarctica and Australia during the Cenozoic [12, 1419].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the northern hemisphere, by contrast, the Cenozoic fossil record of Metatheria is characterised by low species diversity and very limited ecomorphological disparity, with northern hemisphere metatherians eventually going extinct during the middle Miocene [10, 20, 21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single didelphid marsupial, the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), is currently widespread in North America, the result of dispersal from South America within the last one million years [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, besides the Virginia opossum and a few other didelphid species that occur in Central America, marsupials are now entirely absent from the northern hemisphere (except for a handful of human introductions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparative lack of evolutionary success of metatherians in the northern hemisphere during the Cenozoic has often been argued to be because they are competitively inferior to eutherians [23, 24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we describe a three-dimensionally preserved partial skull and near complete postcranial skeleton of a new metatherian from the middle Eocene (Lutetian) Uzunçardere Formation in central Turkey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only is it remarkably well-preserved, it also reveals previously unsuspected ecomorphological disparity among northern hemisphere metatherians during the Cenozoic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present qualitative and quantitative functional analyses of its craniodental and postcranial morphology, and we test its evolutionary relationships via Bayesian undated and tip-and-node dating phylogenetic analyses of a total evidence dataset comprising 259 morphological characters and 9kb of DNA sequence data from five nuclear protein-coding genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we discuss the significance of this taxon for understanding the relative success of eutherians and metatherians in the northern hemisphere during the Cenozoic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Description of the dentition of AÜJM 200225 follows standard terminology for tribosphenic metatherians [6, 2730].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Description of the cranium draws on a range of studies of metatherian cranial anatomy [27, 3139].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Description of the postcranium follows studies of metatherians [32, 3956] and of other therian mammals [5762].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Body_mass_estimate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dentition of AÜJM 200225, with its steep molar size gradient in which m4 is much larger than m1, is unlike that of any living marsupial; thus, we have chosen not to estimate body mass using tooth size [6365].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we estimated body mass based on total jaw length using the dasyuromorphian dataset of Myers [65], because dasyuromorphians (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dasyurus spp., Sarcophilus harrisii) appear to represent reasonable ecomorphological analogues for AÜJM 200225.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regression equation calculated by Myers [65] is log10(body mass) = 2.722 + (3.207* log10[total jaw length]), with a smearing estimate of 2.3% and a percentage error of 18%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both mandibles are slightly damaged anteriorly in AÜJM 200225 (the left mandible is slightly more complete, and so was used to measure total jaw length), and so the body mass estimate using this equation is likely to be a slight underestimate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Qualitative_morphofunctional_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Qualitative functional analysis of the dentition follows Muizon and Lange-Badré [66], whilst that of the skeleton follows multiple studies [32, 39, 41, 4345, 4749, 5155, 5762].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_morphofunctional_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Zimicz [67, 68] presented five dental indices, modified from previous work by Van Valkenburgh [69], that can be used to quantitatively compare tooth shape in carnivorous metatherians, namely: Relative Grinding Area (RGA) = square root of the area of the talonid of m4/length of m4; Relative Premolar Size (RPS) = width of the largest lower premolar/cube root of body mass in kg; Premolar Shape (PS) = width of the largest lower premolar/length of largest lower premolar; Relative Premolar Length (RPL) = length of largest lower premolar/length of m4; Relative Blade Length (RBL) or Trigonid Length of the Carnassial Molar (TLC) = length of the trigonid of m4/total length of m4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These indices were calculated for AÜJM 200225 and compared with 31 other similarly-sized (less_than10 kg), carnivorously-adapted metatherians (both modern and fossil), based on either published data or our own measurements of specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Body mass estimates for modern taxa are from the PanTHERIA database [70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Body mass estimates for fossil taxa were taken from the literature, or were calculated using published predictive regression equations based on dental measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Values for individual indices calculated for AÜJM 200225 were compared to the critical values presented by Zimicz [67, 68], which are as follows: for RGA, less_than0.5 = hypercarnivore, 0.50.8 = mesocarnivore,  greater than 0.8 = hypocarnivore; for PS,  greater than 0.58 = bone-cracker (or other durophage), less_than0.58 = non-bone-cracker; for RPS,  greater than 2.6 = bone-cracker (or other durophage), less_than2.6 = non-bone-cracker; for RPL,  greater than 0.7 = hypercarnivore, less_than0.7 = mesocarnivore or hypocarnivore; for RBL/TLC,  greater than 0.9 = hypercarnivore, 0.80.9 = bone-cracker (or other durophage), 0.70.8 = mesocarnivore, less_than0.7 = hypocarnivore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values of RGA, RPS, PS, RPL and RBL were also subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) in PAST 3.07 [71] to determine where AÜJM 200225 and other carnivorously-adapted metatherians fall in dental morphospace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the indices are all dimensionless ratios, the analysis used the variance-covariance matrix, rather than the correlation matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cranium of AÜJM 200225 is too incomplete to allow calculation of bite force using the dry skull method [72, 73].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we used the method of Therrien [74], as modified for metatherians by Wilson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [75], to calculate relative bite force based on measurements of the mandible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the dorsoventral radius of the mandible in medial view rather than lateral view (as was done by Therrien [74]), because the molar crowns extend much further ventrally (and the roots are partially exposed) in lateral view than in medial view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chen and Wilson [76] identified 30 postcranial indices that collectively perform well at correctly identifying locomotor mode of extant small-bodied mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, 24 can be calculated for AÜJM 200225.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We added AÜJM 200225 to the five-locomotor-mode dataset of Chen and Wilson [76], which comprises 87 modern mammals of known locomotor mode, namely either Arboreal, Scansorial, Semiaquatic, Semifossorial and Terrestrial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 24 indices for this combined taxon set were then subjected to phylogenetically flexible discriminant analysis [77, 78] using a modified version of an R script written by L. Schmitz (available here: https://github.com/lschmitz/phylo.fda), using the phylogeny and divergence times of Bininda-Emonds et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [79] for relationships among the modern taxa, and assuming equal prior probabilities for the five locomotor modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the evolutionary relationships of the new taxon, we added it to a modified version of the total evidence dataset of Beck et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [80]; this includes 33 metatherian terminals, including representatives of all modern marsupial orders, plus key fossil metatherian taxa known from well-preserved craniodental and/or postcranial material, namely Asiatherium, Deltatheridium, Pucadelphys, Mayulestes, Andinodelphys, Herpetotherium, Djarthia and a composite Peradectidae terminal that combines character scores from Peradectes and Mimoperadectes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dataset comprises 259 morphological characters (of which 27 [= 10.4%] are dental, 78 [= 30.1%] are cranial, 146 [= 56.4%] are postcranial and 8 [= 3.1%] are soft tissue) and 9012 base pairs of sequence data from five nuclear protein-coding genes (APOB, BRCA1, IRBP, RAG1 and VWF; see Beck et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [37, 80] for full details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also added the Late Cretaceous stagodontid Didelphodon vorax, which shows some dental similarities to taxon described here, with character scores based on the description of Wilson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [75] and on isolated tarsals from Dinosaur Park in Canada that were tentatively referred to Didelphodon by Szalay [56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new taxon could be scored for 98 morphological characters (= 37.8%), of which 19 are dental, 13 are cranial, and 66 are postcranial, whilst Didelphodon could be scored for 73 (= 28.2%), of which 24 are dental, 35 are cranial, and 14 are postcranial; character scores for Anatoliadelphys and Didelphodon are given in S2 Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in Beck et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [37, 80], 49 characters representing plausible morphoclines were specified as ordered (see S2 Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enigmatic fossil Australian marsupial Yalkaparidon [37] was deleted, as preliminary analyses indicated that its phylogenetic position was highly unstable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final taxon set comprised 34 fossil and modern metatherian terminals, plus five non-metatherian outgroup terminals (the extant monotremes Ornithorhynchus and Tachyglossus, the fossil stem-therian Vincelestes, and the fossil eutherians Asioryctes and Ukhaatherium).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The resultant total evidence matrix (available for download as S1 File) was analysed using Bayesian undated and tip-and-node dating analysis in MrBayes 3.2.6 [81], following the general approach of Beck et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [37, 80].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, an appropriate partitioning scheme and set of models was determined for the sequence data using PartitionFinder v1.0.1 [82], using the Bayesian Information Criterion, linked branch lengths and the greedy search algorithm, whilst the morphological data was assigned a single Mk model [83], assuming that only parsimony-informative characters had been scored and with a gamma distribution to model rate heterogeneity between sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the tip-and-node dating analysis, temporal information was incorporated via ages for the terminals (taken from the literature; assumed age ranges for terminals are listed in S3 Text) and offset-exponential age priors on selected nodes [8487].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single Independent Gamma Rates (IGR) clock model [84] and a Fossilised Birth-Death (FBD) tree prior that assumed diversity sampling [86] were implemented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our taxon set was at the level of genera, we assumed that the sampling probability of our modern taxa was 0.25 (= 23 out of a total of 93 currently recognised genera).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the undated and dated analyses were run 20x106 generations, sampling every 5x103 generations, with each analysis comprising four independent runs of four chains (three heated, one cold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An appropriate burn-in period was determined using Tracer v1.6 [88].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The post-burn-in trees from the undated analysis were summarised using 50% majority rule consensus in MrBayes, whereas those from the dated analysis were summarised as a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree using TreeAnnotator v1.8.3, after first converting branch lengths from substitutions per site to millions of years using the perl script burntrees.pl (available here: https://github.com/nylander/Burntrees).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Support was assessed using Bayesian posterior probabilities for both analyses, and divergence times from the dated analysis were calculated as median heights (with 95% highest posterior densities used as confidence intervals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The morphological characters were then mapped onto the undated and dated phylogenies to identify unambiguous synapomorphies (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  character state changes that are synapomorphies under both Accelerated Transformation [ACCTRAN] and Delayed Transformation [DELTRAN]) using PAUP* 4.0a152, assuming the maximum parsimony criterion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Body_mass_estimate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total length of the intact part of the left mandible of AÜJM 200225 is 88.2 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the total jaw length regression equation of Myers [65] for his dasyuromorphian dataset and taking into account the smearing estimate gives a body mass estimate of 3.37 kg for AÜJM 200225, with a range of 2.763.97 kg when the percentage error is taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the left mandible is slightly damaged anteriorly, this is undoubtedly a slight underestimate, and so a body mass of 34 kg (similar to a typical domestic cat, or a male spotted quoll [Dasyurus maculatus]) seems probable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Morphofunctional_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_relationships_of_Anatoliadelphys  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several metatherians show broadly similar craniodental adaptations to Anatoliadelphys, namely enlarged upper and lower third premolars and features associated with the generation of high bite forces; these include the Late Cretaceous North American stagodontids [29, 75, 101, 142, 145147], Eobrasilia coutoi, Didelphopsis cabrerai and Gaylordia macrocynodonta from the early Eocene Itaboraí fauna of Brazil [166172], various South American Cenozoic sparassodonts [148], the probable dasyuromorphian Malleodectes from the Miocene of Australia [150, 151], and the extant dasyurid Sarcophilus harrisii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitative analysis of available data suggests that these similarities are most likely homoplastic, as discussed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anatoliadelphys lacks the tall paraconid and high, bladelike paracristid with a keyhole-like carnassial notch characteristic of stagodontid lower molars, and there are major differences in the structure of the upper molars, with stagodontids having a straight centrocrista on M3 (strongly v-shaped in Anatoliadelphys, with the premetacrista contacting stylar cusp D) and well-developed conules (absent or indistinct in Anatoliadelphys) [66, 101, 147].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated tarsals tentatively referred to the stagodontids Eodelphis and Didelphodon by Szalay [56] are highly distinctive, and exhibit a number of probable apomorphies absent in Anatoliadelphys, including a circular calcaneocuboid facet, and a distally-placed and obliquely-oriented sustentacular facet [56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eobrasilia is too poorly known to be meaningfully compared with Anatoliadelphys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An isolated right upper molar (DGM 896-M(a), an M2 or M3) was tentatively referred to E. coutoi by Marshall [167], but was subsequently referred by him to a separate taxon, Zeusdelphys complicatus [168, 169].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, DGM 896-M(a) differs markedly from the upper molars of Anatoliadelphys: in DGM 896-M(a), StB and StD are both very large and subequal in height (StD is much larger than StB in Anatoliadelphys), and the enamel is heavily wrinkled, unlike in Anatoliadelphys, and it further differs from Anatoliadelphys in lacking distinct cingula anterior and posterior to the protocone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Didelphopsis cabrerai and Gaylordia macrocynodonta, meanwhile, lacks the strong posterior increase in molar size, enormous protoconid and very reduced paraconid and metaconid of Anatoliadelphys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Didelphopsis cabrerai and a second, less specialised Gaylordia species from Itaboraí, G. mater are characterised by a weakly v-shaped centrocrista on M3 (strongly v-shaped in Anatoliadelphys, with the premetacrista contacting stylar cusp D), and a prominent stylar cusp C (absent in Anatoliadelphys), and they lack prominent pre- and post-cingula [168172].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the upper molars of sparassodonts, the centrocrista (where not lost through fusion of the paracone and metacone) is straight on all upper molars, unlike the strongly v-shaped centrocrista of the M3 of Anatoliadelphys, pre- and post-cingula are absent, and the protocone is often reduced, whilst in the lower molars, the paraconid is consistently well-developed in sparassodonts [32, 66]; there are also major differences in tarsal structure between sparassodonts and Anatoliadelphys [56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, Anatoliadelphys shares with most dasyuromorphians (including the durophagously-adapted Malleodectes [151]) the presence of a StD that is distinctly larger than StB on M3, but it lacks the characteristic australidelphian apomorphies seen in the tarsus of dasyuromorphians, most obviously the fusion of the ectal and sustentacular facets (the continuous lower ankle joint pattern) [56, 125, 164].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, although Anatoliadelphys shares some derived craniodental features with a wide range of metatherians, it is likely that most (if not all) are convergent, reflecting the functional demands of a durophagous diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broadly similar adaptations have also evolved multiple times in eutherians, for example in the condylarth Periptychus [10] and the apternodontid insectivore Apternodus [173].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This qualitative interpretation is supported by the results of our Bayesian undated and tip-and-node dating analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the both analyses, Anatoliadelphys falls within Marsupialiformes but outside Marsupialia, and it does not form a clade with Didelphodon or with the possible sparassodont Mayulestes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the undated analysis, Anatoliadelphys is part of a trichotomy that also includes Peradectidae and a clade that includes Marsupialia, Didelphodon, Herpetotherium and Asiatherium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the dated analysis, Anatoliadelphys forms a clade with Peradectidae, which receives moderate support (Bayesian posterior probability = 0.77), whilst Didelphodon is again closer to Marsupialia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, our phylogenetic results are broadly similar to other recent analyses [37, 75, 80, 103, 148, 174, 175], although some relationships within Marsupialiformes remain to be confidently resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, our analyses recovered relationships within Marsupialia that are congruent with recent molecular studies [5, 176178], in contrast to the phylogenetic analysis of Wilson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [75], which failed to recover monophyly of Australidelphia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unambigous synapomorphies for Metatheria, Marsupialiformes, Marsupialia and (for the dated analysis) Anatoliadelphys+Peradectidae are given in Table 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the undated analysis, loss of the posterior cingulid optimises as an unambiguous synapomorphy of Marsupialia (secondarily reversed in dasyuromorphians), as previously proposed by Voss and Jansa [27]; Anatoliadelphys retains a very faint posterior cingulid on m3 and m4, supporting a position outside Marsupialia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the dated analysis, meanwhile, the sole unambiguous synapomorphy of Marsupialia is subdivision of the calcaneocuboid facet of the calcaneus into three distinct facets; this morphology is present in australidelphians and paucituberculatans, whilst didelphids have distinct distal and proximal calcaneocuboid facets, and that of Herpetotherium also appears to be subdivided into two distinct facets (one laterodorsal and one medioventral [49, 56, 119, 125, 164, 179]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simple, concave calcaneocuboid facet of Anatoliadelphys is congruent with a position outside Marsupialia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A full list of morphological synapomorphies for all clades present in our undated and dated analyses, under both Accelerated Transformation (ACCTRAN) and Delayed Transformation (DELTRAN), is given in S4 Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dated analysis resulted in divergence dates that are broadly congruent with recent molecular studies [5], with the first divergence within Marsupialia estimated at 68.2 MYA (95% HPD: 60.775.2 MYA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anatoliadelphys was estimated as having diverged from Peradectidae 59.0 MYA (95% HPD 54.472.4 MYA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Anatoliadelphys maasae is its large size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an estimated body mass of 34 kg, it is one of the largest metatherians known from the northern hemisphere, together with two North American species, namely the extant Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana; mean body mass 2.4 kg [70]), and the Late Cretaceous stagodontid Didelphodon vorax (estimated body mass 2.16.2 kg [75]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of D. virginiana (which dispersed to North America from South America less_than1 million years ago [22]), the largest Cenozoic metatherians previously known from the northern hemisphere were the early Eocene North American peradectids Mimoperadectes labrus and M. houdei [20, 180]), which probably weighed ~250g, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  an order of magnitude smaller than Anatoliadelphys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anatoliadelphys is also unusual in exhibiting obvious craniodental adaptations for carnivory (probably meso- or hypocarnivory, rather than hypercarnivory) and durophagy (perhaps for crushing bone, hard shelled invertebrates, or both).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cretaceous northern hemisphere deltatheroidans and stagodontids were carnivorously adapted [6, 7, 9, 66], and the large, broad premolars of stagodontids also suggest durophagy [6, 29, 101, 145, 181].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous carnivorous and durophagous metatherians are also known from the Cenozoic of South America and Australia [12, 15, 17, 32, 104, 148, 151, 182, 183].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, prior to the discovery of Anatoliadelphys, all known Cenozoic fossil metatherians from the northern hemisphere were characterised by relatively generalised tribosphenic molars and unspecialised premolars [20, 21, 28, 184], suggesting that they were primarily insectivorous (although some peradectids may have been at least partially frugivorous [95]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anatoliadelphys therefore reveals previously unsuspected ecomorphological diversity among northern hemisphere metatherians during the Cenozoic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anatoliadelphys demonstrates that at least one metatherian lineage evolved to successfully occupy a small-medium meso- or hypocarnivore niche in the northern hemisphere during the early Palaeogene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous carnivorous fossil eutherians are known from the northern hemisphere during this time period, including carnivoromorphians, mesonychians, pantolestids, didymoconids, and oxyaenid and hyaenodontid creodonts [10, 185].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyaenodontids are also known from the early Palaeogene of Africa, where they likely originated [186].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these carnivorous eutherians were similar in size (110 kg) to Anatoliadelphys, and so represent potential ecological competitors [185].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, although still poorly known, the UCF mammal fauna appears to be highly endemic (Table 7), and carnivorous eutherians have yet to be found there.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted by Metais et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [94], the presence of multiple species of the pleuraspidotheriid Hilalia in the Lutetian (4443 MYA) UCF mammal fauna is particularly striking: the youngest record of Pleuraspidotheriidae from Europe is latest Palaeocene, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1214 million years older [189].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This anachronistic presence of pleuraspidotheriids suggests that the UCF may preserve a mammal fauna that evolved largely in isolation during the early Cenozoic, with only limited biogeographical connectivity to Laurasia and Africa [89, 94].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is congruent with geological evidence that this region of Turkey was an island for at least part of the early Cenozoic [188, 190].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If Anatoliadelphys evolved as part of an isolated mammalian fauna in which carnivorous eutherians were absent, then it may in fact provide further support for the hypothesis that metatherians are competitively inferior to eutherians, due to differences in traits relating to reproductive mode and associated developmental constraints, and/or differences in metabolic rate [23, 191195].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation is reinforced by the apparent absence of mainland Laurasian metatherians that show similar specialisations to Anatoliadelphys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
