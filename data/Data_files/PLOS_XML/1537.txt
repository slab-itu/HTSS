ANK1 is up-regulated in laser captured microglia in Alzheimers brain; the importance of addressing cellular heterogeneity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent epigenetic association studies have identified a new gene, ANK1, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although strong associations were observed, brain homogenates were used to generate the data, introducing complications because of the range of cell types analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to address the issue of cellular heterogeneity in homogenate samples we isolated microglial, astrocytes and neurons by laser capture microdissection from CA1 of hippocampus in the same individuals with a clinical and pathological diagnosis of AD and matched control cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this unique RNAseq data set, we show that in the hippocampus, ANK1 is significantly (pless_than0.0001) up-regulated 4-fold in AD microglia, but not in neurons or astrocytes from the same individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data provide evidence that microglia are the source of ANK1 differential expression previously identified in homogenate samples in AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alzheimers disease (AD) is a multi-factorial neurological disorder classically characterized by amyloid plaques[1] and neurofibrillary tangles[2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AD also features many signs of chronic inflammation[3, 4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microglia, resident immune cells within the central nervous system, are key regulators of the inflammatory cascade[5], which has been proposed as an early event in AD[6, 7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been known for decades that microglia have the ability to release neuro-toxic inflammatory factors, which have prompted hundreds of studies to address a causal mechanism[8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although may genetic association studies have identified potential glial-associated alterations (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TREM2) [9], none have been absolute in predicting disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have reached beyond genetic variation, but instead looked towards epigenetic changes as a mechanism by which environment can interact with genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As such, recent epigenetic-wide association studies (EWAS) have identified a class of genes associated with AD risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ankyrin repeat domain-containing proteins are plasma bound membrane proteins, which modulate interactions between cytoskeletal and membrane proteins[10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A specific ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein, ANK1, has been a source of great interest in the field of AD[1113] and type 2 diabetes[14, 15], a recognized risk factor for AD[16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two independent EWAS have identified methylation changes in the ANK1 gene that are associated with AD[11, 12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies indicate that epigenetic mechanisms (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA methylation) and the rise of age-dependent inflammatory conditions are major risk factors for AD, and ANK1 may be the link between the two[12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these studies which draw attention to ANK1 as a potentially critical molecule in the pathophysiology of AD were conducted on homogenates brain samples, which leaves unresolved the identity of the cells impacted by DNA hypermethylation in AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we provide evidence that microglia are the source of ANK1 differential expression in the AD brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Current data shows a strong significant hypermethylation of ANK1 in AD cortex [11, 12], however no data exist on which classes of cell(s) are associated with these changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to connect the observed changes in ANK1 to a specific cell type, we mined our previously published homogenate mRNA data [19, 20], and compared these findings to RNA sequencing data we generated from microglia, astrocytes and neurons from the same subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to parallel previously published EWAS studies, ANK1 mRNA expression was initially investigated in homogenate samples derived from human hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant difference in ANK1 expression was detected between AD and control samples (p = .323) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the limbic (studied here) and sub-cortical regions (studied in EWAS) may be different in terms of ANK1 expression, that the number of cells analyzed in homogenates is too large to detect subtle differences in single cell populations, splice variants, or that separate cell populations may demonstrate overlapping and wide variance in ANK1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to address the effect of cellular heterogeneity, data from laser-captured microglia, astrocytes and neurons were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogous to homogenate samples, no significant difference in ANK1 expression was found between control neurons and AD neurons (p greater than .1), or control astrocytes and AD astrocytes (p greater than .1) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In stark contrast, AD microglia from the same individuals, in the same brain region revealed a significant (pless_than0.01) 4.1-fold increase in ANK1 expression compared to microglia isolated from control brain samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitation of these findings were replicated using real-time PCR (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the insignificant change in homogenates between AD and control brain concealed highly significant alterations in ANK1 expression in microglia in AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that neuronal cells express higher ANK1 levels compared to microglial samples (Base-Mean 9 vs. 2 respectively) may indicate that the ANK1 gene may have a significant role in neuronal function although no disease associations can be made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings show that expression profiling of laser captured cells is required to clarify data from homogenate studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to determine disease specificity, laser captured CA1 microglia from Parkinsons cases were also analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar differential expression patterns were identified in PD microglia for two of the eight genes analyzed (ANK1, and ANKLE2) (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that unlike homogenate and LCM neurons, ANK1 is significantly up-regulated in both AD and PD microglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that alterations in ANK1, at least in microglia, may not be disease specific, but rather a response, or phenotype associated with neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when other brain regions were analyzed (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  substantia nigra), PD microglia showed a significant 2-fold increase in ANK1 expression (S1 Table), providing further evidence for the notion that ANK1 may be involved in, or associated with, the process of neurodegeneration, more specifically, neuroinflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_ankyrin_repeat-domain_genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to determine if other genes containing ankyrin repeat domains were selectively affected by disease, we analyzed all the significantly altered ANK1-like genes in homogenates, LCM neurons, astrocytes and microglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differential_expression_analysis_in_EWAS_related_genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the differential methylation changes in the ANK1 gene in AD [11], recent EWAS studies also identified a number of other loci as being differentially methylated in disease (ABCA7, BIN1, CDH23, DIP2A, RHBDF2, RPL13, RNF34, SERPINF1 and SERPINF2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the nine genes identified by De Jager and colleagues, six were also identified in LCM CA1 neurons (CDH23, RPL13, RNF34, SERPINF1, ABCA7, and SERPINF1), but only one was found to be significantly differentially expressed Bin 1 (p = less_than0.021), (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In microglia, one gene, SERPINF2, had a significant (p = less_than0.001) increase in expression in AD (p = less_than0.001) compared to control (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This same gene was not differentially expressed in AD homogenates or AD neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that homogenates are inadequate predictors of global gene expression changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, homogenate samples appear to mask important changes in single cell classes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent studies of human brain homogenates have identified hypermethylation of the ANK1 gene in Alzheimers disease[11, 12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, the interpretation of these data is obscured since brain homogenates produce data that result from many different classes of cells in many different disease states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These authors (DeJager et al., 2014; Lunnon 2014) acknowledge this issue in their homogenate data, but speculate that their ANK1 findings may be related to activation of microglia through association with PTK2B, a gene that is associated with many microglial processes[2128].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to address the issue of cellular heterogeneity, we isolated microglial, astrocytes, and neurons in the same individuals by laser capture microdissection from CA1 of hippocampus in AD, and in normal control cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these data sets, we determined that ANK1 expression is up-regulated 4-fold in AD microglia, but not in pyramidal neurons or astrocytes from the same individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We note that, although the conventional association between DNA methylation and gene expression is that hypermethylation is repressive, we found increased expression in ANK1 the gene that prior studies found to be hypermethylated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that this apparent inconsistency may be attributable to the location (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  intragenic regions) identified in the EWAS study, however other explanations are possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the data generated in EWAS studies was derived from bisulfite-treated DNA, therefore the signal is the sum of DNA methylation marks including hypermethylation, which may have different effects on transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, recent studies have shown that an increase in methylation within intragenic regions results in an increase in gene expression and gene activation[2931].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lack of altered ANK1 expression in hippocampal homogenates compared to findings of increased DNA methylation in other studies[11, 12] may be attributed to several factors: 1) the different brain regions studied, for example neocortical vs. limbic in our data; 2) the complexities of the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression; 3) dilution effects of homogenates and 4) differential splicing of the gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the lack of altered ANK1 expression in hippocampal homogenates in our data, compared to our finding of increased expression of ANK1 in microglia from a hippocampal sub-region, may be attributed to dilution effects of homogenates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These data show that unlike homogenate and LCM neurons, ANK1 is significantly up-regulated in both AD and PD microglia, suggesting that alterations in ANK1, at least in microglia, may not be disease specific, but rather a response to a common pathway affected in neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  inflammation, or oxidative stress).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of increased expression of ANK1 in Alzheimers microglia remains to be determined; but more importantly, these findings emphasize that expression profiling of defined classes of cells is required to clarify data from homogenate studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
