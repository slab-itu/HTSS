Implications of Harvest on the Boundaries of Protected Areas for Large Carnivore Viewing Opportunities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The desire to see free ranging large carnivores in their natural habitat is a driver of tourism in protected areas around the globe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, large carnivores are wide-ranging and subject to human-caused mortality outside protected area boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of harvest (trapping or hunting) on wildlife viewing opportunities has been the subject of intense debate and speculation, but quantitative analyses have been lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the effect of legal harvest of wolves (Canis lupus) along the boundaries of two North American National Parks, Denali (DNPP) and Yellowstone (YNP), on wolf viewing opportunities within the parks during peak tourist season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used data on wolf sightings, pack sizes, den site locations, and harvest adjacent to DNPP from 19972013 and YNP from 20082013 to evaluate the relationship between harvest and wolf viewing opportunities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although sightings were largely driven by wolf population size and proximity of den sites to roads, sightings in both parks were significantly reduced by harvest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sightings in YNP increased by 45% following years with no harvest of a wolf from a pack, and sightings in DNPP were more than twice as likely during a period with a harvest buffer zone than in years without the buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings show that harvest of wolves adjacent to protected areas can reduce sightings within those areas despite minimal impacts on the size of protected wolf populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consumptive use of carnivores adjacent to protected areas may therefore reduce their potential for non-consumptive use, and these tradeoffs should be considered when developing regional wildlife management policies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Large carnivore conservation relies heavily on sustaining populations within protected areas [1], and protection within these regions provides the majority of viewing opportunities for these species [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The desire to see iconic, free ranging large carnivores is a driver for wildlife tourism around the globe and may improve acceptability of their presence by the general public and contribute to conservation goals ([3] but see [4]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, large predators are wide-ranging and seldom confined within the boundaries of protected areas, creating difficult transboundary management issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outside and even inside of protected areas, conflict with humans is the single most important cause of mortality for large carnivores [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet the link between human-caused mortality of carnivores adjacent to protected areas and viewing opportunities within a protected region has not been evaluated quantitatively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In North America, gray wolves (Canis lupus) are emblematic of management issues occurring at the borders of protected areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protection of wolves in National Parks, such as Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and Denali National Park and Preserve (DNPP), provides the opportunity for thousands of visitors to see wolves each year, but these wide-ranging carnivores often travel across park boundaries onto other public or private lands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mortality of individual wolves from frequently viewed packs due to hunting or trapping outside these parks has sparked widespread controversy and prompted concern regarding the impact of these losses on population and pack dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although harvest (hunting or trapping) occurring outside park boundaries may not have population-level effects, harvest of particular individuals can lead to the decline or dissolution of entire packs [8,9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the packs or individuals most susceptible to harvest are those that provide the majority of viewing opportunities to visitors of protected areas, then harvest may influence wolf sightings even if harvest levels are too low to reduce population size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar impacts of harvest may affect carnivore sightings in other regions as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Africa, for example, the desire to see lions (Panthera leo) and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) in their natural habitat is the main reason tourists visit the continents reserves, but these species are also the most vulnerable to threats such as human hunting adjacent to reserves [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main objective of this study was to assess effects of harvest adjacent to protected areas on wildlife sightings, using wolves in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and Denali National Park and Preserve (DNPP) as a case study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Agencies responsible for managing protected areas often have mandates to provide opportunities for visitor enjoyment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the United States, the National Park Service is mandated to provide opportunities for visitor enjoyment of which wildlife viewing is an important component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viewing large carnivores, particularly wolves and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), is cited by visitors as one of the main reasons they come to YNP [11] and is a main indicator of a satisfying visitor experience in DNPP [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, in Alaska where wolves are among the most desired species for viewing [13], state wildlife management includes mandates to provide for multiple uses, including non-consumptive uses such as wildlife viewing [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Montana, wildlife watching is listed by visitors and state residents as one of the primary activities in the state [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wildlife viewing also brings an important socio-economic benefit to the states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wolf watching activities in YNP following the reintroduction of wolves in 1995 brings an estimated $35 million annually to the states of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wildlife viewing is a driver of tourism for DNPP [16] and the state of Alaska [15,17] and wildlife viewing activities in Alaska supported over $2.7 billion dollars in economic activity in 2011 [17].At the same time, states are also mandated to provide for consumptive uses of wildlife, and harvest of wolves can provide significant economic benefits as well [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2011, statewide revenue in Montana from the purchase of wolf tags alone was over $400,000 [19] while hunting in Alaska supported over $1.3 billion dollars in economic activity [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As part of the delisting process for gray wolves in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, each state has developed wolf management plans that include wolf hunting seasons (for details on state management: www.westerngraywolf.fws.gov), prompting concern that hunting may impact wolf viewing opportunities in YNP [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In DNPP, a buffer zone prohibiting the trapping and hunting of wolves was established in key regions bordering DNPP from 2000 to 2010 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The buffer was abolished in March 2010 and viewing rates in DNPP subsequently declined [21], raising concerns that harvest of wolves near park boundaries might have been responsible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To examine the effect of harvest on wolf sightings, we first examined levels of wolf harvest adjacent to each park and the composition of harvested wolves to determine whether breeding and collared wolves were more or less susceptible to harvest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concurrent analyses showed that breeding wolves were more likely to be near the Denali Park Road than non-breeding wolves [22], indicating that breeding wolves may contribute disproportionately to sightings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we anticipated that less experienced (younger, non-breeding) wolves would be more likely to be harvested than the generally more experienced breeding wolves ([22], but see [2325]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this was the case, we expected that harvested wolves may be relatively unimportant to sightings, thereby reducing the potential effect of harvest on viewing opportunities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in YNP, the presence of radio-collars on wolves, regardless of breeding status, may increase sighting opportunities for visitors because NPS staff routinely scans for signals from collared animals to assist in locating and viewing wolves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, if there was disproportional harvest of collared wolves (regardless of breeding status), harvest could decrease viewing opportunities, especially in YNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed data on wolf sightings, pack sizes, den site locations, and harvest adjacent to DNPP from 19972013 and YNP from 20082013 to evaluate the relationship between harvest of wolves and wolf viewing opportunities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that changes in wolf population size and den site proximity to park roads are the main drivers of wolf sightings and that additionally, the presence of harvest (or absence of the harvest buffer) would reduce wolf sightings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, changes in wolf population size and den site proximity to park roads could be the main drivers of wolf sightings, and harvest could have comparably negligible effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_areas  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study area encompassed two national parks in North America (Fig 1, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNPP study area encompassed 6,350 km2 of the eastern region of the park and adjacent areas north of the Alaska Range (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevation ranges from 1503,000 m and contains habitat patches of boreal forest, high alpine, braided rivers, and willow-lined creeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diversity of habitat types supports populations of caribou (Rangifer tarandus), Dalls sheep (Ovis dalli), and moose (Alces alces) which constitute the main prey base for wolves in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The YNP study area encompassed approximately 1,000 km2 of the Northern Range within and adjacent to the park (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevation ranges from 1,5002,400 m, with lower elevations characterized by large open meadows and shrub steppe vegetation and higher elevations characterized by coniferous forests [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elk (Cervus elaphus) are the main prey for wolves in this region, but wolves also prey secondarily on mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), and bison (Bison bison).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_harvest_on_sightings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We evaluated factors that influenced annual wolf sightings in DNPP using a suite of generalized linear models and Akaike information criterion corrected for sample sizes and an estimate of overdispersion (QAICc) to rank models [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the glm function in Program R (R Core Team 2013) to model wolf sightings using a binomial distribution with the response variable as the annual probability of wolf sightings, weighted by the number of trips per year to account for sample size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predictor variables consisted of the 2 population and 3 harvest metrics described above (Table 2), and our model set consisted of 14 models selected a-priori that included 13 predictors per model (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the MuMIn package in R [36] for model selection and derived untransformed parameter estimates and associated standard errors from the top ranked model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a variance partitioning procedure to quantify how much of the variation of the top-ranked model was explained by the pure effect of each explanatory variable and the interaction of the variables [3739].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared estimates of population size between years with and without the buffer zone using a one-tailed t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used nonparametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests to compare PNRI and annual probability of sightings between these periods because these variables did not meet the assumptions of t-tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We lacked sufficient years of data in YNP to construct quantitative models of sightings including all covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we visually examined patterns in the annual sighting metric in relation to TotalPop and PNRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared annual probability of sightings in years with and without harvest of wolves from packs in the prior regulatory year using a one-tailed t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study provides the first quantitative evidence that harvest of wildlife adjacent to protected areas can reduce wildlife sighting opportunities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Harvest of wolves was associated with reduced sightings in both Denali and Yellowstone National Parks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability of viewing a wolf was 45% greater in YNP following years with no harvest of a wolf from a road pack, and sightings in DNPP were more than twice as high in years with the presence of a wolf harvest buffer (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a trend indicating that sightings decreased as the number of wolves harvested adjacent to DNPP increased, although the relationship was weak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings imply a trade-off between harvest (i.e., consumptive use) of large carnivores and the non-consumptive viewing opportunities and associated economic benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we found that population size, pack size and den site location were strong drivers of sighting opportunities for wolves within these protected areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that harvest is likely to have particularly strong effects on sightings when harvest reduces population size or affects breeding behavior within protected regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human-caused mortality of large carnivores adjacent to protected areas can lead to population declines within the protected region [4042] which our research indicates has the largest potential to decrease viewing opportunities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although harvest of wolves in our study systems may not have occurred at rates generally considered sufficient to reduce population size (reviewed in [43]), harvest may influence sightings through other mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behavioral avoidance of humans by wolves following exposure to hunting or trapping could reduce sightings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although wolves show preference for linear travel corridors [44] and roads with low levels of traffic [8,45], wolves will avoid of high levels of human activity [4648].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of hunters is known to affect large carnivore behavior and movements [49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the direct link between exposure to harvest and subsequent behavioral avoidance leading to reduction in sightings was not explicitly tested in our analysis and warrants further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monitoring behavior of large carnivores that survive negative encounters with humans is needed to determine the strength of these anti-predatory responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selection for behavioral traits may be another method by which harvest of carnivores could decrease sightings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study systems, a small number of wolves may contribute to a large number of wolf sighting opportunities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Harvest can selectively target bold individuals [50, 51], thereby removing bold individuals and over time, the trait, from populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, phenotypic changes driven by human harvest can outpace selection of traits driven by other forces [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As large carnivores that are less wary may contribute disproportionately to viewing opportunities, sightings could decrease if harvest selects these individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that harvest of breeding wolves would disproportionately influence sightings, because these individuals play an important role in pack continuity and reproduction [9, 53] and were more likely to be near the road than non-breeding wolves [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although harvest reduced sightings, the breeding status of harvested wolves was not identified as an important factor in our analyses (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, our results suggest that harvest of wolves from road packs may have a larger influence on sightings than harvest of other wolves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sightings were not reduced in YNP following the harvest of 2 wolves that were not members of road packs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These wolves resided in the park but likely contributed little to sightings as they did not live along the road corridor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we caution that our results from YNP were based on a limited sample size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recommend continued monitoring of carnivore sightings and increased emphasis on identifying age, reproductive status and social group affiliation for carnivores harvested adjacent to protected areas to increase our understanding of these influences on sightings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collared wolves made up over half of the harvest adjacent to YNP but were only approximately a quarter of wolves in the YNP population, whereas collared wolves were harvested in proportion to their occurrence in the DNPP population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major difference between these parks is that harvest near YNP is through hunting whereas harvest near DNPP is primarily through trapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both harvest methods have the potential to act as selective forces on behavioral traits (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bold or unwary individuals), hunting involves more active selection by humans whereas trapping passively selects wolves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distinction could explain why there was disproportional harvest of collared wolves adjacent to YNP and not adjacent to DNPP if hunters targeted collared wolves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that results from YNP were based on three years of data, and longer term analysis could yield different results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, the disproportional harvest of collared individuals may be a mechanism by which sightings decrease following harvest, as the presence of collared individuals aids in locating individuals (R. McIntyre, pers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  obs.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  or understanding behavioral patterns [54] thereby creating viewing opportunities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In both parks, the number of identified breeders that were harvested was not different than expected given their proportion in the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected that breeders would be less likely to be harvested, particularly when trapping was the primary source of harvest, as in DNPP [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the benefit of experience and age in avoiding trapping may be offset in protected regions by habituation to human activity and use of linear travel corridors during the summer months [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the primary source of harvest was hunting, the result in YNP is consistent with previous findings [2325].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of the trapping and hunting buffer zone was associated with increased wolf sightings in DNPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the wolf population size and PNRI, which were strongly associated with increased wolf sightings, were also greater during the period when the buffer zone was in place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the presence of the buffer may have influenced local population size and the likelihood that wolves would den near the park road.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the increase in sightings may have been a result of coincidental peaks in population size or PNRI as a result of variables not measured or explicitly included in our models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two variables generally considered to be strong drivers of wolf population dynamics are prey density and snow conditions, which influence prey vulnerability to wolf predation [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, during the period of the study, prey densities were relatively consistent [5557].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, although snow conditions varied among years, there has been no statistically significant trend in the annual snowfall data for park headquarters over the past 20 years [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traffic levels, managed at a consistent level during the study period, likely did not influence annual trends in sightings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly in YNP, there was a decrease in sightings during years with harvest that did not appear to be explained by a change in wolf population size or change in the size of packs near the road (Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our sample size was low, the decrease was statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither climatic conditions nor prey base were thought to significantly alter wolf population dynamics in YNP during the study period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elk population was stable during the study time period, and although snow depth in winter 20102011 was above average, the other winters were within the average range for snowfall and temperature [59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there was an increase in visitation in YNP during the study period, there was no indication that annual wolf sighting trends were influenced by this pattern in visitation [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The opportunity to view free ranging large carnivores is an important driver for wildlife tourism worldwide, and the National Park Service mission in particular emphasizes the preservation of wildlife resources in their natural condition for the non-consumptive benefit and enjoyment of the public.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, factors that influence sightings of iconic wildlife such as wolves are important to track and understand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have shown that consumptive use of a large carnivore reduces opportunities for non-consumptive use in protected areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limiting harvest of large carnivores along the boundaries of protected areas may provide a strategy to increase sighting opportunities for visitors to these areas and the associated economic benefits to adjacent communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are associated costs of limiting harvest, given the revenue generated from hunting [17, 19, 60] and the potential of harvest to reduce threats to livestock and increase land owners acceptance of large carnivores [61, 62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross boundary movements will continue to make large carnivore management an on-going source of debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wolf viewing and harvest opportunities are 2 of the many issues surrounding cross boundary wolf management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are many stakeholders, including state and federal management agencies, private land owners, trappers, hunters, non-profit agencies, environmental advocates, and the general public Effective management in areas where cross boundary movements are common requires knowledge of complex system dynamics, in addition to understanding and defining the objectives of stakeholders, and quantifying the associated costs and benefits of management actions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
