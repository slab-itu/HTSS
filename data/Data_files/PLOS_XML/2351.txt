Health management and pattern analysis of daily living activities of people with dementia using in-home sensors and machine learning techniques  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The number of people diagnosed with dementia is expected to rise in the coming years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that there is currently no definite cure for dementia and the cost of care for this condition soars dramatically, slowing the decline and maintaining independent living are important goals for supporting people with dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paper discusses a study that is called Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TIHM is a technology assisted monitoring system that uses Internet of Things (IoT) enabled solutions for continuous monitoring of people with dementia in their own homes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have developed machine learning algorithms to analyse the correlation between environmental data collected by IoT technologies in TIHM in order to monitor and facilitate the physical well-being of people with dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The algorithms are developed with different temporal granularity to process the data for long-term and short-term analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extract higher-level activity patterns which are then used to detect any change in patients routines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also developed a hierarchical information fusion approach for detecting agitation, irritability and aggression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have conducted evaluations using sensory data collected from homes of people with dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed techniques are able to recognise agitation and unusual patterns with an accuracy of up to 80%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dementia is a syndrome consisting of a group of symptoms that suggest progressive brain dysfunction and global impairment of cognition or intellects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dementia usually manifests as problems with memory and orientation, thinking processes, learning and language, calculation and comprehension, judgement and emotion and several other symptoms [1, 2] to an extent that it decreases functionality in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are currently around 46.8 million people living with dementia around the world, with numbers set to increase to 74.7 million by 2030 and 131.5 million by 2050 [4], and it has a direct impact on an individuals health, quality of life, and ability to live independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  World Alzheimers Report 2015 reveals that the annual societal and economic cost of dementia is 818 billion USD, and is expected to increase to trillion dollar disease in the next few years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reports show that the cost of dementia has increased by 35% since 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that there is no current definite cure/treatment for dementia, slowing the decline, stabilisation, and maintaining independent functioning are important goals in supporting people with dementia [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One approach to enhance independent living is to utilise assistive technologies in peoples homes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, several studies have evaluated the benefits of assistive technologies in the elderly demographic [610]; however, very few have focused on individuals with dementia [3, 11, 12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Traditionally, monitoring the functional capability and cognition of people with dementia is assessed through questionnaires or clinical interviews during clinic visits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent technology-based assessment systems can facilitate continuous monitoring of patients in their own living environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides continuous and fine-grained information about the individuals health and well-being (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  their daily activity patterns, physical ability and state) that cannot be obtained through infrequent and intermittent visits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysing the continuously monitored data provides reliable long-term assessments and can generate actionable information about an individuals activities, trends and routines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, several studies have focused on the activity recognition and routine detection using in-home sensors [10, 1318].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, [10, 13] used passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors to define activities for a particular location, [14] used PIR motion densities to capture the activity level, and [15, 16] analysed the sequential pattern of activities recorded via PIR sensors to investigate changes in health conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, some studies have focused on the detection of cognitive changes using a combination of motion, pressure, and door sensors [10, 17, 18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, activities are detected either through specific rules or by applying learning techniques using labelled datawhich is not available for uncontrolled real-world environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in this work, we aim to provide a robust and more generic approach to discover the underlying pattern of participants activities given a large data set that contains unlabelled data (see Section Macro assessment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, most of the existing research focus exclusively on physiological parameters or environmental data, and often, neglect their correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this study integrates physiological and environmental data and utilises adaptive algorithms where the relationship between environmental and physiological data is considered in extracting health and well-being related information (see Section Micro assessment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Applying data analytics and machine learning algorithms has a great potential for a preventative approach in healthcare services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Technology-based monitoring systems provide an opportunity to support patients with chronic conditions, who live in their own homes [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have demonstrated that such systems enhance quality of life, prolong independent living and reduce caregivers burden and healthcare costs in general, while maintaining the patients safety [7, 8, 11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The goal of the current work is to develop an innovative living environment which empowers people with dementia and their caregivers to benefit from healthcare support and have better quality of life in their own homes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have developed an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for a technology integrated health management (TIHM) system which facilitates automated monitoring and assists healthcare practitioners to support people with dementia and their caregivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In TIHM, we have developed machine learning and data analytics algorithms that combine physiological and environmental data to learn and discover changes in patients health and well-being.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows early identification of patients needs and provides better quality of care for people with dementia [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A higher-level overview of the interactions in the TIHM architecture is shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system has four components: 1) sensors installed in homes, 2) TIHM back-end system including the integration tool, storage and analysis methods, 3) the user interface for data visualisation and presenting clinical, environmental and technical alerts as well as learned insights and actionable information and 4) clinical pathways where a group of healthcare practitioners monitor the data 24/7 and interact with the patients, caregivers and respond to their healthcare needs around the clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Problem_statement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this paper, we describe machine learning algorithms that aim to support the physical well-being of people with dementia by analysing raw observations and measurement data alongside environmental data, collected from their homes as shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collected data in the TIHM project is integrated and processed using several data analytics and machine learning algorithms to generate personalised notifications based on patients needs, aligned to the parameters set by the clinical team.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information is monitored around the clock by a group of healthcare practitioners (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the monitoring team) who take appropriate decisions by following a clinical algorithm taking into account the collected data and generated notifications (i.e., actionable information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach allows the clinical team to provide more effective support at the earliest point of need to prevent escalating situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the monitoring team validates the generated notifications and this information is used for the evaluation of the developed machine learning techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These algorithms include (1) rule-based reasoning methods for vital measurements and providing adaptive learning mechanisms to make them more personalised and (2) machine-learning techniques to learn the individuals activities/patterns and detect unusual deviations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we propose pattern detection algorithms that provide a holistic view of patients activity and routines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysing patients data at different temporal granularity has enabled us to develop automated procedures for macro and micro assessments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The objective of our proposed macro assessment is to look for unusual patterns on a larger time span (i.e., daily or weekly scale).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the micro assessment framework is more focused on detecting underlying activity patterns that can be used to infer the day-to-day well-being of people with dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, we have investigated the detection of patterns that directly correlate with Agitation, Irritation and Aggression (AIA) which are commonly observed in people with dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study protocol for this work has been reviewed and approved by the South East Coast Surrey NHS Research Ethics Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained informed consent from all the study participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each participant was assessed according to Mental Capacity Act guidelines (available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice) by a fully qualified researcher who has completed a mandatory clinical practice course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants understood the study and were able to understand the consent process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants in this study have had a confirmed diagnosis of dementia (mild to moderate) within, at least, the past three months and have been stable on dementia medication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants live in Surrey area and have been receiving a minimum of 10 hours care per week from their family or a formal caregiver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were recruited from the dementia research list held by the research and development (R&D) team in Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SABP), self-referral and referral from general practitioners (GPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each participant was recruited over a six months trial period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the trial, the environmental data was continuously recorded via sensors installed in participants homes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The environmental sensors consist of 2 PIR sensors, 4 motion sensors, 2 pressure sensors, 1 door sensor and 1 central energy consumption monitoring device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physiological data was recorded twice a day by participants using the Bluetooth-enabled medical devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physiological data includes blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, weight and hydration readings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All the methods were performed in accordance with the ethics guidelines and regulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed macro and micro assessment methods are described in the following sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pattern_analysis__Macro_assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The existing works and dementia trials have shown the high variability of daily activities in people with dementia which leads to dissolving patterns in their daily routines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existing studies demonstrates that individuals with dementia exhibit one or more symptoms which may occur at any time of the day; meaning that people with dementia have more non-structured routine compared to healthy individuals [3, 20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to [3], trend analysis can help identify behavioural anomalies in people with dementia that aid clinicians decision making in providing health and care support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the above, analysing the daily routine plays an important role in monitoring the health and well-being of people with dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have developed algorithms which provide long-term information about the participants routines by analysing the sequence of their daily activities (inferred from sensory observations and measurements).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information is used to observe if participant is constantly deviating from her/his routine, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  exhibiting unusual patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, further investigation is required to distinguish whether these deviations are related to the technical infrastructure faults, environmental changes (i.e., having visitors) or are associated with possible condition change which may indicate the progression of the cognitive decline in people with dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this section, unusual patterns are referred to as anomaly which is defined based on the sequence of activities; i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sequence alignment is used to detect unusual pattern in daily activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse the daily routines and detect unusual patterns, a Markov chain is employed to model the activity sequences and an entropy rate has been calculated to quantify the regularity of an individuals patterns in their day-to-day life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These concepts are discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pattern_analysis__Micro_assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to detecting unusual activity patterns on a macro level, we have developed algorithms to reason at a finer temporal granularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It allows us to carry micro level automated detection of AIA based on daily activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AIA are common conditions in people with dementia, in conjunction with memory and sleep problems [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A common challenge faced by doctors and caregivers is the detailed and continuous monitoring of AIA, since it is mostly reported by second-hand accounts that are susceptible to bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is mainly because the observer is prone to anxiety and stress that leads to erroneous observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, it is of high importance to take into consideration the context in which the observed symptoms were reported, their frequency and detection of any possible drift over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AIA symptoms not only adversely affect the health of the patient but also of their caregivers [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to address the problem, our proposed framework uses contextual information obtained from various combinations of sensing modalities, allowing it to continuously monitor and detect any unusual pattern in the participants daily activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is important to note that symptoms of agitation can be imperfectly categorised as hyperactive or hypoactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyperactive symptoms in dementia include abnormality in the motion pattern, an increased frequency of repetitive actions such as chair movement or leg movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, hypoactive symptoms in dementia exhibit complete disengagement and isolation from activities or depression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focus on the assessment and detection of hyperactivity in people with dementia and use this to determine the chance of AIA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our proposed AIA detection algorithm consists of a sensing layer, decision layers and a fusion layer, as shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functionality of each of these layers is discussed below:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results_and_discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this section, we discuss our empirical evaluations of macro and micro assessment approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Macro_level_assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first algorithm (i.e., macro level assessment) is used to learn an individuals daily patterns and detect anomalies We selected 12 participants for whom we collected data for more than three months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an illustrative example, see Fig 4 depicting five subplots (each representing one sensory data) in which x-axis and y-axis represent day and time, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data from these sensors are then aggregated and has been represented as a five-dimensional array, see Fig 4b-top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the next step, K-means algorithm is used to map each five-dimensional window to a single state as shown in Fig 4b-middle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a second K-means algorithm is used to divide the days into low-activity and high-activity categories, see Fig 4b-bottom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data used in this algorithm is unlabelled and collected from uncontrolled environments where anomalies could be related to various conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, an anomaly may originate from a technical issue (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  connectivity problems or sensor malfunctioning resulting in data loss), temporary changes in the recording environment (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  being away for multiple days or having visitors) and/or activity changes associated with a patients cognitive decline (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  being agitated and restless more often); this makes it challenging to specify the source of a detected anomaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in order to validate the detected anomalies, we take advantage of the complementary information that is available for each participant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the TIHM project, we analyse the collected environmental and physiological data in (near) real-time and generate environmental or clinical notifications, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we carry out continuous technical monitoring (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for connectivity status and battery level) and generate technical notifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A group of healthcare practitioners (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the monitoring team) monitor this information 24/7, contact participants and/or their caregivers, and confirm whether the generated notifications were reported correctly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the monitoring team keep a record of details obtained from participants (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dates of hospital admission, travelling and/or family visits).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combination is used as complementary information to validate the detected anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the overall macro level detection, we have performed weekly analysis of the target participants in order to calculate the overall sensitivity  using Eq (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(9)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Wval is the total numbers of weeks correctly labelled as anomaly whereas Wtot represents the total number of weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also calculated the correlation corr between the total number of anomalies Na and the total number of validated notifications Nn for all the subjects using Eq (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(10)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These notifications are generated based on various observations and measurements that are processed by the data analytics engine as discussed in detail in the TIHM project [19], and are presented to the clinical monitoring team via a secure web portal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these numbers originate from various sources of information, they were normalised to highlight the existing relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5, the high correlation between these series demonstrates that most of the study participants with a higher number of unusual patterns had more notifications in our automated monitoring system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information can be used to prioritise patients and provide more effective and timely support at the earliest point of need to prevent escalating the conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The anomalies detected in this section originate from various scenarios, for instance, technical issues (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  connectivity problems or sensor malfunctioning), temporary changes in the recording environment (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  being away for multiple days or having visitors) and/or activity pattern changes (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  being agitated and restless more often).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integration of the insights generated by the algorithms provide actionable information which allows us to monitor and track the general condition of people with dementia participating in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only the last case (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  anomalies due to symptoms such as AIA) is directly associated with individuals condition and/or their cognitive decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in the next section, we provide results of the AIA algorithm which are related to the patients health and well-being.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Micro_assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the many technical challenges of the TIHM project was to acquire ground truth information that is necessary to train, tune and evaluate the machine learning algorithms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the annotation of AIA symptom is rather challenging, since it is susceptible to human bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To approach the problem of detecting possible AIA events in an automated fashion, we adopted a statistical threshold based approach, namely median absolute deviation (MAD) [34] detection to detect the presence of outlying values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach makes use of the training data to compute the MAD value that acts as a threshold to generate alerts for detecting the change in patients observation and measurement data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the alerts were generated, the clinical team at the hospitals obtained the true annotation of these events by contacting the caregiver and verifying the alerts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the labels of these initial events were duly updated in the database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our empirical evaluation, the algorithms generated a total of 74 AIA event flags that were duly verified by the clinical team as AIA or non-AIA and were used in the cross-validation phase for the performance estimation of our models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although, the naive approach helps provide a clue to the system with regards to abnormality, however in the context of AIA detection, simple statistical thresholds generates a large number of false positives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our naive approach takes into account the re-occurring movement patterns of the user based on the time of the day and the reported motion sensor values, enabling it to classify normal and abnormal movement patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, movement pattern of participant A as shown in Fig 6 is flagged as normal by the algorithm based on its probability of re-occurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6 exhibits that participant is normally active in the hallway during early morning between 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, we see a clear movement pattern in the living room between 20:00 to 22:00 PM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, an abnormal movement pattern would differ from the normal pattern as shown in Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This figure shows that not only there is an overall increased movement activity reported in comparison to normal day pattern but also the successive movement patterns between the hallways and living room during the midday indicates an unusual routine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon contacting the patient, our clinical team found that the abnormality in the movement is recorded due to the presence of guests in the house.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains that statistical thresholds relying on activity count alone is not a reliable metric to generate alerts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the context of the movement pattern and the relationship between different activities must be taken into account to accurately detect AIA events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this issue and reduce the number of false positives, we decoupled the participant-specific movement model and the aggregated movement model using a weighting algorithm described in the methodology section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A standard evaluation method, namely Area Under the Curve (AUC) measure associated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve [108] is adopted to quantify the performance of our algorithms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ROC curve is a plot of fraction of true positives versus false positives varied at various threshold settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AUC is the area under the curve which summarises the ROC curve in one number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AUC score of 1 means that the model/classifier has made no classification errors, whereas a random classifier will likely to achieve an AUC score of 0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report the model performance estimate in terms of AUC score averaged over 10 folds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of AIA flags generated by the system is used as a test data and the performance of the participant-specific, multi-occupancy and decision fusion models is measured against the duly validated labels provided by the clinical teams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be clearly seen from Fig 8 that multi-occupancy model alone achieves a low AUC score, indicating lots of miss-classification of AIA events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, we inferred that multi-occupancy patterns do correlate with the AIA symptoms to an extent; but is not reliable enough to be used as a final inference alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using only this information we achieved an AUC score of 58%, as shown in Fig 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the participant specific model has shown a performance improvement over multi-occupancy model and reports a AUC score of 73%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the reported evaluation results discussed above and in Fig 8 clearly suggest that decision fusion outperforms the previous two approaches and it considerably improves the reliability of the system in detecting AIA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed decision fusion strategy yields a significant improvement of 14% and 29% against the participant-specific and multi-occupancy models, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported in Table 1, the weighted precision and recall metrics of the fusion model are above 80%, which depicts that decision fusion helps improves the overall precision and reliability of AIA event classification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions_and_future_work  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) project utilises IoT-enabled technologies to monitor people with dementia in their living environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the key contributions of TIHM is developing machine learning and data analytics algorithms that combine environmental and physiological data to learn and discover changes in participants health and well-being.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paper presents a novel approach to profile the daily patterns of people with dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed algorithms provide actionable information to assist the diagnosis and decision making of clinicians, while being non-invasive and privacy-aware.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we target the challenge of learning the daily activity patterns of people who are affected by cognition decline in order to detect changes in their routines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conjunction, by analysing the continuous data stream from sensory data sources, we infer Agitation, Irritation and Aggression (AIA) events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our proposed hierarchical fusion algorithm shows that a data-driven detection of abnormal patterns such as AIA is feasible by analysing the raw observation and measurement from different sensory devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model learns the individuals repetitive patterns and performs (near-) real-time activity classification, segmentation and abnormality detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed algorithms by conducting classification and prediction-based evaluations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The future work will focus on validation of the proposed methods on larger population sizes in a longer time-span.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also plan to develop predictive and incremental learning models to provide more information and insights that can be extracted from monitoring physiological and environmental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work has been a step towards using sensory and automated observation and measurement data in real clinical settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed how environmental and sensory data is used to improve the clinical decision making and enhance the care and support given to patients and their caregivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
