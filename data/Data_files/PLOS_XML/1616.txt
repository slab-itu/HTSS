Neogene Proto-Caribbean porcupinefishes (Diodontidae)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fossil Diodontidae in Tropical America consist mostly of isolated and fused beak-like jawbones, and tooth plate batteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These durophagous fishes are powerful shell-crushing predators on shallow water invertebrate faunas from Neogene tropical carbonate bottom, rocky reefs and surrounding flats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use an ontogenetic series of high-resolution micro CT of fossil and extant species to recognize external and internal morphologic characters of jaws and tooth plate batteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare similar sizes of jaws and/or tooth-plates from both extant and extinct species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe three new fossil species including Chilomycterus exspectatus n. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Chilomycterus tyleri n. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from the late Miocene Gatun Formation in Panama, and Diodon serratus n. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from the middle Miocene Socorro Formation in Venezuela.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fossil Diodontidae review included specimens from the Neogene Basins of the Proto-Caribbean (Brazil: Pirabas Formation; Colombia: Jimol Formation, Panama: Gatun and Tuira formations; Venezuela: Socorro and Cantaure formations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diodon is present in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, whereas the distribution of Chilomycterus is highly asymmetrical with only one species in the Pacific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems that Diodon was as abundant in the Caribbean/Western Atlantic during the Miocene as it is there today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyze the paleogeographic distribution of the porcupinefishes group in Tropical America, after the complete exhumation of the Panamanian isthmus during the Pliocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The uplift of the Central American isthmus [1,2,3] interrupted the Pacific-Atlantic seaway and drove large-scale rearrangement in the ocean circulation [4,5,6,7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It produced environmental changes that distinguish todays Eastern Pacific and Western Atlantic habitats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pacific side is characterized by productive surface water caused by coastal upwelling and abundant fast-growing suspension and detritus feeders on the sea bottom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the Caribbean is characterized by more carbonate-rich habitats, nutrient-poor waters, and abundant seagrass and large coral reef assemblages in shallow waters [8,9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are also large Miocene-Pliocene hydrographic changes along the northern border of South America, including the Paleo Amazon-Magdalena-Orinoco fluvial system, with complex river delta systems producing high freshwater discharge to the South Caribbean and extensive estuarine environments [10,11,12,13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These early hydrographic system could be linked with the origins of marine-derived freshwater fishes, including extant pufferfishes species (Tetraodontiformes) [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Current discussions about the uplift of the Central American isthmus suggest a gradual emergence of the volcanic Panama Arch [15], which started with the formation of a land bridge connecting central Panama with North America during the Aquitanian (early Miocene) [16], a subsequent and progressive formation of the isthmus during the Langhian/Serravallian (middle Miocene) [2], and a final closure of the Pacific-Atlantic connection by the complete uplift of the Isthmus of Panama during the early Pliocene [1,2,3,17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The formation of the Isthmus of Panama should not be seen as an isolated but global event integrating data at the regional and global levels as complex Atlantic-Pacific teleconnections, such as currents, winds, salinity and temperature of waters, as well as paleodepth and paleoenvironments of deposition of the geological units [9, 18,19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The history of Central Western Atlantic and Central Eastern Pacific distribution of fossil fish records during the Neogene has been closely related to the evolution of the oceanic pathway connecting both oceans across the Panamanian isthmus [20,21,22,23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extant porcupinefishes (Diodontidae) comprise seven genera and 18 species [24,25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diodon and Chilomycterus are today widely distributed in all circumtropical regions [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diodon, the most common and widespread porcupinefish, is represented by five species: Diodon eydouxii, D. holocanthus D. hystrix, D. nicthemerus and D. liturosus [24,26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chilomycterus also is represented by five species: Chilomycterus antennatus, C. antillarum, C. reticulatus, C. schoepfii and C. spinosus [24,26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the oceanic regions of the Americas, there are three species of Diodon, along both the Eastern Pacific and Western Atlantic coasts; in contrast, from the Eastern Pacific Chilomycterus, is represented by one species [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic studies of extant populations of Diodontidae have revealed that the divergence times of sister species do not extend beyond the early Oligocene [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oldest record of Diodontidae in South America comes from the Cretaceous of Brazil [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neogene Diodontidae from Tropical America were previously recorded in shallow water deposits from the early Miocene of Brazil [29], early Miocene of Venezuela [30], Miocene of Panama [31,32], middle-late Miocene to early Pliocene of Trinidad [33], middle Miocene of Florida (USA) [34], late Miocene of Cuba [35], and Pleistocene of Jamaica [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along the Atlantic coast of the USA, these fishes also have been found in the Pliocene of North Carolina [37,38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fossil skeletons of Diodontidae from the Neogene of Tropical America have been poorly represented and consist mostly of isolated and fragmentary jawbones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The massive and fused beak-like jawbones characterize these fishes as powerful shell-crushing predators on tropical coral and rocky reefs and surrounding flats [39,40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These durophagous fishes exploit environments with diverse and abundant shallow-water invertebrate faunas, mostly mollusks, echinoids and crustaceans [41,42,43,44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Morphological [39,45,46,47,48] and molecular studies support the monophyly of Diodontidae [49,50,51], with Chilomycterus being sister to Diodon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their divergence time (node-base age of all molecular based dates) has been estimated variously at 10.9 Ma [52], 18 Ma [49], 20.8 Ma [51], and 55.6 Ma [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we review and describe three new fossil Diodontidae species from the Neogene Basins of the Proto-Caribbean, and analyze the paleogeographic distribution of the group in Tropical America, after the complete exhumation of the Panamanian isthmus during the Pliocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fossils consist of isolated jaws and tooth plate batteries collected from six Miocene localities from the Pirabas (Brazil), Jimol (Colombia), Gatun and Tuira (Panama), and Socorro and Cantaure (Venezuela) formations (Figs 1, 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens were collected from outcrops during several independent expeditions by O. Aguilera, F. Rodriguez, C. Jaramillo and J. Carrillo-Briceño.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specimens are housed in the paleontological collections of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Belem (MPEG); Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro (MN-UFRJ); Departamento de Geologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (DG-UFRJ), Brazil; Mapuka Museum of Universidad del Norte (MUN), Barranquilla, Colombia; Naturhistorisches Museum of Basel (NMB), Switzerland; Paleontological collections of the Alcaldía del Municipio de Urumaco (AMU-CURS) and Universidad Experimental Francisco de Miranda (UNEFM), Venezuela.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taxonomic identification of examined species (Fig 4, S1 File), comparative studies of fossil (Figs 5 and 6, S2 File) and extant species (Figs 7 and 8, S3S7 Files) were based on the ichthyological collections of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP), USA; American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), USA; Museum of Natural History of Wien (NHMW), Austria; Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN), France; Naturhistorisches Museum of Basel (NMB), Switzerland; Museo Nacional de Historia Natural de La Havana (MNHNH), Cuba; Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Brazil, and on extensive bibliographical review.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We gathered habitat information of living representatives from the FishBase website [67] and additional updated records [68,69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maps of geographical distribution were based on IPCC A2 emissions scenario [www.aquamaps.org, version of Aug. 2013].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

3D high-resolution micro CT scans of fossil and recent lower-jaw specimens were obtained from a desktop system (Bruker/Skyscan 1173), which was calibrated to operate at 55 kV voltage and 145A current with a flat-panel detector matrix of 2240 x 2240 pixels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pixel size of 14.8 m was used with a scanning step rotation along the z axis of 0.8° over 360°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The longest axis (thicker part) of each sample was aligned perpendicular to the rotation axis of the equipment, which provides the shortest X-ray path length through the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is important because it results in different degrees of beam hardening effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sets of these micro CT projections were reconstructed by using a mathematical process called filtered back projection [70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By reducing the artifacts produced by beam hardening and ring, which are inherent to the scanning [71], we were able to improve the image quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Geological_context_and_locations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fossil jaws and tooth plate batteries of Diodontidae were obtained from a variety of Neogene formations from Tropical America (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 summarizes the stratigraphic context of the fossil collections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differential_morphology_of_tooth-plates_in_Diodon_and_Chilomycterus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Osteological research in extant Diodontidae conducted by Tyler [45] revealed an exponential increase in the number of dental sheets in the tooth batteries of Diodon (~5 to 40) as a function of the increase in the standard length (63550 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in the ontogenetic series (S1 Fig) the early stages in Diodon (specimen size less_than220 mm) overlap all Chilomycterus specimens with standard length of 72 to 580 mm): 520 dental sheets in Diodon vs. 718 in Chilomycterus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike the large body-size specimens of Diodon, which have more than 35 dental sheets, a large specimen of C. reticulatus, with standard length ~580 mm has only 18 dental sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ontogenetic series of Diodon jaws reveals that the frontal teeth form a cutting edge distant from the crushing tooth-plate batteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the massive tooth-plate batteries are restricted to the posterior most area of the occlusal surface of the mandible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the cutting edge of the jaw in Chilomycterus is close to the tooth-plate batteries; it begins with the front tooth series, surrounds the grinding surface, and continues posteriorly along the jaw.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These durophagous morpho-functional differences are characterized by massive and high tooth-plate batteries in Diodon vs. slender and low tooth-plate batteries in Chilomycterus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Diodon, the ontogenetic changes in the arrangements of the crushing surface could be associated with food preference; mollusks (44.5 to 70.5%), echinoids (11.6 to 34.6%) and crustaceans (20.8 to 37%) are the most important food [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large Diodon hystrix individuals are able to crush exceptionally strong shells, exerting a force of 5000 N (equivalent of 500 Kg load) [44,108].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, specimens of Chilomyctetrus (C. schoepfi) with around 20 cm body size are capable of generating a force of only 380 N (equivalent of 38 Kg load) in the crushing plate [109].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chilomycterus food preferences consist mostly of mollusks (56.6%) and crustaceans (43.4%) [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fossil species of Diodontidae from the Neogene described by Schultz [110] had ~37 dental sheets in the tooth battery in Diodon and 812 in Chilomycterus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use an ontogenetic series of micro CT scans to quantify and compare the number of dental sheets in the tooth-plate batteries (S2S7 Files).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare similar sizes of jawbones and/or tooth-plates from both extant and extinct species of Diodon and Chilomycterus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The external and internal morphology of extant and fossil jawbones in Diodon accessed with micro CT imaging shows the oblique arrangements of numerous dental sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crushing surface batteries exhibit 924 oblique-parallel dental sheets (Figs 4.16, 6.16.6, 7.17.9 and 7.137.14, S3 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Chilomycterus exhibits only a few dental sheets; the crushing-surface batteries are composed of 2 to 4 superficial dental sheets arranged horizontally and 5 to 6 inner dental sheets (Figs 4.14.15, 5.15.4, 5.65.11, 7.10, 7.12, 7.14, 7.16 and 8, S2, S4S7 Files).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uppermost dental sheets of the crushing surface could be missing or broken in the fossil specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diodontidae fossil jawbones and tooth plate battery preserved in the sedimentary basins from the early to late Miocene Tropical Western Central Atlantic (TCWA) and from the Miocene Tropical Eastern Central Pacific (TECP), reveal a valuable opportunity to understand the paleobiogeography of Diodontidae fauna and contribute to elucidate the macroevolutionary responses in coastal faunule affected by the paleoceanographic and paleoenvironmental changes in the region caused by the tectonic dynamics and finally the severance of the Central American Seaway by the uplift of the Panamanian isthmus, the complete Atlantic-Pacific oceans isolation and the final configuration of the Caribbean Sea (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These geological scenarios are needed to fully understand under regional researches in response of the continuous debate [3,18,19] and the expectation of future paleontological research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fossil Diodon is present in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, whereas the distribution of Chilomycterus is highly asymmetrical, with only one species in the Pacific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diodon appears to have been as abundant in the Caribbean/Western Atlantic during the Miocene as it is there today (Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Amphi-American fossil marine assemblages, relict species, paciphile or germinate species records have been treated at length for corals, crustaceans and fishes [20,21,22,23,117,119,120].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of a Chilomycterus species in the late Miocene of a Pacific deposit (Tuira FM) requires more research as it is a pattern opposite to the more traditional paciphile pattern from the Proto-Caribbean.The widely circumtropical distribution of Diodontidae (Figs 10 and 11) and the available data suggests that the diversification of Neogene amphi-American species started during the early Miocene, as phylogenies have suggested [49,51,52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unavailable Eocene-Oligocene units in the study area with associated Diodontidae fossil fauna (Fig 3) or specimens from museum collections from Tropical America are the limiting to corroborate older divergence (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  compare with fossil records from the Eocene of Monte Bolca, Italy [121], Northern Caucasus, Russia [122]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C. antennatus (blue circle), C. antillarum (green circle), C. reticulatus (red circle), C. schoepfii (yellow circle) and C. spinosus (purple circle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modified from Froese and Pauly [67], Robertson and Allen [68] and Robertson and Tassell [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181670.g011  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Diodontidae are durophagous fishes that use the power of the fused jaws and the crushing tooth battery to feed on prey with a hard protected shell (mollusks), carapace (crustaceans) or test (echinoids) [41,42,43,44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently the broad distribution in tropical marine shallow waters over sandy, rocky and coral reef bottoms is likely to be related to the available food resources in coastal paleoenvironments, particularly the high abundance and diversity of Neogene tropical American mollusks [54,72,89,99,123], crustaceans [12,124,125,126] and echinoids [127,128,129,130] in all of sedimentary basins where the fossils were found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stratigraphical and fasciological contextual interpretation of the formations treated here (Fig 2) reveal that fossil fish assemblage where the Diodontidae specimens came inhabit over sandy and lime bottom in shallow water and were characterized by the presence of demersal teleostean fish [12, 23, 55, 57, 101,131] mostly Sciaenidae, some of then associated with early estuarine system in the Proto-Caribbean, or bathypelagic species mostly Mycthophidae [21] with diurnal/nocturnal displacement in the water column associated with high planktonic productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elasmobranch fauna are represented mostly by Carcharhinidae [104, 132] that inhabit coastal shallow water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The similarity of the marine fauna preserved in Miocene sediments from Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama and Venezuela promoted the designation of the Gatunian Faunal Province (between TCWA and TECP), named after the late Miocene Gatun Formation in Panama [117,133,134,135,136], whereas the fauna is sufficiently distinct post-isthmus closure to warrant the use of the term Pleistocene Caribbean Province [117].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early Miocene fish assemblages to further characterize the Brazilian equatorial fish faunas amongst these Provinces has yet to be explored [137,138], and reflect the lithostratigraphic sequences across the Proto-Caribbean and the shift from one to the other broadly records a widespread biological extinction and turnover in the TCWA and TECP marine fauna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We believe that the diodontid record presented here represents a baseline for future research, as ongoing paleontological research in the American tropics continues to fill the gaps in the Neogene record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
