Recurrent Domestication by Lepidoptera of Genes from Their Parasites Mediated by Bracoviruses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bracoviruses are symbiotic viruses associated with tens of thousands of species of parasitic wasps that develop within the body of lepidopteran hosts and that collectively parasitize caterpillars of virtually every lepidopteran species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral particles are produced in the wasp ovaries and injected into host larvae with the wasp eggs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once in the host body, the viral DNA circles enclosed in the particles integrate into lepidopteran host cell DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that bracovirus DNA sequences have been inserted repeatedly into lepidopteran genomes, indicating this viral DNA can also enter germline cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original mode of Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) unveiled here is based on the integrative properties of an endogenous virus that has evolved as a gene transfer agent within parasitic wasp genomes for 100 million years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the bracovirus genes thus transferred, a phylogenetic analysis indicated that those encoding C-type-lectins most likely originated from the wasp gene set, showing that a bracovirus-mediated gene flux exists between the 2 insect orders Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the acquisition of bracovirus sequences that can be expressed by Lepidoptera has resulted in the domestication of several genes that could result in adaptive advantages for the host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, functional analyses suggest that two of the acquired genes could have a protective role against a common pathogen in the field, baculovirus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these results, we hypothesize that bracovirus-mediated HGT has played an important role in the evolutionary arms race between Lepidoptera and their pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eukaryotes are generally thought to evolve mainly through the modification of existing genetic information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in eukaryotes-the accidental acquisition of a novel gene from another species, allowing acquisition of novel traitsis now recognized as an important factor in their evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show here that in several lineages, lepidopteran genomes have acquired genes from a bracovirus that is symbiotically used by parasitic wasps to inhibit caterpillar host immune defences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integration of parts of the viral genome into host caterpillar DNA strongly suggests that integration can sporadically occur in the germline, leading to the production of lepidopteran lineages that harbor bracovirus sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, some of the transferred bracovirus genes reported here originate from the wasp genome, demonstrating that a gene flux exists between the two insect orders Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera that diverged 300 MYA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As bracovirus gene organisation has evolved to allow expression in Lepidoptera, these transferred genes can be readily domesticated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we present functional analyses suggesting that some of the acquired genes confer to caterpillars a protection toward baculovirus, a very common pathogen in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon may have implications for understanding how caterpillars acquire resistance against baculoviruses used in biological control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike bacteria, which have obtained a notable proportion of their genes through the acquisition of sequences from distantly related organisms, eukaryotes are generally thought to evolve mainly through the modification of existing genetic information [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in eukaryotes is accumulating and is recognized as an important factor in their evolution and acquisition of novel traits [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of events reported concerns transposable elements, DNA sequences capable of excising or copying themselves from one genomic locus to integrate into another locus [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome sequencing has revealed that eukaryotes have also acquired DNA from symbionts and parasites, probably because the intimacy of these relationships favours DNA exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, numerous insect and nematode genomes contain sequences originating from Wolbachia [7, 8] an endocellular bacteria widespread in insect populations infecting, in particular, host germ line cells [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a systematic investigation of HGT events in three available lepidopteran genomes (Bombyx mori, Danaus plexippus and Heliconius melpomene) revealed multiple ancient HGT events from bacteria and fungi to these lepidopteran genomes [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present an original mode of HGT between two insect orders based on the integrative properties of a virus (bracovirus) that has evolved within parasitic wasp genomes for 100 million years and that is used to facilitate the development of their progeny in caterpillars by inhibiting host immune defenses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one case, we could demonstrate the direction of the transfer based on the presence of a sequence important for the virus life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a rare example where the likely mechanism of HGT can be established in an animal system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover we present functional analyses suggesting that some of the transferred genes have been recycled by Lepidoptera to protect them against a common viral pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bracoviruses play a central role in parasite-host interactions involving parasitic wasps and their caterpillar hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bracoviruses are injected by parasitic wasps into their hosts along with wasp eggs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These wasps develop during their larval stage within the body of their lepidopteran hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tens of thousands of species of wasps belonging to the braconid family and parasitizing a large diversity of lepidopteran species are each associated with a specific bracovirus [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these associations originated from a single integration event of a nudivirus genome in a common ancestor of the wasps [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since this integration 100 MYA, the genes involved in virus particle production have been dispersed in the wasp genome, they are no longer packaged in the particles that contain genes encoding virulence factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover the endogenous chromosomally transmitted virus has evolved depending on its contribution to parasitism success, resulting in a specific set of virulence genes packaged in the particles in the different wasp lineages [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These viruses are now essential for successful development of the wasp larvae within lepidopteran hosts [1315].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral replication and particle production occur exclusively in the wasp ovaries from endogenous viral elements present in the wasp genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The particles, that contain dsDNA circles harbouring the virulence genes, constitute the major component of the fluid injected with the eggs into the parasitized caterpillar host during wasp oviposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once in the host body the particles enter lepidopteran host cells and the host cellular machinery expresses these virulence genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral products ensure wasp larvae survival in the lepidopteran body by interfering with caterpillar host immune responses and development [16, 17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dsDNA circles packaged in the particles are produced from chromosomally transmitted proviral segments stably integrated in the wasp genome [1821].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The typical eukaryotic organization of the genes transferred by the particles [22] and their lack of similarity with viral genes suggest they originate from the wasp genome, which could be demonstrated for a few of them by phylogenetic analyses [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However many genes have diverged in their sequence from insect genes, to the extent that they are currently no more closely related to wasp genes than to mammalian genes [24, 25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many other bracovirus genes have unknown origins and display no similarities to genes in data banks except with other bracovirus sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Cotesia congregata bracovirus (CcBV) encodes 26 bracovirus specific gene families (named BV1 to BV26)[18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously reported that some viral circles were found to be reintegrated in the genome of different geographic strains of the wasp Cotesia sesamiae [13, 26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of circle integrations back into wasp genomes probably reflects a broad integration ability of circles since it was recently shown that integration into the DNA of parasitized lepidopteran host cells is a part of the bracovirus life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed it was shown that Microplitis demolitor bracovirus circle integration into lepidopteran Pseudoplusia includens DNA occurs by a specific mechanism involving a conserved viral site named Host Integration Motif [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During integration the circles are opened specifically at this site, resulting in integrated forms readily distinguishable from that of the proviral form [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of Cotesia sesamiae bracovirus (CsBV) reintegrated circles suggests that the same mechanism was involved in their integration back into the wasp genome [13, 26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parasitized caterpillars represent most of the time an evolutionary dead-end since parasitoid wasps inhibit metamorphosis [28] and the host usually does not survive parasitism [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However it is conceivable that some hosts might successfully defend themselves against the parasite by interrupting wasp oviposition, eliminating the eggs or killing the larvae, resulting in the reproduction of Lepidoptera that have been infected by bracoviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parasitoid wasps could also target non-host species and fail to interfere with their development [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can speculate that caterpillar escape from the fatal issue after virus injection could allow bracovirus particle entry into germ cells and in rare cases stable integration of circles into lepidopteran genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if bracovirus sequences could indeed be integrated into lepidopteran genomes, we compared the DNA sequences packaged in the particles of Cotesia congregata bracovirus (CcBV), the genome of which is almost completely characterized [18], to a series of genomes from non-host Lepidoptera of the parasitoid wasp C. congregata and from Manduca sexta, a regular host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, in contrast to a previous bioinformatic analysis listing a series of bracovirus insertions, most of them relatively short [31], we searched for large nucleotide stretches (more than 500 bp long) that could encode potentially domesticated genes by lepidopteran species and evaluated the evolutionary meaning of these integrations by functional analysis of two of the transferred genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarity searches allowed the identification of bracovirus DNA insertions in the genomes of the monarch (Danaus plexippus), the silkworm (Bombyx mori), the beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) and the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) but not in the genome of tobacco hornworm (M. sexta), the regular host of Cotesia congregata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these insertions were characterized by the presence of large stretches of nucleotide sequences strikingly similar to those of bracoviruses (close to 90% identities at the nucleotide level) flanked by lepidopteran-specific sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertions include genes but also in some cases parts of bracovirus circles, the organization of which has been conserved, indicating the direction of HGT was from bracovirus to Lepidoptera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in one insertion a regulatory signal involved in dsDNA circle production in the wasp has been retained, constituting an unambiguous signature of the bracoviral origin of the sequence since bracovirus replication is non autonomous and occurs exclusively in the wasp ovaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether our data indicate that bracoviruses have been a recurrent source of genes for Lepidoptera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover functional analyses provide convergent results suggesting that some of these genes might contribute to protect larvae against baculoviruses, deadly pathogens that threaten them in the field, which would explain why they have been maintained in lepidopteran genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unexpected levels of similarities were observed between sequences of several lepidopteran genomes and bracoviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of similarity is in the range of that found for homologous genes coding for highly conserved proteins such as histone H4, almost invariant from plants to animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However this similarity is unlikely to be due to conservative selection since the encoded genes are conserved only in a limited number of phylogenetically closely related lepidopteran species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study we report the presence of these bracovirus-related sequences in several lepidopteran genomes and discuss the possible mechanisms involved in their acquisition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to a previous report describing bracovirus DNA insertions in the monarch and silkworm genomes [31] we provide here an in depth analysis of the structure of the bracoviral and lepidopteran flanking sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that monarch insertions are fixed in the species, that their presence in the lineage is ancient and that they have undergone rearrangements since their integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By measuring selection pressures using genomes from individuals of 80 monarch and 8 related species we show that the selection acting on these genes is mainly conservative, which suggests the domesticated Ben genes could play a role in monarch physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition we report for the first time HGT and domestication of bracovirus sequences in Lepidoptera of the Spodoptera lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover we present functional analysis on 2 unrelated genes suggesting the transferred genes could protect the Lepidoptera against a viral pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High similarities observed could be due in theory either to DNA sequence transfer from bracovirus to lepidopteran genomes or vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wasp larvae containing a bracovirus as an endogenous virus have an intimate relationship with Lepidoptera since they develop within the body of their hosts, for this reason it is possible that acquisition of lepidopteran genes by bracoviruses can occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly horizontal transfer of a Mariner like transposable element (MLE) shared by a parasitoid wasp and its host was previously reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the direction of the transfer was supposed to be from Lepidoptera to Hymenoptera based on the presence of this transposon in closely related species of the lepidopteran host and its absence in a closely related parasitoid species [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another horizontal transfer of a transposable element (Helitron) was reported between Copidosoma floridanum an endoparasitoid wasp (not associated with a bracovirus) and the Lepidoptera Trichoplusia ni suggesting that parasitism might favor horizontal transfer of TEs [47] but the direction of the transfer was not determined in that study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, Thomas et al., (2010) also found evidence of horizontal transfer of Helitrons in bracoviruses and Bombyx mori [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the insertions described here is particularly informative regarding the direction of the transfer because it contains a regulatory sequence typical of bracoviruses (see Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences named Direct Repeat Junction (DRJ) that terminate all bracovirus proviral segments are conserved among BVs [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These direct repeats are involved in dsDNA circle production [49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During viral replication, large molecules are amplified that serve as precursors for the production of individual circles, produced by a recombination between the DRJs [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, a single DRJ (resulting from the recombination) is present on a circle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This recombination process was confirmed recently by inactivation of two Tyrosine recombinase genes (vlf1 and int-1) using RNA interference, which resulted in impairment of circle formation [50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a DRJ in the BV2-5 insertion in the S. exigua genome constitutes an unambiguous signature of its bracoviral origin since these regulatory elements are specific of the bracovirus life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clearly demonstrates that the BV2-5 sequence originated from the bracovirus and was acquired by the lepidopteran genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The direction of the other horizontal transfers, although not as clearly proven, also appears to be more likely from bracovirus to Lepidoptera genomes, because only a limited number of closely related lepidopteran species harbour these sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover bracovirus life cycle features suggest they are involved in horizontal transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed bracovirus circles have been shown to enter cells of all tissues tested [51, 52] and to integrate into the DNA of lepidopteran host cells as a part of the wasp life cycle [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several components of the virus particles belong to the integrase family (VLF1, INT1, INT2) [53] and thus potentially mediate integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During parasitism, bracoviruses do not replicate in host tissues and therefore integration into host cell DNA may allow persistence of bracovirus DNA in lepidopteran larvae that continue to develop [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was previously shown that a side effect of this integration mechanism was to allow circle integration events back into germline cells of the wasp [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was indicated by the analysis of bracovirus sequences in Cotesia sesamiae genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, segments homologous to CcBV circle 10 were found in two different genomic locations in C. sesamiae strains of Kenya [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence comparison of circular and reintegrated viral forms [13, 26] indicated that circle integration likely involved the same mechanism as the one described for the integration of bracovirus circles into lepidopteran host genomic DNA during parasitism, using specific sites on the circle (the Host Integration Motifs) [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The occurrence of circle integration into lepidopteran host germline DNA resulting in sequence transfer between bracovirus and Lepidoptera is likely another consequence of this viral integration mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did not find integration of complete circles such as those described in the wasp genome, the largest Ben9 encoding region in Danaus plexippus corresponds to more than half of C25 sequence and has retained in this Lepidoptera the bracovirus organisation with two genes (RnaseT2 and Ben9) separated by non-coding sequences [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that bracovirus insertions correspond to remnants of circles integrated in Lepidoptera genomes that have been subject to many rearrangements since their integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed it is likely that after circle integration bracovirus sequences are lost, unless they provide a selective advantage to the insect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, identification of complete circles in genomes, corresponding to recently integrated sequences, not fixed in the species, might require more diverse template sources than the very limited number of individuals used for lepidopteran genome sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insertions described in this paper are most probably all ancient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Ben9 was already present in the common ancestor of the Danaina subtribe 5 MYA [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover evidence that rearrangements have occurred is provided by the comparison of the two Ben9 gene containing regions, one having conserved a larger part of the bracovirus non-coding sequence than the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insertion in the B. mori genome has also been obviously rearranged since a stretch of lepidopteran specific DNA separates bracovirus sequences in two parts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BV2-5, Se-BLL2 and SF2.5 insertions in Spodoptera spp correspond mostly to single genes, which could represent an ultimate stage of domestication, most of the sequence of the circle having been lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that a broader mechanism than virus-mediated integration, such as DNA repair, which is involved for example in transgenic mice production [54], might have resulted in the insertion of fragments of bracovirus circles in Lepidoptera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However it should be noted that in all cases described in this study the insertions correspond exclusively to sequences from bracovirus circles: we did not find any stretch of wasp sequence flanking or separating bracovirus DNA sequences in the lepidopteran genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus although integration of wasp DNA could be possible in theory, given that the wasp larvae develop within lepidopteran hosts, we did not search for, nor find evidence of wasp DNA (non-viral) integration in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of bracovirus sequences in lepidopteran genomes is apparently a paradox given that infected larvae are considered as an evolutionary dead-end (see Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, CcBV has been shown to induce alteration of host developmental programming resulting in inhibition of metamorphosis, even when experimentally injected in a lower amount than during wasp oviposition [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we found no evidence for HGT of CcBV genes in M. sexta, a common host of C. congregata but instead genes having similarities with other polyDNAviruses [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some host species might be less susceptible to the effect of bracoviruses on development or could have developed resistance mechanisms, and therefore live to tell the tale after parasitism and injection of particles (Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However we propose that the main route of bracovirus gene acquisitions by Lepidoptera could be through parasitoid wasp stinging of non-host species (Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the field, the host range of the wasp C. congregata corresponds to several species of sphingidae, but in laboratory conditions it was shown to oviposit in non-host species such as the noctuidae Trichoplusia ni [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such behaviour might offer the opportunity for bracovirus DNA to integrate into genomes of lepidopteran lineages that do not belong to the host range of bracovirus-associated wasps (such as species of the monarch lineage for example) and to escape bracovirus induced host development arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context the cellular machinery of Lepidoptera appear to be sufficiently conserved to express a bracovirus gene normally adapted for expression in a different lepidopteran family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the conservation of Ben9 and BV2-5 intron splicing in two different lepidopteran families (sphingid/nymphalids and sphingid/noctuids respectively, Fig 1, Fig 2), illustrates that these genes can be ready to be expressed even in non-target species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not recorded in the field to our knowledge, oviposition in non-hosts may happen since parasitoids, such as Cotesia species, attacking aggressive caterpillars do not have the time to intensively examine the potential host before oviposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rearing conditions, they sometimes lay their eggs into other adult wasps, which shows the lack of specificity in their choice [55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The BV genome is integrated in the wasp genome (in grey).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is composed of proviral segments (in blue) used to produce dsDNA circles (blue circles) packaged in nucleocapsids (grey cylinders) that encode virulence genes introduced into the host (coloured rectangles) and of BV genes that are involved in particle production (grey rectangles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter originate from a nudivirus and encode structural proteins, they are expressed in wasp ovaries where production of bracovirus circles also occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct Repeat Junctions (DRJ, red triangles) are involved in site-specific recombination allowing circularisation of linear molecules from proviral segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circles thus produced are packaged in BV particles that also contain several integrase proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The particles are injected in the lepidopteran host during wasp oviposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once in the host BV particles infect many lepidopteran cell types but do not replicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BV circles can integrate into lepidopteran host genomic DNA (in light blue) by a mechanism involving most likely an integrase and mediated by Host Integration Motifs (HIM) indicated by dark blue lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When injected into a regular host (1) BV virulence gene (coloured squares) expression leads to modifications in lepidopteran host physiology, such as inhibition of wasp egg encapsulation and alteration of developmental programming allowing wasp larvae to complete their development safely in the host body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothesis: when integration of viral circles occurs in the germline the integrated forms are not transmitted because the host dies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When bracoviruses are injected into a caterpillar, which is not a regular host species (2) or is a resistant host (interrupting oviposition, destroying wasp eggs, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the integrated viral form in germline DNA can be transmitted vertically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As bracovirus genes are adapted for expression in lepidopteran cells they can be readily domesticated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once integrated in lepidopteran genomes the bracovirus sequences undergo rearrangements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, after several million years, only the domesticated genes remain from the original integrated circle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that stinging of non-host species could be the main route for bracovirus sequence transfer to Lepidoptera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is based on the fact that the genome of M. sexta which is the regular host of Cotesia congregata does not contain genes acquired from CcBV, conversely genes found in Spodoptera exigua, which is not a host of Cotesia congregata, are more closely related to CcBV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This figure is mostly based on the life cycle of CcBV associated with C. congregata parasitoid wasp of M. sexta, HIM motifs have been identified in the bracovirus of M. demolitor, the picture of S. exigua is shown as an example of C. congregata non-host species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Conservation of bracovirus genes in lepidopteran genomes is likely associated with an increase in insect fitness due to the expression of the viral genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is sustained by functional studies with the SeBLL2 and BV2-5 proteins from S. exigua showing they have an impact on baculovirus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that host domestication of these bracoviral genes might increase insect protection to this natural pathogen playing a role in regulating population dynamics in the field [56, 57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have found that the interference of recombinant BV2-5 with the cellular cytoskeleton dynamics has a strong impact on the baculovirus producing this protein suggesting BV2-5 could confer larval protection against baculovirus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that an S. exigua BV2-5 bearing strain is less susceptible to baculovirus infection than the European population bearing the BV2-5 truncated form (S6 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However the genetic background between the two strains is probably different and other approaches such as the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to produce S. exigua lines by knocking out of BV2-5 or restoring the functional BV2-5 will be required to unambiguously demonstrate the protective function of this protein, after baculovirus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alteration of a fundamental cellular component such as cytoskeleton dynamics probably also induces a cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. exigua is a Palearctic species, which was introduced in America in 1876 probably from Europe [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that Lepidoptera now collected in Europe encode a truncated form of BV2-5 suggests that a recent mutation has spread in this population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that BV2-5-mediated baculovirus protection might induce a cost leading for example to increased susceptibility to other pathogens such as bacteria or parasitoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of one or the other form of BV2-5 might depend on the abundance and local selective pressure exerted by pathogens and/or parasites and the cost might also explain why BV2-5 has been lost in S. frugiperda while it was detected in S. litura a more recent species in the Spodoptera lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case BV2-5 coding sequence is more conserved than the other part of the bracovirus insertion suggesting the gene as Ben genes in the monarch is generally under conservative selection and not neutrally transmitted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to BV2-5, we have observed that another gene of bracovirus origin Se-BLL2 can also confer certain level of protection in experimental conditions against both viral forms of baculovirus, occluded derived virions (responsible of the primary infection) and budded viruses (responsible of the systemic infection of larvae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C-type lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins playing a range of functions in multiple organisms [59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, PDV lectins are able to specifically recognize carbohydrates on the surface of the endoparasitoid eggs and, thus, inhibit the recognition of the eggs by the lepidopteran host recognition proteins [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although little is known about the response of C-type lectins to viral invaders, crustacean lectins have been reported to be related to the antiviral defense [61, 62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In lepidopterans, the only example of antiviral response involving C-type lectins was reported by Chai et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments have shown that BLL2 action is interfering with the initial viral entrance into the Sf21 cells (Fig 8B and 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to these results, it is likely that antiviral action of Se-BLL2 is due to its interaction with viral or host cell membrane glycoproteins involved in viral binding and entrance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, additional studies will be needed to define the exact mode of action of BLL proteins as well as their possible role in the host interaction with viral and non-viral pathogens and parasitoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In any case it should be noted that the acquired genes do not confer a complete protection against baculovirus infection and our study confirm that S. exigua larvae are indeed susceptible to baculovirus infection (Fig 9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the literature the susceptibility of Spodoptera spp depend on many factors such as the larval stage [64], the type of plant hosting the insects [65], the geographical origin of the insects, and even on the midgut microbiota composition [66].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many individuals ingesting a sublethal dose of OBs can survive with a covert infection (larvae harbouring baculovirus but not displaying the disease symptoms) the incidence of which can be over 50% in the field for Spodoptera exigua [56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known on the molecular aspects of this phenomenon but BV2-5 effect on cytoskeleton dynamics could possibly contribute to this latency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together a large number of factors can modulate insect susceptibility and given the high incidence of baculovirus infection in the field being even only less susceptible can have a great impact at the population fitness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of a host-pathogen arms race any new trait that confers an advantage to any of the competitors is susceptible to be incorporated into the gene pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether our results strongly suggest that two acquired genes can confer an advantage against viral infection although the comprehensive analysis of the molecular function of the identified proteins is awaited and we cannot completely exclude at this stage that they could have other functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ben genes also probably have a role for the Lepidoptera since they have been maintained in different lineages and we have shown that in the monarch they are mostly under conservative selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have described in this report several insertions of bracovirus DNA sequences in a series of lepidopteran genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammals a few examples have been described of integrated retrovirus receptor genes conferring a specific protection against new infections by related viruses using the same cell entry mechanism [67, 68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, this concept of genes acquired and domesticated by hosts to protect against related virus infections has been shown to operate also for a Bornavirus (negative strand RNA virus) [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus resistance conferred by expression of viral genes in plants has also been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, transgenic plants expressing viral gene constructs can exhibit resistance to infection by the virus [70, 71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we extend this concept of an organism using pathogen genetic resources as a protection against other pathogens, to insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we show that domestication of different bracovirus genes most likely confers protection to Lepidoptera against baculoviruses, a common pathogen in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What is very original compared to previous reported cases is the use of viral sequences as a protection against a distantly related virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, most of the viral sequences inserted into host genomes that were hypothesized to confer a protection are effective against closely related viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protection mechanisms are based on the expression of defective proteins of viral origin that are able to interact with those of the pathogenic virus and thus interfere with cell entry [72], replication [73] or interfere by producing small RNAs inducing destruction of virus transcripts having highly similar sequences [74, 75].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since baculovirus infection of the host could be lethal for the parasitoid [76], it might be speculated that the function of some of the bracoviral genes domesticated by Lepidoptera was already to protect the parasitized larvae against baculovirus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might provide an explanation for both the unusual ability to interfere with distantly related virus infections and the fact that the bracovirus genes have conserved the same structure after their integration into Lepidoptera genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A specific bracovirus circle integration mechanism into lepidopteran host DNA operating during parasitism and resulting occasionally in circle reintegration into wasp genome has been previously characterized [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is likely involved in HGTs between Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera, although it is also possible that some of the sequences might have been integrated through DNA repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once integrated into lepidopteran genomes, bracovirus genes are readily domesticated by Lepidoptera since they are already adapted for expression in lepidopteran tissues during parasitism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed the majority of the CcBV genes expressed during parasitism were shown to possess an insect structure with an arthropod transcription start site, at least one intron and polyadenylation signals [22] and we showed here that the splicing machinery of different Lepidoptera families can produce the same mRNAs from a bracovirus gene containing introns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether the ability of bracoviruses to mediate integration, the fact that bracovirus gene structure is adapted to expression in Lepidoptera and that bracovirus circles have acquired different gene sets depending on the wasp lineage suggest we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg and that numerous cases of integration and domestication of bracovirus sequences will be identified with the exponential rise of genomic data provided by new generation sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus this phenomenon is not merely a curiosity but has most likely played an important role in the arms race between Lepidoptera and their pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Identification_of_bracovirus_insertions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequences sharing high similarity with Bracovirus sequences in lepidopteran genomes were identified using the 35 CcBV circles [18] as queries in megablast analysis (NCBI) against whole genome shotgun contig data banks (wgs at NCBI) restricted to lepidopteran genome sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the bioinformatic study which recently reported numerous short insertions of bracovirus sequences in lepidopteran genomes [31] we focused here on bracovirus-like sequences more than 1 kb long and encoding at least one gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A blast analysis between proviral integrated circle sequences and the different contigs identified was used to determine the precise location of high scoring pairs (HSP) reported in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HSP and annotated sequences were visualised using DNAPlotter [77].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homologous transcribed sequences were then searched for in the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) database at NCBI, for Spodoptera and Bombyx sequences (no data was found in TSA for Danaus plexippus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that although all the identified insertions are very closely related to CcBV since the donor circle can be identified in many cases, this does not necessarily indicate that C. congregata was the donor species since only a handful of bracovirus packaged genomes have been sequenced to date among those associated with the estimated 1200 species of the Cotesia genus [78].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Insects_used_for_experimental_confirmation_of_the_different_insertions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specimen of Danaina subtribe were kindly provided by David Smith.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were collected randomly in the field in the late 1990s, killed in ethyl ethanoate vapour immediately before storage in 95% ethanol [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were stored for 6 years at -20°C then for 9 years at room temperature (D. Smith, personal communication).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult D. plexippus were collected in Australia (voucher number, vn: 396), D. genutia in Thailand (vn: 430), D. chrysippus chrysippus in Oman (vn: 262), T. septentrionis septentrionis in Malay Peninsula (vn: 216).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, D. plexippus plexippus caterpillars were sampled in August 2012 in Valcartier, Canada (46°5652N, 71°2950W).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Four colonies of S. exigua, derived from different geographic locations, were continuously reared on artificial diet at 25± 3°C with 70±5% relative humidity and a photoperiod of 16h light: 8h dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FRA strain was supplied by M. Lopez-Ferber, (INRA St.Christol les Alés, France) [79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ALM strain was established from successive collections from southern Spain [80].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XEN-R strain was obtained from cotton fields in Pattville, AL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (USA) and was later selected for resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis [81, 82].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SUI population was provided by Andermatt Biocontrol AG (Grossdietwil, Switzerland).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA from the Mexican population was provided by P. Caballero (Universidad Publica de Navarra).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, DNA representing S. exigua from Japan was obtained from the cell line Se301 originally derived from insects collected in Japan (Hara, et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1995).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_extraction_and_PCR_analyses_of_insertions_in_Danaina_subtribe  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After grinding frozen samples in liquid nitrogen, DNAs from D. plexippus larvae were extracted by C. Béliveau using QiaAMP DNA mini kit (Qiagen) and were sent by M. Cusson (Québec, Canada).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For specimens of Danaina subtribe, 20 mg of tissues were dried at 37°C to eliminate ethanol, frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground with a pellet and a mortar previously refrigerated at -80°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was then extracted using the QiAmp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the suppliers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compensate for partial degradation of DNA from old samples, primers were designed for amplification of short fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 35-cycle PCR (94°C for 60 s; 50°C for 60 s; 72°C for 60 s) was performed with 10 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTP (MP Biochemicals), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 unit Goldstar (Eurogentec) and 20 ng of genomic DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR products (8 l) were run on 1.5% agarose gels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EF1 gene was used as a control of DNA sample quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful amplifications of Ben9 insertions (Fig 2) were obtained: for D. plexippus using primers Ben9 12F and Ben9 12R (176 bp fragment, S1 Table); for D. chrysippus and D. genutia using primers Ben9 13F and Ben9 13R (173 bp fragment); for and T. septentrionis using Ben9 14F and Ben9 14R (123 bp fragment); amplifications of Ben4 insertion (S1 Fig) was obtained using Ben4 2F and Ben4 2R (223 bp fragment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the PCR analyses did not allow us to discriminate between the two Ben9 insertions (Fig 1(A) and 1(B)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_extraction_and_gene_amplification_from_cDNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was isolated from 5th instar S. exigua larvae using RNAzol reagent (Molecular research centre, INC) as described in the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One g of each RNA was DNase treated (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA with oligo (dT) and hexamer primers using Super Script II Reverse Transcriptase from Invitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D. plexippus RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and sent by M. Cusson (Québec, Canada), it was further treated by rDNase (NucleoSpin RNA, Macherey-Nagel) to eliminate residual DNA until no PCR amplification of a control gene could be detected from the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For D. plexippus, a total of 1g of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with oligo (dT) primers using Super Script II reverse transcriptase or Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR amplifications from cDNA of the different genes were performed using standard protocols and specific primers (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the BV2-5 alleles, initial sequences were obtained from the transcriptome of S. exigua larvae exposed to different types of pathogens [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two primers flanking the coding sequence were designed and used to amplify this sequence from cDNAs originating from different populations and cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-PCR-amplified alleles of BV2-5 were directly sequenced or cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced using standard primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least two independent clones were sequenced for each insect population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measure_of_the_selection_pressures_operating_on_Danaus_plexippus_Ben4_and_Ben9_genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selection pressures operating on D. plexippus Ben4 and Ben9 genes were measured using Illumina data available at NCBI (SRA data bank) and corresponding to 80 individuals from different wild populations and 8 individuals from other Danaus species (D. erippus, D. chrysippus, D. eresimus, D. gilippus) [30] in order to identify molecular signatures that might be associated with particular selection pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reads from D. plexippus samples were mapped onto the reference genome of D. plexippus [30] with Bowtie2 (2.2.4) [83] using default parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ben regions were then extracted with Samtools [84].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A consensus sequence was obtained for each sample (minimum coverage of 5 reads and minimum frequency of a variant for the individual to be considered as heterozygote = 0.25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences with a missing base ratio above 50% due to heterogeneity in the sequencing were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads corresponding to the two Ben9 copies could not be separated due to high similarity, therefore Ben9 was analyzed as a single gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed de novo assembly of the reads from the other species using Velvet 1.2.07 [85] and a k-mer length of 31 and the Ben genes were identified by BLAST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the sequences were aligned using MAFFT [86], the sequences with a STOP codon were corrected in order to use them for the selection analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The global dN/dS () ratios was measured using two different methods, AnalyseCodonData implemented in HyPhy [87] and Codeml from PAML [88] with a means  ratio for all branches (model = 0) and one  value for all sites (NSsites = 0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the  ratio was measured for each site along the alignment, in order to identify regions with a particular selection signature, using the SLAC method implemented in HyPhy (significance thresold: p-value  0.1) and Codeml from PAML [88] with a means  ratio for all branches (model = 0) and selection model (NSsites = 2), which classify the sites into three classes ( = 0 neutral, 0less_thanless_than 1 under negative selection and 1 under positive selection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses were performed using the phylogeny based on genome wide SNP data [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phylogenetic tree shown in Fig 3 was built based on the common region of Ben4 and Ben9 using PHYML and substitution model HKY85 and 1000 bootstraps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genomic_sequence_of_the_BV2-5_and_Se-BLL2_regions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A universal genome walking kit (Clontech) was used for the sequencing of the whole integrated BV2-5 and Se-BLL2 contigs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, three S. exigua genomic DNA libraries [89] were subjected to primary and secondary PCRs using the general primers provided by the kit and specific primers designed to amplify 5 and 3 flanking regions of the BV2-5 and Se-BLL2 open reading frames (ORFs) (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplified fragments were purified, cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_expression_patterns_and_the_response_to_pathogens  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence and abundance of mRNA of Se-BV2-5 and Se-BLL2 in different larval tissues were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qPCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, total RNAs from fat body, midgut and hemocytes were isolated from untreated 5th instar larvae using the RNAzol reagent (Molecular research center, INC) as described in the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 1 g RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with oligo-(dT) primer using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDNAs were used to determine the level of transcripts for each gene by qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions were carried out using an ABI Prism 7700 thermocycler from Applied Biosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SYBR green Ex Taq master mix (Clontech) was employed in a total volume of 20 l. Specific primers for each gene were designed by Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems) (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each gene, at least three biological replicates were employed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are presented as fold change using the method of 2-Ct and normalized to the internal control gene, ATP synthase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of baculovirus infection on the expression pattern of the lectins in the larval midgut was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third instar larvae were orally infected with S. exigua nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each larva was fed with 104 occlusion bodies (OBs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Midguts of treated and untreated larvae were collected 72 h after treatment [66].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA from the treated and control larvae were collected as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDNA was reverse-transcribed and the presence and abundance of the mRNA was determined using qPCR as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_recombinant_baculovirus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The full ORF of the two main allelic forms of BV2-5 (complete and truncated) were amplified by PCR from cDNA obtained from S. exigua FRA and Xen-R larvae, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were cloned into pFBD-pH vector, downstream of the p10 promoter to generate pFBD-pH-BV2-5 (for the complete form) and pFBD-pH-BV2-5t (for the truncated form) vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pFBD-pH refers to the dual vector pFBD (Clontech) containing the AcMNPV polyhedrin gene downstream of the PH promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to generate recombinant baculoviruses, Escherichia coli strain DH10Bac that contains the AcMNPV CC bacmid [90] and the pMON7124 helper plasmid [91] was transformed with pFBD-pH-BV2-5, pFBD-pH-BV2-5t, or pFBD-pH plasmids according to a standard procedure described for the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant bacmids were selected based on white-blue screening of DH10Bac colonies and the positive clones were confirmed by PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacmid DNAs were isolated from bacterial cells according to standard procedure and used to transfect S. frugiperda ovary-derived cell line Sf21 using Insect Gene Juice Transfection Reagent (Novagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four to six days post transfection, the recombinant CC-pH, CC-pH-BV2-5 and CC-pH-BV2-5t bacmid-derived viruses were collected and multiplied to produce high-titer stocks for further experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another type of construct was generated to study the cellular localization of BV2-5 by expressing this protein fused to GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers containing BglII and EcoRI were designed to amplify the BV2-5 gene from the pFBD-pH_BV2-5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained fragment was sub-cloned into pGEM-T Easy, double digested with BglII and EcoRI, and cloned in p166AcV5-Se8-GFP [92] in order to obtain the fusion gene BV2-5_GFP in the plasmid p166AcV5-Se8-BV2-5GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the GFP gene and the recombinant BV2-5GFP gene were amplified using specific primers that contained the NotI and PstI restriction sites (Forward BV2-5GFP: 5 TTGCGGCCGCATGTTGCCTATTACC3; Forward GFP: 5 CTGCGGCCGCATGGGCAAAGGAGAAGAACTTT3; Reverse: 5AGCTGCAGTTACGACCAGCCGCCGCTGGCATCT3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both genes were cloned under the ph promoter of pFBD to generate pFBD-GFP and pFBD-BV2-5GFP, which were used to transpose into the AcMNPV bacmid as previously described (S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cellular_localization_of_the_BV2-5_protein_by_confocal_microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cellular localization of the BV2-5 protein was determined using the recombinant baculovirus expressing BV2-5 fused to GFP (AcMNPV-BV2-5GFP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously to the confocal analysis, Sf21 cells were maintained in Graces medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin at 27°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first set of cells was infected with AcMNPV-BV2-5 GFP and a second set with AcMNPV-GFP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third set of cells was infected with AcMNPV-GFP and treated with 5 M latrunculin A (Sigma Aldrich) 12 hours post infection (hpi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fourth group of cells was maintained without any treatment as a negative control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventy-two hpi, cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min at 3000xg and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the cells were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS-BSA 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After another step of PBS washing, cellular actin was stained overnight at 4°C with phalloidin-tetramethylrhodamine B isocyanate TRITC (Sigma Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the cells were washed, stained with DAPI (4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to visualize the nucleus of cells and fixed by dakocytomation fluorescent mounting medium (Dakocytomation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mounted cells were observed under confocal microscope (FV1000, OLYMPUS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_BV2-5_on_baculovirus_multiplication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effect of BV2-5 on baculovirus multiplication in cell culture was determined by a one-step growth curve assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sf21 cells were infected with the different recombinant baculoviruses at an MOI of 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After infection, cells were washed and incubated in fresh medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At different time points, an aliquot of medium was harvested and the viral titer (amount of budded viruses) in each sample was determined by qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For that purpose, viral DNAs were extracted using Prepman reagent (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer protocol and were quantified by comparing the obtained Ct values against a standard curve of known viral concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three independent replicates were performed for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Insect_bioassay_and_effect_of_Se-BLL2_on_susceptibility_to_baculovirus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recombinant Se-BLL2 was expressed and produced in an Escherichia coli expression system and purified with affinity chromatography using the HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to test the effect of BLL2 on baculovirus infection, the purified protein was added in different concentrations (50 g/mL, 10 g/mL, and 1g/mL) to AcMNPV-GFP virions in presence of 10mM CaCl2 and the mixture was incubated for 2 hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After that, the mixture of virus-lectin was then used to infect Sf21 cells (MOI of 0.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, other sets of cells were infected with AcMNPV-GFP or AcMNPV-GFP incubated with 10 mM CaCl2 as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirty-six hours post infection, percentage of cells showing GFP was determined for the different treatments in order to compare the virus entry to cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, an aliquot of the medium was harvested at different time points, and the virus titer was determined for each sample and time point by qPCR as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
S. exigua third instar larvae were infected with Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) by the drop-feeding method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Occlusion bodies (OBs) (5x105) from SeMNPV were added to a solution containing sucrose and phenol red colorant (10% and 0.05%, respectively) in presence or absence of purified Se-BLL2 (0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15mg/mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larvae were allowed to drink from the virus and control solution in Petri dishes and then transferred individually to the assay plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mortality was then recorded every 12 h until death or pupation of all the larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sixteen larvae were used for each treatment and three independent replicates were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mortality was expressed as the percentage of dead larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time to death was assessed by comparing the mortality curves using the Kaplan Meier method (GraphPad Prism 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical significance was determined using the log-rank analysis (Mantel-cox test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insect bioassays comparing susceptibility to SeMNPV in two different populations (SUI and MEX) of S.exigua were performed as described above at a final dose of 103 OBs/larva.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_analysis_of_BV2-5_and_lectin_sequences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The putative ORFs were determined with the EditSeq program from DNASTAR and the homologs in other insect species were obtained using BLAST comparison at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nhi.gov), Silkbase (http://silkworm.genomics.org.cn), Manduca sexta genome project (http://agripestbase.org/manduca) and LepidoDB (http://www6.inra.fr/lepidodb).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted amino acid sequences were aligned using the ClustalX software [93] and visualized in GenDoc program [94].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolutionary distance was calculated for aligned sequences by Maximum-likelihood method and the phylogenetic trees were conducted with the MEGA5 program [95].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reliability of an inferred tree was determined using bootstrap test (1000 replicates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a clearer view of the branches, bootstrap values are reported over 100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
