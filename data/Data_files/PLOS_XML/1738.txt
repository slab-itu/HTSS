Reduced accumulation of defective viral genomes contributes to severe outcome in influenza virus infected patients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can be severe or even lethal in toddlers, the elderly and patients with certain medical conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection of apparently healthy individuals nonetheless accounts for many severe disease cases and deaths, suggesting that viruses with increased pathogenicity co-circulate with pandemic or epidemic viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Looking for potential virulence factors, we have identified a polymerase PA D529N mutation detected in a fatal IAV case, whose introduction into two different recombinant virus backbones, led to reduced defective viral genomes (DVGs) production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutation conferred low induction of antiviral response in infected cells and increased pathogenesis in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze the association between low DVGs production and pathogenesis in humans, we performed a genomic analysis of viruses isolated from a cohort of previously healthy individuals who suffered highly severe IAV infection requiring admission to Intensive Care Unit and patients with fatal outcome who additionally showed underlying medical conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These viruses were compared with those isolated from a cohort of mild IAV patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viruses with fewer DVGs accumulation were observed in patients with highly severe/fatal outcome than in those with mild disease, suggesting that low DVGs abundance constitutes a new virulence pathogenic marker in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Influenza A viruses are the causative agents of annual epidemics, sporadic zoonotic outbreaks and occasionally pandemics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Worldwide, acute respiratory infections caused by influenza A viruses continue to be one of the main causes of acute illness and death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance in 2009 of a new H1N1 pandemic influenza strain reinforced the search to identify viral pathogenicity determinants for evaluation of the consequences of virus epidemics and potential pandemics for human health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify a new general virulence determinant found in a cohort of severe/fatal influenza virus-infected patients, a reduced accumulation of viral defective genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These molecules are incomplete viral genome segments that activate the innate immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This data will contribute to the prediction of influenza disease severity, to improved guidance of patient treatment and will enable the development of risk-based prevention strategies and policies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Acute respiratory infections are a main cause of severe illness and death worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Influenza A virus (IAV) causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics with potentially fatal outcome [1]; the global burden of seasonal influenza is  greater than 600 million cases, with 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths each year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual influenza epidemics affect all age groups, although infants, the elderly, and individuals with underlying medical conditions are most severely affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of co-morbid conditions and the immune status may contribute to the patient outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comorbid conditions for influenza include diabetes, chronic metabolic of lung, renal and cardiac diseases, immunosuppression, pregnancy and obesity [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although comorbidities are found in many severe or even fatal cases, a considerable number of apparently healthy individuals nonetheless suffer severe infection, which suggests the coexistence of influenza strains with increased virulence among circulating viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously tested this hypothesis by characterizing two IAV strains from the AH1N1 2009 pandemic (AH1N1pdm09), one isolated from a fatal case in a person with no known previously described comorbidities (F-IAV, fatal-case IAV) and the other from a patient with mild symptoms (M-IAV, mild-case IAV) [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F-IAV virulence was greater than that of M-IAV in cell culture, and showed higher pathogenicity in the in vivo murine model [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IAV virulence and pathogenesis are dependent on complex, multigenic mechanisms involving the viral genetic characteristics, the host conditions, the virus-host interactions, and the host response to the infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Special effort has been previously made to identify virulence determinants of AH1N1pdm09 viruses and AH1N1 seasonal viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, some residues distributed all over the genome have been associated to increased virulence of specific viral isolates [6, 7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These determinants map mainly to the polymerase genes (PB1, PB2, PA), the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) (reviewed in [8]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attenuating factors have also been described in cell culture [9, 10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A proportion of influenza virus particles have defective genome RNAs (DVGs) due to internal deletions of viral segments [1114].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DVGs have the 3 and 5 ends of the parental RNA segments, and most have a single, large central deletion that generates viral RNAs of 1801000 nucleotides [1517].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DVGs have been found for all viral segments, but most derive from PB2, PB1 and PA RNAs [15, 17, 18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of DVGs potentiates the host response in cultured cells [19, 20] and in animal models and leads to attenuated infection [21], possibly through recognition of double-stranded RNA by receptors that activate antiviral signaling cascades [19] (reviewed in [22]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our understanding of influenza pathogenesis is considerable, a potential general virulence determinant in humans remains to be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to evaluate the role of defective genomes in the pathogenicity of influenza virus circulating in the human population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the low amount of DVGs accumulated in tissue culture cells correlates with increased pathogenicity in mice both, in natural isolates or recombinant viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To corroborate these findings we performed a genomic analysis of viruses isolated from respiratory samples of a select cohort of IAV A(H1N1)pdm09-infected patients who suffered severe or fatal outcome, or from a cohort of infected patients with mild disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former viruses showed significantly less accumulation of DVGs than the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that low DVGs abundance has a major role in the severe outcome of IAV-infected patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Virulence_and_pathogenicity_of_F-_and_M-IAV_correlate_with_DVGs_abundance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously characterized two virus isolates, the F-IAV derived from a fatal case in a young person with no known previously described comorbidities and the M-IAV, from a young patient with mild symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Specific_mutations_in_the_polymerase_of_a_fatal-case_virus_determine_DVGs_accumulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison of the F- and M-IAV consensus sequences showed nine amino acid changes in the F isolate [5] taken the A/California/04/2009 strain as reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in the viral polymerase PA (D529N) and PB2 (A221T) subunits and the surface glycoprotein HA (S127L) found in less_than1% of viruses circulating during 2009 influenza season were considered specific and potentially responsible for the difference in virulence [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since DVGs are mainly produced by the viral polymerase, PA D529N and PB2 A 221T changes in the polymerase subunits were selected as putative responsible for low DVGs production and increased pathogenicity of F-IAV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further characterize the role of mutations in the F-IAV polymerase subunits as virulence determinants, we generated on the A/H1N1/California/04/09 virus backbone (CAL), recombinant influenza viruses bearing the combination of PA D529N and PB2 A221T mutations (PB2/PA mut; F-IAV-like polymerase), or viruses bearing single PA D529N (PA mut) or PB2 A221T (PB2 mut) mutations (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These viruses were grown in cell culture at a low moi (0.0001) to limit the production of DVGs and viruses obtained from this passage were used for the following assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The activity of the reconstituted polymerases of these three mutant viruses and the wild-type virus was first evaluated in a mini-replicon assay, which showed not significant differences (Fig 4A and 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, growth kinetics in cell culture showed that all recombinant viruses accumulates similar levels of viral proteins in a single cycle replication assay (Fig 4C) and replicated at a similar rate in a multiple cycle assay (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Correlation_between_DVGs_accumulation_and_in_vivo_pathogenicity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the pathogenesis induced by the different recombinant viruses carrying mutations present in F-IAV, we infected mice with various virus doses of CAL, PB2 mut, PA mut or PB2/PA mut viruses or with DMEM as control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survival (Fig 7A) and body weight (S9 Fig) were monitored daily for two weeks and the lethal dose 50 (LD50) for each virus was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAL, PB2 mut, PA mut and PB2/PA mut viruses showed an LD50 of 1x105,  greater than 106, 3 x 103 and 3.5 x 104, respectively (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data confirmed that CAL virus is pathogenic in mice [1] and indicated that the PA D529N mutation greatly increased pathogenicity, suggesting a decisive effect of this polymerase change on disease outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PB2 mut, which accumulates high DVG levels, was greatly attenuated compared with the CAL virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reconstitution of the F-like polymerase-containing virus (PB2/PA mut) notably reduced DVGs accumulation (Fig 5A) and led to higher pathogenicity compared with PB2 mut virus (Fig 7A and 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We additionally evaluated the pathogenicity of M mut and M-PA mut viruses in the same way indicated above and the results show that the introduction of the M1+M2 mutations on the CAL wt or PA mut backgrounds led to clear virus attenuation in mice, as the LD50 increased from 1 x 105 or 3 x 103, respectively, to  greater than 5 x 105 in both cases (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M-PA mut virus pathogenicity was greater than that of M mut virus, as indicated by body weight loss after sublethal infection (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further evaluate the pathogenicity differences among viruses bearing mutations present in F-IAV, mice were infected with a sub-lethal dose (103 pfu) of recombinant mutant viruses, or were mock-infected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were recovered at several days post-infection (dpi) and viral titers determined in lung (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PA mut-infected mice showed the highest titers at 1, 2, and 4 dpi and the most rapid virus replication kinetics, whereas PB2 mut-infected mice showed the lowest titers at all times tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Low_number_of_DVGs_is_associated_with_severe_or_fatal_outcome_in_humans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we wanted to examine whether accumulation of DVGs play a role in the pathogenicity of influenza viruses in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deep-sequencing of RNA from viruses isolated from respiratory samples of a select cohort of A(H1N1)pdm09-like virus-infected patients was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cohort includes patients with highly severe outcome including severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with mechanical ventilation and endotracheal intubation for more than 96 hours (Fig 9A) from 20122013 influenza season in Spain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For more precise characterization of the intrinsic pathogenicity of these viruses, only those isolated from patients with no known comorbidities and aged under 65 and over 4 were included (Fig 9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cohort (n = 4) is a faithful representation (80100%) of the total confirmed severe H1N1 influenza cases following these criteria in the 20122013 Spanish influenza season (n = 45) (S2 Table) [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, two viruses isolated from deceased patients who accomplished these criteria, but otherwise showed underlying medical conditions were evaluated; total severe/fatal cohort n = 6 (Fig 9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These viruses were compared to those isolated from a cohort (n = 6) of mild IAV patients detected through the regular influenza surveillance system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Influenza virus pathogenicity has been studied in depth for many years, and several amino acid changes have been identified as virulence determinants [1, 68, 32], however, a general pathogenicity determinant has not been characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although DVGs have been described in natural animal infections [33, 34] and in pandemic AH1N1pdm09- and other respiratory virus-infected individuals [35, 36] their role in viral pathogenicity in patients has not been evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation between DVGs accumulation and severe disease observed in the severe/fatal- and mild-case viruses isolated from respiratory samples suggests that DVGs generation is a critical feature of severe influenza virus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this hypothesis genetically by analyzing recombinant viruses bearing mutations identified in a fatal-outcome virus (F-IAV, mutations PB2 A221T and PA D529N) [5] or described elsewhere (mutations M1 S30N + M2 V86S) [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the non-pathogenic mutation PB2 A221T accumulates high levels of DVGs in cultured cells and is attenuated in mice (PB2 mut versus CAL), mutation PA D529N reduces DVGs accumulation alone or in combination with PB2 A221T change (Fig 5A) or with M1 S30N + M2 V86 S mutations (M-PA mut versus M mut) (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, recombinant viruses carrying PA D529N mutation displayed increased viral pathogenicity in the infected mice (PB2/PA mut and PA mut) (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selection criteria used for determination of putative virulent markers found in 2009 in F-IAV has been updated, and the prevalence of these changes in H1N1 viruses circulating in humans was calculated using all sequences available in the NCBI Influenza Resource database from December 2009 to March 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis showed that PA D529N change continues to be a rare mutation specific of F-IAV, but PB2 221 position admitted several changes including T. This data indicates that at position 221 of PB2 changes have been established in addition to the original A in the further circulating viruses after the influenza 2009 pandemic and this position might not be relevant for the increased pathogenicity of the F-IAV (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This data correlates with our findings, which indicate that PB2 A221T change is not responsible for the increased pathogenicity of the F-IAV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we adopted a highly restrictive approach to evaluate the potential role of DVGs accumulation as a determinant of severe influenza disease in humans, although a contribution of the immune status of the patient to the infection outcome cannot be excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed influenza viruses from a select cohort of patients, under 65 years and over 4 years of age, who suffered severe or fatal influenza infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These viruses were compared with those obtained from a cohort of mild infected patients detected through the regular surveillance system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deep sequencing identified an inverse correlation between DVGs accumulation and virus pathogenicity in these cohorts (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those patients with no known comorbidities infected with low DVGs producer viruses developed a severe outcome, and those who showed comorbid conditions eventually died, indicating that both factors may contribute to the fatal outcome of the infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The later data is in agreement with our previous study where we found that, besides being infected with the virulent F-IAV, which accumulates a reduced amount of DVGs, the infected patient presented a new confirmed genetic risk factor, a truncated form of Ccr5 gene [37, 38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, both the high virulence of the infecting virus, and the genetic risk factor, may have contributed to the fatal outcome of the patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
None of the severe/fatal cohort viruses bore PA D529N change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggest that low DVGs accumulation in severe/fatal-case viruses might be mediated by various changes other than D529N in PA polymerase subunit, or in distinct polymerase subunits (S3 Table), or in several viral proteins; this coincides with the complex, multigenic nature of the pathogenesis mechanisms [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actually, changes in the polymerase [9] and in NS2 protein [10] modulate DVGs production in cell culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations in M1 and M2 [20] also modulate DVGs accumulation, probably by altering DVGs encapsidation in progeny virions [39, 40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, reduced accumulation of DVGs constitutes a virulent factor itself, regardless the mutations responsible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regarding the possible mechanism of PA in low DVGs production, colleagues E. Fodor and G. Brownlee described some years ago that mutation A638R in the PA subunit was involved in the enormous accumulation of DGs in cell culture [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was there described that this high DGs generation was due to an elongation defect by destabilization of RNA-PA subunit interaction, and that this phenomenon could be reverted by another mutation in the same PA polymerase subunit (C453R).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors proposed a putative domain involved in elongation activity in the PA-C part of this polymerase subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have localized PAD529N mutation in the viral polymerase structure (S14 Fig) [54], and they are spatially in the same PA-C domain nearby these previously described mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This data suggests that PA D529N may be involved in the same elongation process, although this activity would need to be further explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Influenza A virus polymerase exists in different oligomerization state [55, 56], which allows different assembly of polymerase monomers during replication [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A new proposed mechanism suggests that the RNA depending RNA polymerase (vRdRP) dimer bound to viral RNA recruits another free polymerase dimer to form transient tetramer, which initiates replication of viral genome [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PA D529N mutation localizes on the interaction surface of this proposed dimerization model of the viral polymerase (S15 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these data suggest that this mutation (or other mutations on this same area) may alter the possible polymerase dimerization or, it may modify the stability of the RNA- polymerase complex, or additionally it may change the interaction with any cellular required factor, or any combination of them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The role of DVGs in inducing the innate immune response has been demonstrated in cell culture [19] and animal models [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in several animal models have led to proposals for the use of DG molecules or viruses modified to generate them in large numbers as protective elements against influenza virus infection [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be likely that the reduced activation of the antiviral state of cells infected with low DVGs producer viruses might induce an impaired immune response in infected animals or patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initially reduced antiviral state of the infected cells (Figs 3 and 6C) may allow the virus to grow uncontrolled for a short time and then this would induce an exacerbated immune response and inflammation which was described for severe IAV infected patients in the 2009 pandemic [42, 43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In viral infections, neutrophils and alveolar macrophages play a key role in clearance and control of viral growth in infected lungs, thus their substantial migration to the site of inflammation in infected tissue contributes to overall viral pathogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of alveolar macrophages leads to an uncontrolled viral proliferation and fatal outcome in infected mice [30, 44] while high influx of neutrophils in lungs and excessive inflammation has been associated with severe illness and high mortality rate in influenza infection [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depletion of alveolar macrophages perfectly correlates with increased viral titers in lung tissue of PA mut and PB2/PA mut infected animals (Fig 8A and 8C), emphasizing again the crucial role of these cells in viral clearance and control of viral growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, an increased influx of neutrophils, which is associated with lethal influenza virus infection [29], has been observed in recombinant viruses carrying a mutation (PA mut and PB2/PA mut) (Fig 8B) present in a fatal-case virus, which produce reduced amount of DVGs (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although DVGs are produced in the polymerase segments (PB1, PB2 and PA), as previously described [13, 18], most viruses studied here also generate DVGs in other segments (Figs 5B and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of DVGs of the different cohorts is interestingly observed in some distinct viral segments, which is specially reduced (23-fold) for the polymerase subunits segments in the severe/fatalassociated case viruses compared to viruses isolated from mild cases (Fig 10 and S13 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the genomic combination of DVGs produced by each virus, and not only absolute numbers, may also contribute to pathogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we establish a significant association between low DVGs accumulation and an increase in severe or fatal outcome in human influenza virus infection (Fig 9); we provide genetic support for this association in infected cultured cells and in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the previous reports about the role of DVGs in natural animal infections here we present data indicating that a reduced accumulation of DVGs may be considered a new virulence marker for viral pathogenicity in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluation of DVGs phenotype of circulating viruses might predict its potential to induce severe disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional work is needed to define specific DVGs function and the mechanism by which they are produced in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data could contribute substantially to the prediction of influenza disease severity and enable the development of risk-based prevention strategies and policies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ethics_statement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All procedures that required the use of animals complied with Spanish and European legislation concerning vivisection and the use of genetically modified organisms, and the protocols were approved by the National Center for Biotechnology Ethics Committees on Animal Experimentation and the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) Bioethics Subcommittee (permit 11014).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We followed the guidelines included in the current Spanish legislation on protection for animals used in research and other scientific aims (RD 53/2013) and the current European Union Directive 2014/11/EU on protection for animals used in experimentation and other scientific aims.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The National Influenza Center in Madrid (Instituto de Salud Carlos III) and other regional laboratories from different Spanish regions, constituted the ReLEG network included in the Spanish Influenza Surveillance System (SISS), which monitored the circulation of influenza viruses each influenza season as a part of the countrywide surveillance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The viruses described in this study have been detected within this surveillance activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An informed consent is not needed for this study since the patients from whom these viruses were isolated were anonymized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biosafety  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell culture and mouse model experiments performed with recombinant viruses bearing mutations detected in a fatal case of IAV were performed in BSL2+ conditions and in a biological insulator in BSL2+ animal facilities, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biological_materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell lines used in this study were canine kidney MDCK (ATCC), human lung epithelium A549 (ATCC) [45] and human embryonic kidney HEK293T (ATCC) cells [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Clinical_viral_isolates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Viruses used in the present study were selected according to the following criteria for the patients from whom the viruses were isolated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients included in the severe/fatal cohort were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 confirmed cases, aged over 4 and under 65, admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and with the information related to risk factors reflected in their clinical history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those patients who developed highly severe disease did not display any comorbidities associated to severe influenza A virus infection, and deceased patients presented some comorbid conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mild patients were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 confirmed cases, aged over 4 and under 65, who developed mild disease and were monitored by sentinel medical centers included in the Spanish National Influenza Surveillance System.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection of cases for this mild cohort was randomly made within the patients who meet the described above criteria and whose isolated virus were from the same Saint-Petersburg phylogenetic lineage as those from the severe/fatal cohort, accordingly to their HA gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Respiratory samples were collected in virus transport medium (MEM, 200 U/ml penicillin, 200 g/ml streptomycin, 200 U/ml mycostatin and 0.25% bovine serum albumin fraction V) and delivered to the Spanish National Influenza Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All influenza A viruses were isolated at the National Influenza Centre (CNM, ISCIII) from respiratory samples sent for virological characterization by the Spanish Influenza Surveillance System (SISS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The National Influenza Center in Madrid and other regional laboratories constitute the ReLEG network of the SISS, which monitors virus circulation each influenza season as a part of the countrywide surveillance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All viruses from either mild or severe/fatal patients were isolated from the upper respiratory tract, pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal exudates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Semi-confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were used for primary viral isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monolayers were inoculated with 200 l of homogenized samples; when the cytopathic effect was 75100%, cultures were harvested and the supernatants used for virus stock generation by inoculation of MDCK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mutagenesis_of_pCAGGs-PB2_and_PA_plasmids_derived_from_CAL_04_09  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specific mutations were engineered in expression pCAGGS plasmids derived from the CAL strain using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These materials were developed using the Licensed technology (Kawaoka-P99264US Recombinant Influenza viruses for vaccines and gene therapy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Minireplicon_assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recombinant minireplicon assay was performed essentially as described [47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, cultures of HEK293T cells (2.5 × 106 cells) were transfected with a mixture of plasmids expressing the RNP components (pCMVPA, 2.5 ng; pCMVPB1, 12.5 ng; pCMVPB2, 12.5 ng; and pCMVNP, 500 ng) and a genomic plasmid expressing a viral RNA (vRNA)-like chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene (pHHCAT, 500 ng) using the calcium phosphate technique [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 20 h posttransfection, total cell extracts were prepared and CAT accumulation determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; GE Healthcare), using purified CAT enzyme as a standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_recombinant_influenza_viruses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specific mutations were engineered in recombinant virus genomic pHH plasmids derived from the A/H1N1/California/04/2009 strain using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These materials were developed using the Licensed technology (Ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kawaoka-P99264US Recombinant Influenza viruses for vaccines and gene therapy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutations were rescued into infectious virus by standard techniques [49, 50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, to rescue infectious virus from cDNAs, 105 293T HEK cells were cotransfected with a mixture of 12 plasmid DNAs (100 ng each) including (i) 8 genomic plasmids each carrying a viral segment cDNA under the control of the polI promoter and (ii) 4 expression plasmids encoding the three polymerase subunits and the NP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfection was carried out at with Lipofectamine Plus (Gibco) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 16 h post-transfection, transfected cells were plated onto an excess of MDCK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a cytopathic effect was apparent, the supernatant medium was collected and used for plaque assay on MDCK cells to estimate viral titer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was used to produce a viral stock at low multiplicity of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identity of rescued mutant viruses was ascertained by sequencing of DNAs derived from the PA and PB2 RNA segments by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Supernatants of harvested cells inoculated with clinical samples or transfected with plasmids for the generation of recombinant viruses were titred by standard plaque assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These first passages of every virus were used to inoculate fresh MDCK cells at indicated controlled low multiplicity of infection (0.0001 moi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All viral stocks used for further studies had a viral titer about 107 pfu/ml.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Virion_purification_and_RNA_isolation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For virus purification, culture supernatants of 104 moi-infected MDCK cells were centrifuged (10 min, 3110 g, 4°C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants were sedimented through a sucrose step gradient (TNE buffer; 50% and 33% sucrose in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) (1 h, 274000 g, 4°C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 50 to 33% interphase was collected, diluted in TNE buffer, and pelleted through a cushion of 33% sucrose in TNE (2 h, 112000 g, 4°C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For purification of viruses isolated from infected mouse lung, the previous protocol was used with modification of the sucrose gradient volume and rotors according to sample volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For isolation, RNA in purified virions was treated with 0.5% SDS and 200g/ml proteinase K in TNE (2 h, 37°C), followed by extraction with phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol-hydroxyquinolein and ethanol precipitation [51].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was removed by DNAse treatment (Roche) according to manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quality and quantity of each RNA preparation was monitored using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) (S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Appropriate amounts of each sample were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_blotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the detection of viral and cellular proteins, total cell extracts were collected and Western blot assays were performed as described [49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies to GAPDH, -actin (both from Sigma), ISG56, Mx1 (both from Santa Cruz), NP and PB1 [57] were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Deep_sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequencing for previously described F- and M-IAV isolated during the 20092010 [5] influenza season was performed with the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx using Illumina v5 sequencing chemistry and 36 bp single reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Base calling was performed using Illumina pipeline version 1.7.0 (within SCS 2.8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other viruses were sequenced with TruSeq v3 chemistry and 50 bp single reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total reads in each sample are indicated in S1 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Deep_sequencing_data_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DVGs_detection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RT-PCR for the PA or PB2 segments was used to determine the presence of DVGs and their relative amount to the full-length RNA of the same viral segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect full-length segments, internal primers were used to amplify a central fragment, which is not present in DVGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect DVGs, the same RNA sample and external primers of the PA segment were used in a separate reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Short amplification times were applied for the detection of both, internal fragment corresponding to full-length segment and DVGs, to allow detection of RNAs up to 1000nt in length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method is illustrated in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reverse transcription reaction was performed for 30 min (42°C), followed by PCR (35 rounds at 94°C for 30 s, 53°/58°C for 40 s, and 68°C for 40 sec using the Titan-One RT-PCR kit (Roche)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a specificity control, the primers and RT-PCR conditions for DVGs amplification were used with a plasmid encoding the full-length PA segment, and no amplification product was obtained (S1A Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, primers and amplification conditions for internal fragment corresponding to full-length segment were used with purified DVGs, and no amplification product was obtained (S1A Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cloning_and_sequencing_of_DVGs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DVGs from cell cultured purified virions and from infected mice lung tissues were amplified by RT-PCR (Titan-One RT-PCR kit, Roche) as indicated above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obtained products were amplified with Taq Polymerase (Sigma) for further cloning into pGEM-T vector using pGEM-T Easy kit (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selected clones were sequenced by Sanger method and obtained sequences were analyzed to confirm that they corresponded to defective genomes, including the 3and 5ends and a large internal deletion of the full-length viral segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Virus_infections_in_cell_culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cultured human lung alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were infected at 103 pfu/cell (low multiplicity of infection; moi) or 3 pfu/cell (high moi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1 h, non-bound virus was rinsed off with acidic PBS (pH 5.3) and at various times (hours post-infection; hpi), cell supernatants were collected and used for virus titration by plaque assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_vivo_virus_infections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate pathogenicity of the viruses, 5 female BALB/c AnNHsd mice (67 weeks old) were infected intranasally with different doses (106102) of each of the recombinant influenza viruses described here, or were mock-infected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animals were monitored daily for clinical signs and body weights for two weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ethical reasons, mice were euthanized when they presented 25% body weight loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the kinetics experiment, 5 female BALB/c mice (67 weeks old) were infected intranasally with a sublethal dose (103 pfu/50l DMEM) of recombinant PA mut, PB2 mut or PB2/PA mut influenza viruses, or were mock-infected (50l DMEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were euthanized at 1, 2, 4 and 7 dpi by CO2 inhalation and necropsied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Viral_titer_estimation_in_extracted_organs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lung samples were homogenized in PBS-0.3%-BSA-penicillin/ streptomycin (100 IU/ml) using an Electronic Douncer (IKA T10 basic, Workcenter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lung samples were homogenized 1min at max speed at 4°C and debris was pelleted by centrifugation (2000 g, 5 min, 4°C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral titer was determined by standard plaque assay on MDCK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_lung_cell_suspension  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lungs samples were kept in RMPI medium at 4°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue samples were grinded into very small pieces prior to digestion with 180 g/ml liberase (Roche) and 40 g/ml DNase I (Roche) in RMPI medium for 30 minutes at 37°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Digested fragments were filtrated with 40mm Nylon Cell Strainer (BD Falcon) and resuspended with RMPI- 3%FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After centrifugation of samples (1640 rmp, 5 min, 4°C) additional step for erythrocyte lysis were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell pellet was incubated for 1.52 min with 1ml of erythrocyte lysis buffer at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysis is inhibited by adding 9ml of PBS-5mM EDTA-3%FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were then filtrated again with 40mm Nylon Cell Strainer and pelleted by centrifugation (1640rpm, 5 min, 4°C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flow_cytometry_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell suspensions were distributed in 96 wells plate and first incubated with violet LIVE/ DEAD due (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4°C, washed 2 twice with PBS and then incubated for 15 min at 4°C with Fc block CD16 rat antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were analysed by staining cell suspension with one or more fluorochrome-labelled antibodies mix in PBS for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies used were PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated CD45 (clon 30-F11) (BioLegend), PeCy7-conjugated CD11b (clon M1/70) (BioLegend), APC-conjugated CD11c (clon N418) (eBIOSCIENCE) and PE-conjugated Ly6G (clon 1A8) (BDBIOSCIENCE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were than fixed by incubation with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min, pelleted by centrifugation (700 rmp, 5 min, 4°C) and washed once with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After centrifugation (700 rmp, 5 min, 4°C), cells were resuspended in 0.4ml PBS and kept at 4°C O/N in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a cytometer LSR II (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed using CellQuestPro software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histopathology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animal lungs were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sliced into 5 mm thick sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) by conventional methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
