Composing only by thought: Novel application of the P300 brain-computer interface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The P300 event-related potential is a well-known pattern in the electroencephalogram (EEG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This kind of brain signal is used for many different brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, e.g., spellers, environmental controllers, web browsers, or for painting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent times, BCI systems are mature enough to leave the laboratories to be used by the end-users, namely severely disabled people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, new challenges arise and the systems should be implemented and evaluated according to user-centered design (USD) guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed and implemented a new system that utilizes the P300 pattern to compose music.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Brain Composing system consists of three parts: the EEG acquisition device, the P300-based BCI, and the music composing software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventeen musical participants and one professional composer performed a copy-spelling, a copy-composing, and a free-composing task with the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the USD guidelines, we investigated the efficiency, the effectiveness and subjective criteria in terms of satisfaction, enjoyment, frustration, and attractiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The musical participants group achieved high average accuracies: 88.24% (copy-spelling), 88.58% (copy-composing), and 76.51% (free-composing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The professional composer achieved also high accuracies: 100% (copy-spelling), 93.62% (copy-composing), and 98.20% (free-composing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  General results regarding the subjective criteria evaluation were that the participants enjoyed the usage of the Brain Composing system and were highly satisfied with the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Showing very positive results with healthy people in this study, this was the first step towards a music composing system for severely disabled people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are useful tools to provide communication without the need of any voluntary muscular control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A BCI can be an assistive device for people who are suffering from severe disabilities, i.e., who cannot communicate via the normally available channels due to motor degeneration or brain damage [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The so-called P300 event-related potential (ERP) is a prominent brain signal for BCI-control and is often assessed non-invasively by measuring the electroencephalogram (EEG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Farwell and Donchin [2] developed the first P300-based BCI application utilizing the so-called oddball paradigm where approx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  300ms after the presentation of a rare stimulus between frequently presented standard stimuli a positive deflection in the EEG occurs [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P300 was elicited by randomly flashing the rows and columns of a 6 × 6 matrix containing the letters of the alphabet and numbers between 09.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volunteers were asked to count the flashings of the symbol to be selected and to ignore the highlighting of the other characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Almost all existing BCIs attempting to evoke the P300 pattern visually are using this method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of BCI allows writing characters and letters or selecting commands on a computer screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the oddball principle, also auditory [4] and tactile [5] P300-based BCIs were developed and evaluated with healthy as well as severely disabled people, e.g., [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that with a P300 BCI it is possible to spell, browse the internet, control a smart home, and drive a wheelchair [1012].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also applications for entertainment have been developed [13, 14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One example for an application which allows the users to paint pictures and thereby express their creativity is the so-called Brain Painting application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This application was designed by the German artist Adi Hösele in cooperation with the Institute of Medical Psychology and Behavioural Neurobiology at the University of Tübingen [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A P300-based BCI is the basis of the Brain Painting system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a special P300 matrix, it is possible to select the color, grid size, object size, transparency, and other features which allow painting pictures on a virtual canvas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various studies have been conducted with the Brain Painting application demonstrating that it is possible for healthy people as well as for severely disabled people to paint pictures [1618].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the Brain Painting system was used by several severely disabled painters in their homes over a long time period and these painters had several exhibitions in different countries [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of the Brain Painting application was based on a user-centered design (USD) approach according to the ISO 9241210 norm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UCD is becoming more and more important in BCI research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many studies have already been published regarding this topic [1922].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Kübler et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [23] a BCI system for communication and control developed by UCD standards is evaluated and improved by three main factors, namely effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Besides painting pictures, another possibility for creative expression is to make music.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Utilizing the EEG to make music was first introduced by Adrian and Matthews in 1934 [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They implemented a sonification of the EEG signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first attempt to really compose a musical piece using EEG was performed by Lucier et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [25] in 1965.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other composers, like Rosenboom [26] and Teitelbaum [27], followed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these early so-called brain-to-music interfaces are based on sonification of the EEG signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first attempt to assess the performers attention with the EEG and make parameter-driven music by detecting selective attention was introduced by Rosenboom in 1990 [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifteen years later Miranda and Boskamp introduced the brain-controlled piano [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They gave generative rules to the most prominent frequency bands in the spectrum of the EEG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the system measured the complexity of the EEG signals to modulate the tempo and dynamics of the music.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  proposed a direct parameter mapping method to translate characters of the EEG into musical notes which is based on the power law of brain activities and music [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later this method was extended for deriving a quartet from multichannel EEG [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daly et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  developed and evaluated an affective brain-computer music interface for modulating the affective states of its users [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their system attempts to modulate the users current affective state by playing music which is generated by an algorithmic music composition system and a case-based reasoning system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An overview about brain-to-music interfaces is given in the book: Guide to Brain-Computer Music Interfacing [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Utilizing the P300 component of the EEG to compose music was introduced by Grierson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They arranged different tone pitches, between A1 and G5, on a P300 spelling matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a pilot study, five users were asked to select the C major notes, i.e., c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c. Four of the tested five subjects could finish the task with an accuracy rate of 75% or above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our Brain Composing system is based on the hypothesis that it is possible to effectively compose music via BCI without constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we combined two powerful systems, a P300-based BCI with a music composing software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BCI allows the user to control the composing software completely by concentrating on the elements of the P300 matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the suggested USD approach, in our opinion, a BCI system for disabled people has to be developed in two steps: first, the system has to be tested and evaluated with healthy subjects and improved according to the suggestions of that user group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a second step, the system has to be evaluated with the disabled users and adapted according to their feedback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This two-step method allows solving error and usability problems of the system before the intended end-users work with it for the first time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The objective of this strategy is to avoid that severely disabled people become demotivated by initial problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A pilot study, addressing the usability of the Brain Composing system, showed positive results [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five healthy participants took part in the pilot study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their task was to copy-compose a given melody with the Brain Composing system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A minimum of 42 selections were necessary to finish the task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three participants completed the task with accuracies between 77.8 and 95.7% and two participants were able to copy-compose more than half of the melody correctly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The aim of the current study is to test our hypothesis and therefore, to investigate accuracy and user-acceptance of the Brain Composing system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  User acceptance was determined with visual analogue scales, user experience questionnaires, and workload assessments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the Brain Composing system with 17 healthy volunteers with musical background and one professional composer with at least 40 years experience in composing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were asked to perform several tasks with the system and answer several questionnaires before and after the usage of the Brain Composing system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tasks were a copy-spelling task, two copy-composing tasks and a free-composing task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was the proof of concept before testing the system with disabled people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The designed Brain Composing system consists of three parts: the EEG acquisition system, the P300 control software, and the music composing software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For signal acquisition, we used a gel-less biosignal acquisition system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, a universal P300-based BCI control system [11] was connected to a powerful, open-source music composing software (MuseScore 1.3, https://musescore.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data_acquisition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EEG signals were recorded with the Mobita (Twente Medical Systems International B.V., Oldenzaal, the Netherlands) biosignal amplifier, which transmits signals with 24 bit resolution via Wi-Fi wireless technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrodes consist of small cotton pieces, connected to silver chloride pellets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cotton is soaked in tap water prior to the measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ground electrode is connected to a tap water soaked, conductive wrist band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplifier internally creates an average reference out of all used electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a real reference electrode is not required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This system ensures high usability [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EEG was recorded from six scalp electrodes (Fz, Cz, Pz, PO7, PO8, Oz) placed according to the extended international 1020 system, with a sampling rate of 250 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

P300-based_BCI_control_system  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The used P300-based BCI control system is a further development of a system which was introduced in [36] and has been used for various studies, e.g., [11, 35, 37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the main features is that it is a distributed system, i.e., a C-code written part is used for the stimulation, Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, USA) is responsible for the signal processing, and another C-coded program handles the signal acquisition [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the different parts are connected via a TCP network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The used data acquisition system delivers raw signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used a 4th order Butterworth band-pass filter with cut-off frequencies of 1 and 15 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in [11], different stimulation matrices are possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the described method in [11], new ways to change the content of the P300 matrix and to control an external application were implemented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The content of the P300 matrix is stored in a JSON (javascript object notation) file.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A JSON file can include the information for multiple matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition between different matrices is implemented by means of cross-links, i.e., every matrix has a unique name and can be called by an element of another matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, every JSON matrix item consists of four parts: a symbol that is shown in the matrix, a value that is sent to the external application by key-press simulations, a cross-link element that can contain the name of another matrix, and finally a selectable element that indicates whether the symbol should change the color when it was selected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implementation enables the user to control entire programs with the P300-based BCI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additionally, we implemented a dynamic stopping strategy that classifies the data after every flashing sequence, i.e., all rows and columns flashed once.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the classification result had been identical three times in a row, the corresponding element was marked yellow in the matrix, printed out in the bottom line, and sent to the controlled application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the minimal number of highlighting sequences was three, cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the defined maximum number of flashing sequences was reached without having a final result, the stimulation was reset and started again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Music_composing_software  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the Brain Composing system, we connected the P300-based BCI control system with the music composing software MuseScore (https://musescore.org) version 1.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This open-source music composing software provides an easily and commonly used environment to create high-quality western musical scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Music can be composed for many different instruments, e.g., string instruments, piano, or brass instruments, by combining note lengths and note pitches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional features like rests, slurs, accords, and many more are also available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sheets of music can be saved and exported in different media file formats, like MP3 or MIDI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the main reason why we decided to use this composing software is that an integrated shortcut manager allows creating shortcuts with different key combinations for nearly every possible command.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, all important control functions of the MuseScore software can be directly called via keyboard shortcuts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_composer_control_method  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By selecting the MuseScore item in the menu bar of the P300-based BCI control application, the MuseScore application is started.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the P300-based BCI control application displays the main Brain Composing matrix consisting of four cross-link elements: New, Open, Save, and Compose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By selecting one of these first three elements, the MuseScore program opens the new, open, or save dialog window and the matrix changes to a matrix filled with Latin letters and control elements to create, open, or save a sheet of music.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By selecting the Compose element, the user can directly start to compose music.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Composing elements are displayed in the matrix and the last used sheet of music is shown in the MuseScore window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To insert a note into a given sheet of music, first the note length has to be selected, see Fig 1 red arrow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The currently selected value is indicated by yellow color in the P300 matrix, see Fig 1(a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extra features for the note, like accidentals, dot, slur or chord, can be selected, see Fig 1 yellow arrow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accidentals and dots are just applied to the note pitch that is selected subsequently, whereas the slur and chord function remain activated, marked with yellow color until selected again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to add a note, a pitch has to be selected, see Fig 1 blue arrow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterwards, the selected note is played and the user sees the note on the sheet of music.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Errors can be corrected by deleting the note.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two elements (play all, play rest) are available to play the composed melody, see Fig 1 green arrow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various other elements are available, e.g., to navigate back and forth between notes or bars and to change the pitch in steps of one octave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_design_and_procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We evaluated the new Brain Composing system with eighteen participants in terms of efficiency, effeciveness and satisfaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the performed experiment, participants were seated in a comfortable chair approximately 70 cm away from two computer screens centered in front of them, see Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper screen displayed the P300 matrix used to control the music composing software, which was shown on the bottom screen when activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottom screen remained black during the calibration and copy-spelling tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Acquisition_of_behavioral_data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, participants had to fill out several questionnaires covering their motivation, mood, fatigue, workload and user experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following section, the used questionnaires are introduced in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

BCI_effectiveness_and_efficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A comparison of the different accuracies per participant and task is shown in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accuracy has to be higher than 70% to be sufficient, cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4750].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This threshold value is marked by a red dotted line in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-professional participants (N = 17) average copy-spelling accuracy was 88.2 (SD:16.3)% in a range between 60 and 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average time to spell one word (5 letters) was 77 (SD:6.8) seconds with a break of 6 seconds between the letters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For two participants, the task was unclear at the beginning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their accuracy increased from 20% for the first word to 100% for the second word.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculating the accuracy without these two participants (N = 15), the average accuracy would be 92.0 (SD:13.2)% instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The professional composer needed 73 seconds and 66 seconds to spell the two words with an accuracy of 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thirteen non-professional participants finished the copy-composing task with an average accuracy of 88.6 (SD:8.2)%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, they needed 54 (SD:9) selections to finish the task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a pause of 11.5 seconds between the selections, the average time was 21:23 (SD:3:38) minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four participants did not finish the task, because the task was aborted between 62 and 70 selections when the participants had no chance to finish it within 70 selections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at the end of the task only two participants were more than 10 steps away from finishing the composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One participant copy-composed the given melody without any error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six out of 17 participants composed the given melody with fewer than four errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The professional composer composed the given melody with an accuracy of 93.6% in 20 minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He needed 47 selections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thirteen non-professional participants used the full length of 30 minutes to compose their own melody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four participants who did not used the whole 30 minutes, stated that they composed what they wanted to achieve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the composed pieces of music are shown in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To hear the compositions please use S1 Music.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average classification accuracy of the non-professional participants was 76.5 (SD:17.2)%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the participants that could not finish the copy-composing task were excluded, the average accuracy would increase to 84.3 (SD:9.6)%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The non-professional participants composed, on average, 17.9 (SD:6.9, range: 631) notes during the free-composing run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, they needed, on average, 4.3 (SD:2.3, range 2.410.7) selections per note.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the participants made 2.4 selections per minute (SD:0.21) with an inter-selection pause of 11.5 seconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, they needed 1 hour and 32 minutes to fulfil all tasks plus the calibration with a standard deviation of 13 minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This period also includes pauses between the tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During that time the participants made, on average, 132 (SD:18) selections with the BCI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The professional composer composed only fourteen minutes freely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, he had an accuracy of 98.1%, composed 26 notes, needed 2.1 selections per note, and made 3.9 selections per minute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We presented the implementation and evaluation of the first BCI controlled music composing system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the results indicate that the system works efficiently and effectively and the users enjoyed using it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is still potential to improve the whole system according to the participants recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, a new version of the MuseScore software is available, which solves some arising problems and can be used without substantial changes in the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Composer_control_method  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The communication between the P300-based BCI system and the composing software works only in one direction: from the BCI to the composer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, if a command from the P300-based BCI does not reach the composing software, an asynchrony between the two systems can occure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if the selection of a different note length is lost between the speller and the composing software, a wrong note length will be displayed in the P300 matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This problem can only be solved by a two-way communication between the P300-based BCI and the music composing software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the composing software can acknowledge the received commands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implementation would require a network connection between the applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the open-source-feature of MuseScore, this implementation would be possible, but with much more implementation effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evaluation_of_the_BCI_efficiency_and_effectiveness  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The used tap water-based EEG amplifier system worked satisfactorily and had the advantage that hair wash was not necessary after the measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excluding the two participants who did not know how to spell at the beginning, the accuracy of the copy-spelling task was above 90%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high value could not be reached again at the copy-composing or the free-composing task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The copy-composing tasks were more complex and thus cognitively more demanding than the simple spelling tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As opposed to copy-spelling, during composing sometimes a combination of subsequent selections was necessary to insert a specific note, i.e., specifying according features such as accidentals or dots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in free-composing one needs to focus their attention on the to-be-selected element in the matrix while still creating a composition/melody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the non-professional participants, this is even more challenging and demanding than copy-composing a given melody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other side, it seems that this fact did not influence the performance of the professional composer: his accuracies were at all three P300-based BCI tasks above 93%, see Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, one can assume that he had the melody in his mind and just concentrated on the transposition of it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, he had lower accuracies when he had to copy-compose a melody than when he composed his own melody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pause between the blocks of P300 stimulation sequences was 10 seconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The professional composer and one non-professional participant told us that 10 seconds were too long.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to their recommendation, the breaks between the P300 stimulation periods could be adapted to the users to increase the efficiency of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another reason for decreasing accuracies might be the time the participants had to spell in a row.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the spelling task, the participants had a break after five selections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No regular breaks were planned during the composing tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight of the seventeen non-professional participants recommended that a pause element should be included into the P300 matrix to pause the system, cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This functionality should definitely be integrated in the next version of the Brain Composing system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A third reason for the lower composing accuracies could be that nine of the seventeen non-professional participants did not compose music at all and only six of the remaining participants reported to use composing software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out of this six only one participant solely uses composing software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the other non-professional participants stated that they first use their favorite instrument to compose and afterwards they transfer the composition to a computer using composing software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, they are not used to compose directly on the computer like the professional composer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The motivation of the users is a crucial factor for P300-based BCIs [51].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average result of the motivation VAS indicates that all participants were highly motivated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fact is reflected in the averaged high accuracies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these high accuracies, the participants felt to have good control over the system which, in turn, likely contributed to the high enjoyment and satisfaction they reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After approximately one hour and 31 minutes of using the system, the fatigue score had increased only slightly from 2.6 to 3.84.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that the duration of our measurement is not the upper limit of usage and can be extended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One important outlier of the satisfaction values was the score of the professional composer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The way he had to compose music with the Brain Composing system was very different to his normally used method, namely, a musical keyboard in combination with a music composing software (not MuseScore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combination allows him to give complex commands with low effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to the Brain Composing method, his method is of course faster and more efficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to the UEQ, the participants had a positive impression of all the asked items, except for efficiency, which was rated as neutral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not very surprising, because compared to the normally used healthy participants input modalities a BCI works much slower and therefore less efficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, one has to keep in mind that the introduced Brain Composing system is not designed for healthy people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is designed for disabled people, who are not able to use the normal computer input modalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design quality factor is very high, which means that the users had a very positive impression about the design of the Brain Composing system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use quality, which is calculated out of perspicuity, efficiency, and dependability, delivers also a mostly positive impression, albeit with a trend to be neutral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The professional composer rated the attractiveness and dependability significant lower than the other participants, but not negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reasons might be the same as for the already described VAS satisfaction item.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the given tasks were complex and cognitively demanding, the non-professional participants averaged NASA-TLX scores were moderate ranging from 25.33 to 83.33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mainly three factors contributed to the workload: mental demand, effort, and performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These three elements have also contributed most to the professional composers result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low values for frustration indicate that the partly low accuracies did not seriously frustrate the participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall rating of the professional composer was lower compared to the mean value of the others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, temporal demands did not contribute much to the total score, although eight of the seventeen non-professional participants asked for a pause button inside the matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Summarizing the answers from the UQ, many participants recognize that it is very important to avoid errors, because it costs a lot of effort to correct wrong selections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As already mentioned, many users suggest to implement a pause button to have flexible time between selections to think or make a break.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most important reported weakness, namely that it was sometimes unclear to the users where the selected note will be set, is already solved and/or integrated in the next version of the MuseScore software as first tests with the new version indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There the actual position in the sheet of music is better highlighted with a half transparent grey box instead of a line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, any uncertainty about the actual composing position should be a problem of the past.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from minor remarks, fifteen of the seventeen non-professional participants stated that they enjoyed using the Brain Composing system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We could show that it is possible to compose complex music pieces with the introduced Brain Composing system in a fast and comfortable way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average accuracies of the P300-based BCI tasks were very high even though the participants reported a moderate to high workload.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the participants reported that they enjoyed composing with the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This was the first step towards establishing a Brain Composing system as a tool for entertainment and, even more important, self-expression for severely disabled people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
