Spinal muscular atrophy within Amish and Mennonite populations: Ancestral haplotypes and natural history  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We correlate chromosome 5 haplotypes and SMN2 copy number with disease expression in 42 Mennonite and 14 Amish patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single haplotype (A1) with 1 copy of SMN2 segregated among all Amish patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMN1 deletions segregated on four different Mennonite haplotypes that carried 1 (M1a, M1b, M1c) or 2 (M2) copies of SMN2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA microsatellite and microarray data revealed structural similarities among A1, M1a, M1b, and M2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical data were parsed according to both SMN1 genotype and SMN2 copy number (2 copies, n = 44; 3 copies, n = 9; or 4 copies, n = 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No infant with 2 copies of SMN2 sat unassisted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, all 9 Mennonites with the M1a/M2 genotype (3 copies of SMN2) sat during infancy at a median age of 7 months, and 5 (56%) walked and dressed independently at median ages of 18 and 36 months, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All are alive at a median age of 11 (range 231) years without ventilatory support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among 13 Amish and 26 Mennonite patients with 2 copies of SMN2 who did not receive feeding or ventilatory support, A1/A1 as compared to M1a/M1a genotype was associated with earlier clinical onset (p = 0.0040) and shorter lifespan (median survival 3.9 versus 5.7 months, p = 0.0314).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These phenotypic differences were not explained by variation in SMN1 deletion size or SMN2 coding sequence, which were conserved across haplotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinctive features of SMA within Plain communities provide a population-specific framework to study variations of disease expression and the impact of disease-modifying therapies administered early in life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biallelic deletions of SMN1 cause spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; MIM# 253300), a common monogenic cause of infant mortality characterized by progressive degeneration of lower motor neurons [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMN1 encodes survival motor neuron protein (SMN), which is 294 amino acids in length (32 kDa) and interacts with other proteins to influence ribonucleoprotein assembly, ubiquitin homeostasis, cytoskeletal dynamics, endocytosis, and neuromuscular junction stability [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMN is expressed in tissues throughout the body but lower motor neurons are particularly vulnerable to its absence [4, 6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SMA locus on human chromosome 5q13 contains telomeric SMN1 and centromeric SMN2, both of which produce SMN protein, and 8 other genes aligned within a 2 Mb vicinity (OCLN, GTF2HCDC, SERF1B, SERF1A, NAIP, GTF2H2, LOC647859, and LINC02197).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region is subject to deletions, duplications, and rearrangements that damage SMN1 and its neighboring genes and also give rise to a variable number of SMN2 copies [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to SMN1, SMN2 contains a base difference (c.850CT) that excludes exon 7 from approximately 90% of mRNA transcripts to produce a truncated protein (SMN7; 282 amino acids, 30.5 kDa) that is non-functional and rapidly degraded [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residual intact SMN translated from each SMN2 copy partially compensates for SMN1 deficiency such that genomic SMN2 copy number correlates inversely with disease severity [911]: two SMN2 copies commonly segregate with a severe (type 1) SMA phenotype whereas three or more copies correlate with later disease onset and slower progression [12, 13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within ethnically mixed (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  outbred) populations, carrier frequencies for pathogenic SMN1 deletions are between 1.4% (African American) and 2.1% (Caucasian)[14, 15], but range from 3 to 13% in certain endogamous populations of Israel [16, 17], Hungary [18], Spain [19], France [20], and the United States [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the individuals who comprise a multiethnic cohort, patients from a common founder lineage are typically homozygous for the same SMN1 mutation, share a large proportion of background genetic material, experience similar dietary and environmental exposures, live in comparable socioeconomic conditions, and adhere to similar patterns of medical resource utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, founder groups naturally control for many genetic and environmental variables that complicate natural history studies in outbred cohorts [22, 23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spinal muscular atrophy is relatively common among Old Order Amish and Mennonite (Plain) populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contemporary Plain people descended from a small group of Swiss Anabaptist founders who migrated to the New World during the early 18th century and have remained isolated in small demes across North and South America [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we investigate ancestral chromosome 5 haplotypes in relation to SMA phenotype among 42 Mennonite and 14 Amish individuals harboring 2 (n = 44), 3 (n = 9), or 4 (n = 3) copies of SMN2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the first comprehensive clinical description of SMA within Plain communities and provides a unique lens through which to view the natural history of disease undistorted by technological interventions, genetic variability, and heterogenous approaches to care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

SMA_in_founder_populations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Contemporary Plain people descended from just a few hundred Swiss-German Anabaptists and now comprise more than 800,000 individuals living in isolated demes throughout North and South America [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transatlantic migrations during the 18th century reduced genetic diversity within founding settlements and set the stage for genetic drift; over successive generations, some rare alleles became common while others became extinct [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Driven by these mechanisms, the Mennonite SMA carrier frequency equilibrated at its present value of 3.7%, which extrapolates to a disease incidence of 1 per 2,800 newborns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Population control data are insufficient to measure carrier frequency among the Amish, but diagnostic rates in our laboratory over the last decade suggest it approximates 3% (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A high incidence of SMA is not unique to Plain populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1977, Fried and Mundel estimated an SMA carrier frequency of 10% among Egyptian Karaites, a group socially and reproductively isolated for more than 10 centuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, carrier frequencies between 3 and 13% were identified within founder populations worldwide [1621].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these are the Hutterite people, an Anabaptist group descended from 16th century South German founders who migrated east from Austria-Tyrol to settle in Canada, Montana, and the Dakotas [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their unique ancestral roots are reflected in a single extant SMA haplotype that contains 2 copies of SMN2 and segregates with a carrier frequency of 12.5% in colonies of South Dakota [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genotype-phenotype_correlations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Jordanova and colleagues first explored the relationship between ancestral haplotypes and SMA phenotype among 32 Romani families living throughout Hungary and Bulgaria [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using 5 microsatellite markers, they delineated three dominant haplotypes (A, B, and C) which segregated in four combinations (A/A, A/B, A/C, and C/C) to cause profoundly different disease patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They postulated that rearrangements on a single ancestral chromosome produced haplotypes A, B, and C, and attributed clinical differences to resulting variations of SMN2 copy number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied the same principle, with greater resolution, to the study of SMA within Amish and Mennonite populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As expected, genotypes with 2 copies of SMN2 (A1/A1, M1a/M1a, M1a/M1b, and M1a/M1c) were associated with earlier disease onset, more restricted motor development, and shorter survival than genotypes with 3 (M1a/M2) or 4 (M2/M2) SMN2 copies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a broader developmental spectrum for these latter groups (Table 1) and among 9 patients with 3 SMN2 copies, one even climbed stairs by 14 months of age (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other members of the M1a/M2 cohort, including her 3 siblings, walked between 17 and 42 months of age and never ascended stairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our clinical population, such variation is not explained by differences in SMN1 deletion structure [18] or SMN2 mRNA processing [32, 33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, disease expression in this particular child might have been attenuated by a rare allele outside the 5q13 SMA locus, as has been observed for the PLS3 and NCALD genes [3437].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is not uncommon to observe phenotype variability among SMA patients with 3 or 4 copies of SMN2 [12, 21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More surprising, however, was the variable clinical course of A1/A1 versus M1/M1 homozygotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A1/A1 genotype segregated with particularly severe SMA, characterized by prenatal/perinatal onset (Table 1) and median survival of only 3.9 (as compared to 5.7) months (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microsatellite and SNP analyses of the SMA locus yielded no explanation for this; A1 and M1a were similar with respect to SMN1 deletion size and SMN2 sequence (Fig 3)[31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One could speculate that Amish and Mennonite families adhere to different norms of medical resource utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this would not explain the high prevalence of pre- and perinatal signs among A1/A1 (71%) as compared to M1/M1 (20%) infants and the striking uniformity of the A1/A1 phenotype, which seem to indicate a fundamental difference in disease biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An allele outside the 5q13 SMA locus might account for such a difference but would need to be relatively fixed within either Amish (deleterious) or Mennonite (protective) populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More likely, there are structural differences between A1 and M1a that are in linkage disequilibrium with the SMN1 deletion, have a functionally relevant impact on disease expression, and were undetected by our analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA marker data (Fig 3 and S2 Table) show these haplotypes to be similar but not identical, and we thus plan to use WES data to compare A1 and M1a at higher resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Natural_history_and_implications_for_clinical_trials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conservative Anabaptists share core beliefs that influence their decisions about end-of-life care, particularly the application of invasive, costly, or heroic measures for children who are otherwise helpless [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For infants with type 1 SMA, many Old Order Amish and Mennonite parents reject inpatient hospitalization and life-sustaining measures, which they tend to view as compounding their childs suffering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we managed most type 1 SMA patients with a minimally invasive strategy in the home setting, and thus Fig 7A represents haplotype-specific survival in the absence of supportive technologies or inpatient care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This is clearly depicted in Fig 6B, which shows a profound survival benefit for the minority of children (11%) who were fed by gastrostomy and used BiPAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6D illustrates this principle in a different but striking way: Mennonite patients born more recently were likely to die younger [29], perhaps because the youngest generation of parents, fully informed with a molecular diagnosis and having witnessed the toll of SMA on other community members, were least likely to pursue life-sustaining treatment [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here it is important to emphasize that Plain communities do not eschew modern medical technologies in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, they tend to view them pragmatically, with a sharp focus upon the potential of any intervention to actually reduce versus prolong suffering, and at what cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The advent of safe and effective antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) and adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based gene replacement therapies has shifted this calculus [4042].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knowledge of population genetics allows us to conduct targeted SMA carrier testing, identify couples at risk, and collect cord blood from their offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can then use rapid, low-cost methods (Fig 3B) to determine SMN1 mutation status and SMN2 copy number of high-risk newborns within a few hours of life (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides a critical therapeutic advantage; data from ASO and AAV-based gene therapy trials consistently show better outcomes with earlier treatment [4, 40, 42, 43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The opportunity to administer preventative therapies within a few days of life creates a pressing need to use appropriate historical control data to gauge their efficacy [4, 6, 40, 42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few prospective studies, carefully conducted in the modern era, have partially filled this gap [10, 30, 44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SMA patients with 2 copies of SMN2, data from the PNCR Network (n = 23) and NeuroNEXT (n = 20) projects align closely on the endpoint of median death or permanent ventilation between 8 and 10 months of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that type 1 SMA follows a distinctly different trajectory within and between Anabaptist founder cohorts (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation might extend to members of other founder lineages, who share relatively uniform genetic background and tend to experience common environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural conditions that shape disease expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These facts give critical context to clinical trial data [2224, 38, 45] and provide the appropriate framework for evaluating SMA rescue therapies administered to Amish and Mennonite babies within the first weeks of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Patients_and_clinical_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We studied 56 SMA patients born between 1965 and 2017 (175 aggregate patient-years) who lived in Canada, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Missouri, Colorado, and New York (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty-two (75%) derived from Old Order Mennonite communities of the Northeastern United States, had homozygous deletions of SMN1, and traced to a common ancestor across 11 generations (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourteen Old Order Amish patients shared SMN1 deletions that traced back several generations (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used available medical records and structured interviews to collect retrospective information about birth weight, growth, clinical signs, motor development, morbidity, and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interviews were conducted systematically by two investigators and, in most cases, vetted using medical charts and household records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
