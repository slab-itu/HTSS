An Unusual New Theropod with a Didactyl Manus from the Upper Cretaceous of Patagonia, Argentina  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Background  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Late Cretaceous terrestrial strata of the Neuquén Basin, northern Patagonia, Argentina have yielded a rich fauna of dinosaurs and other vertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diversity of saurischian dinosaurs is particularly high, especially in the late Cenomanian-early Turonian Huincul Formation, which has yielded specimens of rebacchisaurid and titanosaurian sauropods, and abelisaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continued sampling is adding to the known vertebrate diversity of this unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methodology__Principal_Findings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A new, partially articulated mid-sized theropod was found in rocks from the Huincul Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It exhibits a unique combination of traits that distinguish it from other known theropods justifying erection of a new taxon, Gualicho shinyae gen. et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. Gualicho possesses a didactyl manus with the third digit reduced to a metacarpal splint reminiscent of tyrannosaurids, but both phylogenetic and multivariate analyses indicate that didactyly is convergent in these groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Derived characters of the scapula, femur, and fibula supports the new theropod as the sister taxon of the nearly coeval African theropod Deltadromeus and as a neovenatorid carcharodontosaurian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of these features are independently present in ceratosaurs, and Gualicho exhibits an unusual mosaic of ceratosaurian and tetanuran synapomorphies distributed throughout the skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions__Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gualicho shinyae gen. et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. increases the known theropod diversity of the Huincul Formation and also represents the first likely neovenatorid from this unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is the most basal tetatanuran to exhibit common patterns of digit III reduction that evolved independently in a number of other tetanuran lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A close relationship with Deltadromaeus from the Kem Kem beds of Niger adds to the already considerable biogeographic similarity between the Huincul Formation and coeval rock units in North Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fossiliferous Huincul Formation (Late Cenomanian-Early Turonian) is widely exposed in Neuquén and Río Negro provinces of northern Patagonia, Argentina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has yielded a diverse dinosaur fauna, including the remains of some of the largest dinosaurs known such as the titanosaurian sauropod Argentinosaurus [1], and the giant carcharodontosaurid theropod Mapusaurus [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other notable dinosaur finds from this unit are the rebbachisaurid sauropod Cathartesaura [3], and the mid-sized abelisauroids Ilokelesia [4] and Skorpiovenator [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The senior author (S.A.) discovered a fossiliferous stretch of continuous Huincul Formation outcrops on the Río Negro shore of the Ezequiel Ramos Mexía Reservoir, in 1999.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A joint expedition in 2007 that included three of the authors explored this set of exposures informally dubbed "Violante's field," and made several discoveries, including parts of a sauropod skeleton, a maxilla and several vertebrae of an abelisaurid theropod, and numerous dinosaur coprolites [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most significant find, however, was an articulated partial skeleton of an unusual, mid-sized theropod dinosaur comprising a short section of the dorsal vertebral column, a distal section of the tail, the left scapulocoracoid and forelimb, and parts of both hind limbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This specimen was subsequently excavated and prepared by staff of the Museo Patagónico de Ciencias Naturales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The new specimen exhibits a new and unusual combination of derived characters that warrant recognition of a new taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chief among these is a didactyl manus reminiscent of Late Cretaceous Laurasian tyrannosaurids, but the new specimen also exhibits derived traits otherwise only found in ceratosaurian theropods, as well as basal tetanurans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the new theropod taxon and discuss its affinities and biogeographic implications, as well as examining forelimb reduction among theropods in light of this new discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Material  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The specimen described here was discovered on a paleontological expedition led by the senior author with the participation of NDS and PJM (see S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A letter granting permission to prospect and collect fossils was issued to the senior author by Marcelo Solorza, who was Director of the Agencia Cultura de la Provincia de Río Negro at the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As per agreement in this letter, all materials collected during the expedition were deposited in the Museo Patagónico de Ciencias Naturales, a provincially supported public repository in General Roca, Provincia de Río Negro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new theropod specimen is housed and cataloged at that institution as MPCN PV 0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Phylogenetic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The skeleton of Gualicho exhibits an unusual combination of character states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some, such as the didactyl manus with a semilunate distal carpal are indicative of derived tetanuran affinities [7], whereas others, such as the expanded posterior margin of the metatarsal III proximal articulation, are shared with ceratosaurs [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to infer the relationships of this unusual species, we added it to a recently published, broadly sampled analysis of basal tetanuran phylogeny that also includes a number of ceratosaurian taxa [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We made edits in character coding (see S1 Text), which did not alter the strict consensus tree topology presented by [7], and also added nine new characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modified matrix is available as S1 File.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taxon sampling was increased by including not only Gualicho, but also the roughly coeval Deltadromeus [9], as the two taxa share some unique anatomical traits in the pectoral girdle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both taxa are quite fragmentary, and the proportion of missing data in Gualicho (76.3%) and Deltadromeus (78.8%) exceed the median value (63.8%) for the entire data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The matrix was analyzed with Maximum Parsimony in the freeware TNT [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One thousand random addition replicates were subjected to the Tree Bisection and Rearrangement (TBR) algorithm, with 10 trees retained for each replicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stored shortest trees recovered were then subjected to an additional round of TBR branch swapping to obtain all shortest trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were also analyzed using the "new technologies" option, to ensure that the shortest trees had been obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shortest trees obtained were subjected to strict consensus and reduced consensus techniques to summarize common branching patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the results of the first analysis, which recovered Gualicho as sister to neovenatorid allosauroids including megaraptorans, we also added Gualicho as a terminal taxon to a recently published dataset [11], which is slightly modified from a previous study [12], and which posits tyrannosauroids as closely related to megaraptorans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aim of this was to test the possibility whether the didactyl manus of Gualicho could be a synapomoprhy shared with Tyrannosauridae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the Carrano et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7] matrix, we edited scorings and added characters (See S1 Text), but in this case editing led to different most-parsimonious topologies from those originally published by the authors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modified matrix is available as S2 File.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of Gualicho did not alter the branching pattern between taxa in the new topologies, when subjected to parsimony analysis using the same protocol as outlined above, suggesting that character re-scoring and unordering of characters rather than taxon addition led to the observed topological changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original authors ordered many multistate characters (~10% of all characters were ordered), but we reran the modified dataset with all characters unordered in keeping with the modified Carrano et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7] dataset and to determine what effect this parameter had on results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multivariate_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unusual forelimb of Gualicho invites comparisons to other clades with reduced forelimbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond examining the topologies and character state optimizations resulting from the cladistic analysis, we addressed the question of whether Gualicho shares aspects of forelimb reduction with other clades, or whether these evolved in parallel, through multivariate analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined forelimb disparity in theropods in two complementary ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firstly, we followed an approach originally advocated by Foote [13] and employed recently in vertebrate paleobiology by several authors [1416] by conducting a Principal Coordinates (PCO) analysis on the forelimb character data from the main phylogenetic dataset [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used all 33 characters related to the humerus, forearm, carpus, and manus, (S2 Text) employing the Gower metric to derive a morphospace so as to downweight the influence of multistate characters over binary ones, and also because this metric accommodates missing data [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Missing data forced us to reduce the dataset to 34 of the original taxa from the phylogenetic dataset that permit scoring of more than 46% of the traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also added six taxa (Eoabelisaurus, Guanlong, Albertosaurus, Harpymimus, Ornithomimus, Tanycolagreus) which exhibit some degree of forelimb reduction in a broad sense (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  reduction in muscle attachments or articulations as well as elemental shortening), but which were not part of the Carrano et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7] matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCO matrix is available as S1 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our second approach was to conduct a morphometric analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We added length measurements of the humerus, ulna, metacarpal I, and femur of MPCN PV 0001 to a published dataset of theropod limb measurements [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data set was sorted, so that only taxa with complete forelimb (humeral, radial and MC I lengths) and femoral measurements were included and logarithmically transformed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Avian taxa including scansoriopterygids were also excluded to amplify differences between non-avian theropod taxa, and because they are phylogenetically remote from Gualicho.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final data set included 61 taxa (S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were subjected to phylogenetic Principal Components Analysis (pPCA) [18] in the R software environment [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A phylogenetic tree for the 61 taxa was constructed to reflect the results of the first phylogenetic analysis above based on the Carrano et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7] data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous taxa in the pPCA analysis were not included in our phylogenetic analysis, so their relationships were resolved to follow recent analyses that infer relationships within those clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relationships within Ceratosauria follow [20], and relationships among Coelurosauria are taken from [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Branch lengths were calibrated stratigraphically and zero-branch lengths were corrected using the EQUAL method using the STRAP package [22] in R [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Nexus-formatted file with the tree is available as S3 File, a text file with taxon ages for calibrating the tree is available as S4 File, a data file of log-transformed measurements formatted for R analysis is provided in S3 Table and a text file with the R script to execute the pPCA is available in S5 File.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following analysis of the data, we exported pPCA scores from R to PAST [23] for graphical manipulation, and convex hulls were plotted for individual clades to facilitate comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted by Benson and Choiniere [17], the first phylogenetic Principal Component (PC) axis is largely driven by size, as revealed by the strong (close to -1) and similar loadings on all four parameters, so comparisons focused on phylogenetic Principal Components 2 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forelimb data were analyzed with femoral length included as a proxy for body size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ran separate analyses implementing either a Brownian Motion model or a Lambda model for the pPCA analysis and used the covariance method to calculate Principal Component scores, loadings and other variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have noted that model choice can bias pPCA results [24], but suitable methods to address this concern are still under development, hence our choice to implement both available models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed a traditional Principal Components Analysis in PAST [23] to contrast with the pPCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Phylogenetic_results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Addition of Gualicho and Deltadromeus to the Carrano et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7] character-taxon matrix resolves them as basal carcharodontosaurians and sister to the neovenatorid radiation (Fig 14A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is recovered whether the nine new characters are included or not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the phylogenetic position of these two fragmentary specimens appears well resolved, support is relatively low, with Bremer support [65] values of 1 for most nodes along the spine of the tetanuran radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the sister-taxon relationship between Gualicho and Deltadromeus is relatively robust (branch support = 3), despite the fact that both specimens are incomplete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of Gualicho introduces some character conflict, with tree length increasing from 1044 to 1063 steps, and addition of both Deltadromeus and Gualicho increases tree length to 1075 steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison to the tree length increases associated with inclusion of other taxa as calculated with a modified version (see S6 File) of the Term_lengths script (http://phylo.wdfiles.com/localfiles/tntwiki/Term_lengths.run) suggests that the tree length increments associated with Gualicho (9 steps) and Deltadromeus (10 steps) are well below increments associated with other taxa such as Dilophosaurus (29 steps), Ceratosaurus (19 steps), and Majungasaurus (25 steps).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conflict is borne in characters for which Gualicho, and more specifically, Deltadromeus, exhibit character states that are either plesiomorphic for tetanurans or shared with Ceratosauria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, if Gualicho is excluded from the analysis, Deltadromeus groups with ceratosaurs, mirroring previously published results [8, 30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constraining these two taxa to both be ceratosaurs results in an increase in tree length to 1079 steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the analysis of the modified Porfiri et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [11] dataset, Gualicho was recovered near the base of Coelurosauria (Fig 14B), well removed from either didactyl tyrannosaurids, or the megaraptoran clade it was close to in the Carrano et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7] dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, however, our reanalysis following changes to the matrix found Neovenator as sister taxon to a clade of coelurosaurs plus Gualicho and megaraptorans rather than as a member of Allosauroidea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not find support for megaraptorans as members of Tyrannosauroidea as previously reported [11, 12] after rescoring a number of characters in those analyses (see S1 Text) and running all traits as unordered, although megaraptorans were found to be closer to tyrannosauroids than to the included carcharodontosaurids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The very different results of these two analyses are predicated on significant differences in both taxon- and character sampling, and only a more comprehensive analysis beyond the scope of this description can resolve the disagreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gualicho shinyae represents a new tetanuran theropod taxon from the Huincul Formation, which is distinct from other coeval and sympatric theropods lineages such as Carcharodontosauridae represented by Mapusaurus [2], and Abelisauridae represented by Ilokolesia [4] and Skorpiovenator [5], thus adding to the known taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of Neuquén Group dinosaurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It exhibits a peculiar diagnostic character combination including traits that converge on derived character states observed in various remotely related clades including ceratosaurs (metatarsal III proximal dimensions [8]), tyrannosaurids (reduced forelimb with didactyl manus [67]), and megaraptorans (elongate dorsal centra, hooked process on lateral tibial condyle [38]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mosaic of synapomorphies from multiple, distantly related groups renders our understanding of the affinities of Gualicho highly uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated by the two phylogenetic analyses conducted here on datasets that overlap insufficiently in character, and especially, taxon sampling, Gualicho occupies different derived positions within Tetanurae, depending on which matrix is used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more robust evaluation of its affinities requires a more comprehensive review of theropod relationships that samples widely among ceratosaurians, allosauroids, and basal coelurosaurs, but which is beyond the scope of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At lower taxonomic levels, Gualicho shares several derived characters with the African theropod Deltadromeus from the nearly coeval Kem Kem beds of Niger, including a scapula with a sinuous border on the transition from the acromion process to the blade, reduced distal humeral articulations, and an expanded lobe bearing a medial trough on the proximocaudal aspect of the fibula.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both taxa also share a proximocaudally expanded articulation on Metatarsal III, a trait also seen in ceratosaurs (antarctometatarsal condition of Carrano and Sampson [8]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sister taxon relationship between Deltadromeus and Gualicho is supported in our analysis of tetanuran relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, with a Bremer Support value of 3, this clade is among the most well supported relationships in the tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, notable differences exist between the two taxa, such as in the anatomy of the humerus, which is longer than the scapula in Deltadromeus (unlike the original reconstruction [9]), but much shorter in Gualicho.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Gualicho exhibits a mediolaterally expanded humeral head and moderately well-developed muscle attachment including a lobate deltopectoral crest set at a right angle to the expanded and pointed internal tuberosity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the humeral head is hemispherical in Deltadromeus, and the internal tuberosity and deltopectoral crest are reduced, traits otherwise observed and considered to be synapomophies of ceratosaurian theropods [8, 26], or independently acquired within subclades thereof such as Abelisauridae and Noasauridae [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike ceratosaurs, however, Deltadromeus does exhibit a lobate, albeit very small, deltopectoral crest as in Gualicho and most allosauroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The affinities of Deltadromeus have long been uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was originally described as a basal coelurosaur [9], but was subsequently interpreted as a basal ceratosaurian [8, 30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, it is interesting to note that Gualicho does exhibit some apparent ceratosaurian synapomorphies, most notably a robust MT III with posteriorly expanded proximal articulation [8, 26] and a flange-like m. iliofibularis tubercle [26], but has a distinctly tetanuran manus morphology [7], and carcharodontosaurian traits such as mid-dorsal centra with slit-like pneumatic foramina [7, 38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our analysis, the unconstricted metatarsal condition and fibular flange morphology are interpreted as a synapomorphy of Gualicho and Deltadromeus, acquired convergently with ceratosaurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of this apparent mosaic of ceratosaurian and tetanuran synapomorphies in these two atypical Gondwanan taxa, it is interesting to note their inclusion does not add significantly to tree length when compared to other species included in the phylogenetic analysis when accounting for completeness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A number of characters shared by Gualicho and Deltadromeus relate to forelimb reduction in the broad sense (i.e., reduction in either length or robustness, or both), and are convergently present in other theropod clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, ornithomimids (e.g., Ornithomimus RTMP 95.110.1) exhibit a slender, straight humerus with a sub-spherical head [26], a reduced deltopectoral crest [26, 64], and an unexpanded distal end with a shallow flexor fossa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these traits are observed in Deltadromeus, and the straight shaft and poorly developed distal articulation are also present in Gualicho, and some combination of these states are also observed in many flightless birds, for example Dromaius [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this set of traits commonly seen in reduced and vestigial forelimbs of theropods raises the possibility that potential synapomorphies in the distal humerus uniting Gualicho and Deltadromeus could be homoplastic, other synapomorphies are distributed throughout the pectoral girdle and hindlimb, arguing against this grouping being the result of a single anatomical region undergoing parallel reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another trait related to forelimb reduction is the apparent didactyly of the manus of Gualicho, which resembles those of tyrannosaurids in having the third digit reduced to a metacarpal splint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Closer scrutiny, however, reveals a number of detailed differences in manual anatomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In tyrannosaurids, the carpal elements are reduced and proximodistally flattened [67], whereas in Gualicho the semilunate and scapholunare carpals retain a more complex shape typical of the carpal elements of most non-coelurosaurian tetanurans [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the manus of Gualicho differs from tyrannosaurids [67] in having a proportionately more robust metacarpal I with a rectangular, rather than triangular, proximal articulation in end view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PCO analysis is consistent with the interpretation of our phylogenetic result implying that forelimb reduction in Gualicho likely occurred independent of other lineages with reduced forelimbs such as abelisauroids, alvarezsaurids, ornithomimosaurs, and especially didactyl tyrannosaurids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Gualicho falls close to the abelisauroid morphospace in the pPCA analysis and within the convex hull for abelisauroids in PCA morphospace, despite the fact that the manus of Gualicho differs substantially in anatomy from that of abelisauroids and that this result is inconsistent with our phylogenetic results, even though Gualicho (and Deltadromeus) share some derived hindlimb traits with ceratosaurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differing results of the PCO and pPCA /PCA analyses suggest that while forelimb reduction in Gualicho was not accompanied by the same suite of discrete or qualitative traits observed in ceratosaurs, reduction in scaling of elements may have followed similar patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both multivariate analyses suggest parallel evolutionary trends in taxa with abbreviated forelimbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the PCO plot clades such as tyrannosaurids and abelisaurids with shortened forelimbs occur far to the left along PCO1 and even within these clades, more derived members occur to the left of more basal relatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some noteworthy differences also emerge from comparisons of these results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the PCO plot ornithomimosaurs exhibit a trend parallel to that of tyrannosaurids whereas in the pPCA plot they exhibit nearly orthogonal trajectories indicating that patterns of trait change and changes in forelimb proportions are not always correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, Gualicho, which exhibits forelimb proportions similar to those of ceratosaurs, is more similar to most tetanurans, and basal coleurosaurs in particular in terms of the forelimb trait scorings sampled in the PCO analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results support classical "many-to-one" mapping models of convergence [70] in that there are many different ways to evolve a shortened or reduced forelimb across theropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important distinction, however, is that function likely differed across all these taxa with reduced forelimbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, reduction of the forelimb in Gualicho exhibits some general commonalities with other tetanurans such as loss of digit III phalanges and reduction of its metacarpal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though most similar to the tyrannosaurid condition, progressive reduction of digit III is seen in other tetanurans including Megaraptor (Digit III very slender), derived alvarezsaurids (loss of all Digit III elements and Digit II phalanges in Linhenykus [71]), Caudipteryx (loss of terminal phalanges of Digit III), and Ornithuromorpha (loss of all Digit III phalanges).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gualicho appears to be the phylogenetically basalmost, though not the temporally oldest, taxon to exhibit this developmental reduction pattern that is common among tetanurans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A sister taxon relationship between Gualicho and Deltadromeus is consistent with other known global-scale faunal distributions, as many of the dinosaurs found in the Huincul Formation are closely related to species found in mid-Cretaceous strata across North Africa including the Kem Kem Compound Assemblage (KKCA) of Morocco [72], the equivalent Bahariya Formation of Egypt, and Echkar and Elhraz Formations of Niger [73].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While faunal differences exist between these poorly age-constrained units in North Africa, those may be related to poor sampling [73], so we will consider these assemblages as roughly equivalent for the purposes of this broad scale discussion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Huincul Formation and KKCA represent among the latest occurrences of rebbachisaurid sauropods in the global record [25, 74] and the Huincul, Bahariya, and Echkar Formations yield latest definitive Gondwanan skeletal occurrences of carcharodontosaurids [7,75].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bahariya and Huincul Formations also share the earliest appearance of gigantic (25 m) titanosaurian sauropods [1,76], which are also known from the roughly coeval Bayo Overo Member of the Cerro Barcino Formation, central Patagonia, and from the Bajo Barreal Formation of southern Patagonia [77].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first appearance of abelisaurids with rugose facial ornamentation in South America is in the Candeleros [78] and overlying Huincul Formation [4,5], as well as in the Bajo Barreal Formation [79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is temporally equivalent to the first appearance of this clade in Africa, represented by the Cenomanian taxon Rugops from the Echkar Formation of Niger [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These strong faunal resemblances between strata in the Neuquén and San Jorge Basins of Patagonia and North African Cenomanian beds are intriguing, but difficult to interpret due to a lack of well sampled, age equivalent strata elsewhere [80].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these distributions provided evidence of Gondwanan-Laurasian vicariance during the Aptian to Santonian in a recent global analysis of Mesozoic biogeography [81], that analysis excluded all Gondwanan landmasses except for South America and Africa for mid-Cretaceous time slices, and is therefore not informative with respect to biogeographic patterns across Gondwanan continents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While data from Crocodyliformes suggests closer potential affinities between South America and Indo-Madgascar [82] than with Africa during the mid-Cretaceous, it is critical to bear in mind that sampling can have significant impact on any recovered biogeographic signal [83], and authors have noted that sampling is likely insufficient to adequately test biogeographic hypotheses for either dinosaurs [8] or crocodyliformes [84] in Gondwana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, patterns of local extirpation and a poor global mid-Cretaceous record have been invoked as critical factors in generating observed distribution patterns among theropods [7, 8], dinosaurs [85] and tetrapods in general [80], and better sampling is required before a robust explanation can be proffered for the similarities we note between the Huincul Formation and approximately age-equivalent strata in Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Important differences between the coeval Huincul Formation (Neuquén Basin) and Bahariya Formation (Bahariya Oasis) faunas can be related to environmental differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KKCA and Bahariya Formation represent nearshore, mesic units [72, 76, 86, 87] characterized by a rich aquatic fauna (e.g., elasmobranchs, osteichthyes [88], crabs [89], semi-aquatic theropods like Spinosaurus [86]), whereas the Huincul Formation was deposited in a foreland basin far from the coast, as demonstrated by the absence of a rich aquatic fauna, and no evidence of northern Gondwanan spinosaurids in its otherwise rich dinosaur fauna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this paleoenvironment-based interpretation may be tempered by the presence of the Central Gondwanan Desert, which has been interpreted as a barrier for both spinosaurid dinosaurs and podocnemidoid turtles [75].  #@NEW_LINE#@#
