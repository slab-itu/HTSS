malERA: An updated research agenda for malaria elimination and eradication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Achieving a malaria-free world presents exciting scientific challenges as well as overwhelming health, equity, and economic benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WHO and countries are setting ambitious goals for reducing the burden and eliminating malaria through the Global Technical Strategy and 21 countries are aiming to eliminate malaria by 2020.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The commitment to achieve these targets should be celebrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the need for innovation to achieve these goals, sustain elimination, and free the world of malaria is greater than ever.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over 180 experts across multiple disciplines are engaged in the Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) Refresh process to address problems that need to be solved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result is a research and development agenda to accelerate malaria elimination and, in the longer term, transform the malaria communitys ability to eradicate it globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 2011 malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) was the first comprehensive analysis of the science needed to support national elimination of malaria and the long-term goal of its global eradication [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2011 malERA consultative process engaged a multidisciplinary group, involving members of the infectious disease and malaria research and implementation communities, and identified both emerging challenges and approaches to solving them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five years later, the review of progress and emerging challenges, as well as a more nuanced understanding of the implementation problems that need to be solved, drove the 2016 malERA Refresh, with the intent to assess progress and the emergence of new challenges, examine current hypotheses, and point to the key research and development areas that can advance the feasibility of malaria elimination in the most challenging areas of the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Global goals for a reduction in malaria burden and elimination were published in 2 complementary documents in 2015: the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 20162030 (GTS) and Action and Investment to defeat Malaria 20162030 (AIM), a global investment case for financing and coordinating these efforts [2,3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other groups have expressed a vision of global malaria eradication and underscored the need for R&D investments and country financing [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Building on the goals expressed in the GTS and AIM, the World Health Organization (WHO) has established a Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) to analyse future scenarios for malaria, including eradication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WHO SAG has affirmed WHOs long-standing commitment to the goal of eradication, although it does not specify an end date for that goal [5,6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is not an assumption that 1 single silver bullet will solve all of the challenges, butas was stated by Tachi Yamada in 2007imperfect tools applied imperfectly can still achieve remarkable impact, and a toolbox of solutions is needed that countries can draw upon and adapt to their health and social systems context [7,8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A strong research base is a keystone for long-term progress in achieving the goals of the GTS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is in this context that the malERA Refresh Panels propose a multidisciplinary research agenda for researchers, programme implementers, and research funders to accelerate problem solving and impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Accelerating_to_elimination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Elimination of malaria means the interruption of local transmission (reduction to zero incidence of indigenous cases) of a specified malaria parasite in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required (see Glossary, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of countries have been able or are on their way to eliminating malaria by applying a combination of vector control, efficient case management, and active surveillance strategies, all with existing tools for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 2000 and 2015, 17 countries eliminated malaria [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further 21 countries have been identified as having the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020, comprising the E-2020 (Fig 1) [10,11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are key elements to the elimination strategy, reflected in high uptake of core interventions by programmes and communities: a robust surveillance, reporting, and response system; prevention with a variety of ways to deliver insecticides and barrier methods to stop infectious bites; and diagnosis and treatment with effective combination medications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, WHO now frames national elimination as a continuum rather than the achievement of milestones for specific phases [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heterogeneous nature of malaria across geographies means that a single approach will not work in all settings with the same efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the Acceleration Hypothesis, countries with high vectorial capacity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, may require measures to rapidly deplete the parasite population [6,12], after which, locally tailored vector control, case management, and surveillance strategies with active methods to investigate and clear infections can then more effectively reduce transmission [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst currently being considered and tested, strategies to accelerate elimination (such as mass drug administration [MDA] with antimalarials, low dose primaquine, complementary tools to address residual transmission, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  have not yet, and may not be, proven to be widely effective in moving settings with high residual transmission towards sustainable elimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ongoing research testing these tools and strategies is curated in the open MESA Track database [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across the malaria endemic world, there exist challenges, and it is here that innovation is required to achieve elimination and quicken its course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those challenges include areas of high receptivity (where the ecosystems are favourable for malaria transmission), highly competent vectors, residual transmission, resistance to drugs and/or insecticides, and areas where there are human populations that are not adequately served by the health system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some key points emerge from experiences in elimination countries and are worth clarifying, because they frame the context for evaluation of new tools to accelerate progress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, elimination has been progressing using current tools and strategies; second, transmission intensity varies widely between and within countries with different mosquitoes and parasite species as well as different health systems and a myriad of varying challenges to the scale-up of interventions; in addition, programmatic goals evolve as transmission changes (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction of transmission may progress in a highly variable fashion, affected by ecologic (e.g., climate and outbreaks), biologic (e.g., vector or parasite resistance), and operational (e.g., health delivery system, sociopolitical and -economic status) challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, while some countries have shown durable elimination [23], other countries have come close to but not achieved elimination and then experienced resurgences [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New approaches are needed to address vulnerability and receptivity so that elimination can be achieved and sustained in spite of predictable risk of importations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

malERA_Refresh_process  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The malERA Refresh was undertaken against the background of WHO GTS that was unanimously adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2015 as well as the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) AIM framework [2,3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although focussed on malaria, the malERA process itself can be a useful model for defining the research needs, strategies, and portfolios to eliminate and eradicate neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The malERA Refresh process was overseen by a leadership group composed of Regina Rabinovich (chair, ISGlobal Barcelona Institute for Global Health and Harvard T.H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chan School of Public Health), Pedro Alonso (WHO Global Malaria Programme), Marcel Tanner (Swiss TPH), and Dyann Wirth (Harvard T.H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chan School of Public Health), and each consultative panel was led by a chair and 1 or 2 cochairs [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process was managed by the MESA Secretariat (ISGlobal Barcelona Institute for Global Health).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diverse expert panels of scientists, programme managers, and decision makers were convened for 6 thematic areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The themes of the panels were adapted from the original malERA, reflecting the evolution of the knowledge base even since the first malERA process in 2011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One panel examined tools for elimination (vector control, vaccines, diagnostics, and drugs), one panel tackled the application of mathematical modelling to the challenges of combining interventions, and the health systems panel also addressed policy research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New panels were created, one to look at the infectious reservoir and one focussed on resistance to antimalarial drugs and insecticides (for the full list of panels, see Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A systematic literature search was performed for each theme to identify papers published between 2010 and 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These papers were supplemented with suggestions from panelists and projects in the MESA Track database of active projects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each panel had 1 in-person meeting to assess the progress since malERA 2011 and discussed whether there had been adequate efforts to address each area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into consideration the major advances that have taken place since the first malERA consultations, the panels highlighted specific challenges and indicated key opportunities to generate knowledge, tools, and strategies for malaria elimination (Box 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross-links between the panels were ensured by cross-panel participation and an online consultation of main findings (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A final meeting of all panel leaders reviewed results of this process and identified cross-cutting themes that arose across several panels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are described further in this paper: surveillance, implementation science, and transmission and persistence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, 2 areasentomology and P. vivax malariawere recognised as research areas that were consistently failing to garner adequate resources and thus scientific engagement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than define specific areas for prioritisation, this research agenda lays out the rationale, context, and relevance for a range of interlinked areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Looking_forward  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Innovation and problem solving tailored to the local setting are critical to the long-term success of the global malaria programme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three types of innovation need to be pursued: iterative, breakthrough, and integrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  malERA Refresh is replete with examples: drugs to overcome resistance, gene drive as a transformative technology, and the acceleration hypothesis as a testable approach to elimination and its interaction with the health system in highly endemic countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To pursue the opportunities proposed here for accelerating elimination, a diverse landscape of funders is needed to prioritise research objectives according to their strategic plans and stakeholders needs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A diligent monitoring of the uptake of the research questions in this agenda and the impact of the evolving evidence base will be essential to keep the malaria community on course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
