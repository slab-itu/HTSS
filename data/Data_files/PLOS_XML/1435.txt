Breakdown of local information processing may underlie isoflurane anesthesia effects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The disruption of coupling between brain areas has been suggested as the mechanism underlying loss of consciousness in anesthesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis has been tested previously by measuring the information transfer between brain areas, and by taking reduced information transfer as a proxy for decoupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, information transfer is a function of the amount of information available in the information sourcesuch that transfer decreases even for unchanged coupling when less source information is available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we reconsidered past interpretations of reduced information transfer as a sign of decoupling, and asked whether impaired local information processing leads to a loss of information transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important prediction of this alternative hypothesis is that changes in locally available information (signal entropy) should be at least as pronounced as changes in information transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this prediction by recording local field potentials in two ferrets after administration of isoflurane in concentrations of 0.0%, 0.5%, and 1.0%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found strong decreases in the source entropy under isoflurane in area V1 and the prefrontal cortex (PFC)as predicted by our alternative hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in source entropy was stronger in PFC compared to V1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information transfer between V1 and PFC was reduced bidirectionally, but with a stronger decrease from PFC to V1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This links the stronger decrease in information transfer to the stronger decrease in source entropysuggesting reduced source entropy reduces information transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion fits the observation that the synaptic targets of isoflurane are located in local cortical circuits rather than on the synapses formed by interareal axonal projections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, changes in information transfer under isoflurane seem to be a consequence of changes in local processing more than of decoupling between brain areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that source entropy changes must be considered whenever interpreting changes in information transfer as decoupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Currently we do not understand how anesthesia leads to loss of consciousness (LOC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One popular idea is that we loose consciousness when brain areas lose their ability to communicate with each otheras anesthetics might interrupt transmission on nerve fibers coupling them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This idea has been tested by measuring the amount of information transferred between brain areas, and taking this transfer to reflect the coupling itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, information that isnt available in the source area cant be transferred to a target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the decreases in information transfer could be related to less information being available in the source, rather than to a decoupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this possibility measuring the information available in source brain areas and found that it decreased under isoflurane anesthesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a stronger decrease in source information lead to a stronger decrease of the information transfered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the input to the connection between brain areas determined the communicated information, not the strength of the coupling (which would result in a stronger decrease in the target).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that interrupted information processing within brain areas has an important contribution to LOC, and should be focused on more in attempts to understand loss of consciousness under anesthesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To this day it is an open question in anesthesia research how general anesthesia leads to loss of consciousness (LOC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several recent theories agree in proposing that anesthesia-induced LOC may be caused by the disruption of long range inter-areal information transfer in cortex [15]a hypothesis supported by a series of recent studies [3, 69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all of these studies, information transfer is quantified using transfer entropy [10], an information theoretic measure, which has become a quasi-standard for the estimation of information transfer in anesthesia research, or by transfer entropys linear implementation as a Granger causality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many of these studies reduced information transfer has been interpreted as a sign of inter-areal long range connectivity being disrupted by anesthesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yet, information transfer between a source of information and a target depends on information (entropy) being available at the source in the first place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering constraints of this kind we can easily conceive of cases where a decrease in information transfer under anesthesia is observed despite unchanged long range coupling, e.g., when the available information at the source decreases due to an anesthesia-related change in local information processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, this dissociation between information transfer and causal coupling just reflects that information transfer is one possible consequence of physical coupling, but not identical to it [1113].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Therefore, we consider it necessary to evaluate the hypothesis that the reduced inter-areal information transfer observed under anesthesia possibly originates from disrupted information processing in local circuits rather than from disrupted long range connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This alternative hypothesis receives additional support for the case of isoflurane, which potentiates agonist actions at GABAA-receptors and inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR) receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, evidence on direct inhibitory effects of isoflurane on AMPA and NMDA synapses, which are the dominant mediators of long-range cortico-cortical interactions, is sparse at best (see table 2 in [14]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the alternative hypothesis of changed local information processing, a decrease in transfer entropy under anesthesia must be accompanied by:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we perform tests of these predictions by estimating local information processing in and information transfer between local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously recorded from primary visual cortex (V1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of two ferrets under different levels of isoflurane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantify local information processing by estimating the signal entropy (measuring available information) and quantified information transfer between recording sites by estimating transfer entropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, to demonstrate the effect of reduced source entropy on transfer entropy, we estimated transfer entropy on simulated data with a constant coupling between processes, but a varying source entropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better understand potential changes in local information processing we also quantified the active information storage, a measure of the information available at a recording site that can be predicted from past signals at that site, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the information stored from past to present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the estimation of such information theoretic quantities from finite data is difficult in general, we employ two complementary strategies: (i) probability density estimation based on nearest-neighbor searches in continuous data, and (ii) Bayesian estimation based on discretized data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also test whether the previously reported decrease of transfer entropy under anesthesia can indeed be replicated when avoiding some recently identified pitfalls in estimation of information transfer related to the use of symbolic time series, suboptimal embedding of the time series, and the use of net transfer entropy without identification of the individual information transfer delays (for problems related to these approaches see [15]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results provide first evidence for the alternative hypothesis of altered local information processing causing reduced information transfer, as the above predictions were indeed met.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest to consider the alternative hypothesis as a serious candidate mechanism for LOC, and to use causal interventions to gather further experimental evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preliminary results for this study were published in abstract form in [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Existence_of_information_transfer_between_recording_sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before analyzing differences in information transfer induced by isoflurane, we tested for the existence of significant information transfer between the recording sites (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both animals, TESPO was significant in the top-down direction, while the bottom-up direction was significant for animal 1 only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A non-significant information transfer in bottom-up direction for animal 2 may be explained by the dark experimental environment, i.e., the lack of visual input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Changes_in_information_theoretic_measures_under_anesthesia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, for higher isoflurane levels both locally available information and information transfer were decreased, while information storage in local activity increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the estimation of information theoretic measures from finite length neural recordings poses a considerable challenge we present detailed, converging results from two complementary strategies to deal with this challengenearest-neighbor based estimators, and a Bayesian approach to entropy estimation suggested by Nemenman, Shafe, and Bialek (NSB-estimator) [17, 18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter approach required a discretization of the continuous-valued LFP data, but yields principled control of bias, while the first approach allows the estimation of information-theoretic measures directly from continuous data, and thus conserves the information originally present in those data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical testing was performed using a nonparametric permutation ANOVA (pANOVA), and a linear mixed model (LMM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LMM approach was used in addition to the main pANOVA for the purpose of comparison to older studies using parametric statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Optimized_embedding_parameters_for_TESPO_and_AIS_estimation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As noted in the introduction, the estimation of information theoretic measures from finite data is challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the measures that describe distributed computation in complex systems, such as transfer entropy, estimation is further complicated because the available data are typically only scalar observations of a process with multidimensional dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This necessitates the approximate reconstructions of the process states via a form of embedding [21], where a certain number of past values of the scalar observations spaced by an embedding delay are taken into account (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for a pendulum swinging through its zero position one additional past position values will clarify whether its going left or right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important part of proper transfer entropy estimation is thus optimization of this number of past values (embedding dimension), and of the embedding delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two embedding parameters then approximately define past states, whose correct identification is crucial for the estimation of transfer entropy [22], but also for the estimation of active information storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without it information storage may be underestimated and, erroneous values of the information transfer will be obtained; even a detection of information transfer in the wrong direction is likely (see [15, 22, 23] and Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing studies using transfer entropy often omitted the optimization of embedding parameters, and instead used ad-hoc choices, which may have had a detrimental effect on the estimation of transfer entropyhence the need for a confirmation of previous results in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we therefore used a formal criterion proposed by Ragwitz [21], to find an optimal embedding defined by the embedding dimension d (the number of values collected) and delay  (the temporal spacing between them), to find embeddings for the TESPO and AIS past states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the implementation of this criterion provided by the TRENTOOL toolbox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the bias of the estimators used depends on d, we used the maximum d over all conditions and directions of interaction as the common embedding dimension for estimation from each epoch to make the estimated values statistically comparable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting dimension used was 15 samples, which is considerably higher than the value commonly used in the literature [6, 7], when choosing the embedding dimension ad-hoc or using other criteria as for example the sample size [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The embedding delay  was optimized individually for single epochs in each condition and animal as it has no influence on the estimator bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relevance_of_individual_information_transfer_delay_estimation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several previous studies on information transfer under anesthesia reported the sign of the so called net transfer entropy (TEnet) as a measure of the predominant direction of information transfer between two sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEnet is essentially just the normalized difference between the transfer entropies measured in the two direction connecting a pair of recording sites (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When calculating TEnet, it is particularly important to individually account for physical delays  in the two potential directions of information transfer, because otherwise the sign of TEnet may become meaningless (see examples in [15]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As this delay is unknown a priori it has to be found prior to the actual estimation of information transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have recently shown that this can be done by using a variable delay parameter u in a delay sensitive transfer entropy estimator TESPO (see Methods); here, the u that maximizes the transfer entropy over a range of assumed values for u reflects the physical delay [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The necessity to individually optimize u for each interaction is not a mere theoretical concern but was clearly visible in the present study: Fig 5C shows representative results from ferret 1 under 0.0% isoflurane, where apparent TESPO values strongly varied as a function of the delay u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, TEnet values also varied if a common delay u was chosen for both directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the sign of the TEnet varied as a function of individual choices for uPFC  V1 and uV1  PFC for each direction of information transfer and hence became uninterpretable (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a consequence of the above, we here individually optimized u for each direction of information transfer in each condition and animal to estimate the true delay of information transfer following the mathematical proof in [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We individually optimized u to obtain estimates of transfer entropy that were not biased by a non-optimal choice for u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the implementation in TRENTOOL [23] and scanned values for u ranging from 0 to 20 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Averages for optimized delays ranged from 47 ms across animals and isoflurane levels (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that in Fig 5C, TESPO as a function of u shows multiple peaks, especially for the direction V1  PFC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these peaks resembled an oscillatory pattern close to the low-pass filter frequency used for preprocessing the data, we investigated the influence of filtering on delay reconstruction by simulating two coupled time series for which we reconstructed the delay with and without prior band-pass filtering (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For filtered, simulated data TESPO as a function of u indeed showed an oscillatory pattern for certain filter settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, broadband filteringas used here for the original datadid not lead to the reconstruction of an incorrect value for the delay  (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, when filtering using narrower bandwidths, the reconstruction of the correct information transfer delay failed (Fig 7D7F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding supports the general notion that filtering, especially narrow-band filtering, may only be applied with caution before estimating connectivity measures [24, 25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yet, since broad-band filtering did not lead to the observed oscillatory patterns in the simulated data, alternative explanations for multiple peaks in TESPO are more likely: one alternative cause of multiple peaks in the TESPO are multiple information transfer channels with various delays between source and target (see [15], especially Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each information transfer channel with its individual delay will be detected when estimating TESPO as a function of u (see simulations in [15]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further possible cause for multiple peaks in the TESPO is the existence of a feedback loop between the source of TESPO and a third source of neural activity [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such a feedback loop, information in the source is fed back to the source such that it occurs again at a later point in time, leading to the repeated transfer of identical bits of information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both causes are potential explanations for the occurrence of multiple peaks in the TESPO in the present studyyet, deciding between these potential causes requires additional research, specifically interventional approaches to the causal structure underlying the observed information transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In sum, our results clearly indicate the necessity to individually optimize information transfer delays and that often employed ad-hoc choices for u may result in spurious results in information transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional simulations of filtering effects showed that narrow-band filtering may have detrimental effects on this optimization procedure and should thus be avoided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relation_of_information-theoretic_measures_with_other_time-series_properties  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The information-theoretic measures used in this study are relatively novel and have been applied in neuroscience research rarely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is conceivable that these measures quantify signal properties that are more easily captured by traditional time-series measures, namely, the autocorrelation decay time (ACT), the signal variance, and the power in individual frequency bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the overlap between information-theoretic and traditional measures, we calculated correlations between AIS and ACT, between H and signal variance, between TESPO and ACT, between TESPO and signal variance, and between AIS, H, and TESPO and the power in various frequency bands, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 8 shows average ACT, signal variance, and power over recordings, for individual isoflurane levels and recording sites, and for both animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detailed tables showing correlation coefficients and explained variances are provided as supporting information S1 to S6 Tables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, for AIS and ACT we found significant correlations in both animals, however the median of the variance explained, , over individual recordings was below 0.1 for each significant correlation in an animal, recording site and isoflurane level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, even though there was some shared variance between ACT and AIS, there remained a substantial amount of unexplained variance in AIS, indicating that AIS quantified properties other than the signals ACTin line with results from our earlier studies [27, 28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is expected because the autocorrelation (decay) time ACT measures how long information persists in a time series in a linear encoding, while AIS, in contrast, measures how much information is stored (at any moment), and also reflects nonlinear transformations of this information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that there is still some shared variance between the two measures here may be explained by the construction of the AISs past state embedding, where the time steps between the samples in the embedding vector are defined as a fractions of the ACT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Between H and signal variance, we found no significant correlation; moreover, correlations for individual recordings were predominantly negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The TESPO was significantly correlated with source ACT for an isoflurane level of 1.0%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also for the correlation of TESPO and the sources variance, we found significant correlations for the bottom-up direction under 0.5% and 1.0% isoflurane in animal 1, and for both directions under 1.0% isoflurane in animal 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all significant correlations we found , again indicating a substantial amount of variance in TESPO that was not explained by ACT or signal variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When correlating band power with information-theoretic measures, we found significant correlations between AIS and all bands in both animals animals (see supporting information S4 Table, ); for H and band power, we found correlations predominantly in higher frequency bands (beta and gamma, see supporting information S5 Table, ); for TESPO and band power, we found significant correlations predominantly in the gamma band and one significant correlation in the delta band for animal 2 and in the beta band for animal 1, respectively (see supporting information S6 Table, ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, we found relationships between the power in individual frequency bands and all three information-theoretic measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all measures, the variance explained was below 0.2, indicating again that band power did not fully capture the properties measured by TESPO, AIS, and H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed long-range information transfer between areas V1 and PFC in two ferrets under different levels of isoflurane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that transfer entropy was indeed reduced under isoflurane and that this reduction was more pronounced in top-down directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results validate earlier findings made using different estimation procedures [3, 69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As far as information transfer alone was concerned our results are compatible with an interpretation of reduced long-range information transfer due to reduced inter-areal coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, this interpretation provides no direct explanation for the findings of reduced locally available information as explained below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the alternative hypothesis that the reduced long range information transfer is a secondary effect of changes in local information processing provides a concise explanation for our findings both with respect to locally available information, and information transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reduction_in_transfer_entropy_may_be_caused_by_changes_in_local_information_processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test our alternative hypothesis we evaluated two of its predictions about changes in locally available information, as measured by signal entropy, under administration of different isoflurane concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, entropy should be reduced; second, the strongest decrease in information transfer should originate from the source node with the strongest decrease in entropy, rather than end in this node.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that signal entropy decreased; the most pronounced decrease in signal entropy was found in PFC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with our prediction, we found that PFCthe node with the larger decrease in entropywas also at the source, not the target, of the most pronounced decrease in transfer entropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is strong evidence against the theoretical possibility that in a recording site, entropy decreased due to a reduced influx of informationbecause in this latter scenario the strongest reduction in entropy should have been found at the target (end point) of the most pronounced decrease in information transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, our hypothesis that long-range cortico-cortical information transfer is reduced because of changes in local processing must be taken as a serious alternative to the currently prevailing theories of anesthetic action based on disruptions of long range interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that a renewed focus on local information processing in anesthesia research will be pivotal to advance our understanding of how consciousness is lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our predictions that reductions in entropy should potentially be reflected in reduced information transfer derives from the simple principle that information that is not available at the source cannot be transferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We may thus in principle reduce TESPO to arbitrarily low values by reducing the entropy of one of the involved processes, without changing the physical coupling between the two systems, just by changing their internal information processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trivial but important fact has been neglected in previous studies when interpreting changes in information transfer as changes in coupling strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when this bound is not attained, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  because only a certain fraction of the local information is transferred even under 0.0% isoflurane, it seems highly plausible that reductions in the locally available information affect the amount of information transfered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This line of reasoning generalizes to applications beyond anesthesia research, i.e., every application that observes changes in information transfer between two or more experimental conditions should consider changes in local information processing as a potential alternative cause.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A possible indication of how exactly local information processing is changed is given by the observation of increased active information storage in PFC and V1 (also see the next paragraph).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that more old information is kept stored in a sources activity under anesthesia, rather than being dynamically generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such stored source information will not contribute to a measurable transfer entropy under most circumstances because it is already known at the target (see [29], section 5.2.3, for an illustrative example).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relation_between_changed_locally_available_information_and_information_storage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In general, AIS increases if a signal becomes more predictable when knowing its past, but is unpredictable otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also means that the absolute AIS is upper-bounded by the systems entropy H (see Methods, Eq 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a decrease in H can in principle lead to a decrease in AIS, i.e., fewer possible system states may lead to a decrease in absolute AIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the present study, we observed an increase in AIS while H decreasedthis indicates an increase in predictability that more than compensates for the decrease in locally available information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the system visited fewer states in total but the next state visited became more predictable from the systems past.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a reduction in entropy and increase in predictability points at highly regular neural activity for higher isoflurane concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a behavior in activity is in line with existing electrophysiological findings: under anesthesia signals have been reported to become more uniform, exhibiting repetitive patterns, interrupted by bursting activity (see [5] for a review).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Purdon and colleagues observed a reduction of the median frequency and an overall shift towards high-power, low-frequency activity during LOC [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, slow-wave oscillatory power was more pronounced during anesthesia-induced LOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LOC was also accompanied by a significant increase in power and a narrowing of oscillatory bands in the alpha frequency range in their study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Limitations_of_the_applied_estimators_and_measures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unfortunately a quantitative comparison between different information theoretic estimates that would directly relate H, AIS and TESPO is not possible using the continuous estimators applied in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their estimates are not comparable because the bias properties of each estimator differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each estimator, the bias depends on the number of points used for estimation as well as on the dimensionality of involved variableshowever, the exact functional relationship between these two quantities and the bias is unknown and may differ between estimators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (In our application, the dimensionality is determined mainly by the dimension of the past state vectors, and by how many different state variables enter the computation of a measure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This lack of comparability makes it impossible to normalize estimates; for example, transfer entropy is often normalized by the conditional entropy of the present target state to compare the fraction of transferred information to the fraction of stored information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We forgo this possibility of comparison for a greater sensitivity and specificity in the detection of changes in the individual information theoretic measures here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New estimators, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bayesian estimators like the ones tested here, promise more comparable estimates by tightly controlling the biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, these estimators were not as reliable as expected in our study, displaying a relatively high variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A further important point to consider when estimating transfer entropy between recordings from neural sites, is the possibility of third unobserved sources influencing the information transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, third sources (e.g., in the thalamus) may influence the information transfer between PFC and V1for example, if a third source drove the dynamics in both areas, the areas would become correlated, leading to non-zero estimates of TESPO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This TESPO is then attributable to the correlation between source and target, but does not measure an actual information transfer between sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, information transfer estimated by transfer entropy should in general not be directly equated with a causal connection or causal mechanism existing between the source and target process (see also [12] for a detailed discussion of the difference between transfer entropy and measures of causal interactions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Potential_physiological_causes_for_altered_information_transfer_under_anesthesia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We here tested the possibility that changes in local information processing lead to the frequently observed reduction in information transfer between cortical areas under isoflurane administration, instead of altered long-range coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results on entropies and active information storage suggest that this is a definite possibility from a mathematical point of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This is supported by the neurophysiology related to the mode of action of isoflurane, because a dominant influence of altered long-range coupling on TESPO would mandate that synaptic terminals of the axons mediating long range connectivity should be targets of isoflurane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such long range connectivity is thought to be dominated by glutamatergic AMPA receptors for inter-areal bottom-up connections, and glutamatergic NMDA receptors for inter-areal top-down connections, building upon findings in [31] and [32] (but see [33] for some evidence of GABAergic long range connectivity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, evidence for isoflurane effects on AMPA and NMDA receptors is sparse to date (table 2 in [14]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the receptors most strongly influenced by isoflurane seem to be GABAA and nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR) receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, isoflurane potentiates agonist interactions at the former, while inhibiting the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, if one adopts the current state of knowledge on the synapses involved in long-range inter-areal connectivity, evidence speaks against a dominant effect of modulation of effective long-range connections by isoflurane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, in turn, points at local information processing as a more likely reason for changed transfer entropy under isoflurane anesthesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation is perfectly in line with our finding that decreases in source entropy seem to determine the transfer entropy decreases, instead of decreases in transfer entropy determining the target entropies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nevertheless, targeted local interventions by electrical or optogenetic activation of projection neurons, combined with the set of information theoretic analyses used here, will most likely be necessary to reach final conclusions on the causal role of local entropy changes in reductions of transfered information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Investigating long-range information transfer under anesthesia is motivated by the question how changed information transfer may cause LOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To that effect, our findingsa dominant decrease in top-down information transfer under anesthesia, and a decrease in locally available information possibly driving itmay be interpreted in the framework of predictive coding theory [3436].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predictive coding proposes that the brain learns about the world by constructing and maintaining an internal model of the world, such that it is able to predict future sensory input at lower levels of the cortical hierarchy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether predictions match actual future input is then used to further refine the internal model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thus assumed that top-down information transfer serves the propagation of predictions [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theories of conscious perception within this predictive coding framework propose that conscious perception is determined by the internal prediction (or hypothesis) that matches the actual input best [35, p. 201].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be conversely assumed that the absence of predictions leads to an absence of conscious perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the framework of predictive coding theory two possible mechanisms for LOC can be inferred from our data: (1) the disruption of information transfer, predominantly in top-down direction, may indicate a failure to propagate predictions to hierarchically lower areas; (2) the decrease in locally available information and in entropy rates in PFC may indicate a failure to integrate information in an area central to the generation of a coherent model of the world and the generation of the corresponding predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These hypotheses are in line with findings reviewed in [4] and [38], which discuss activity in frontal areas and top-down modulatory activity as important to conscious perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Future research should investigate top-down information transfer more closely; for example, recent work suggests that neural activity in separate frequency bands may be responsible for the propagation of predictions and prediction errors respectively [37, 39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future experiments may target information transfer within a specific band to test if the disruption of top-down information transfer happens in the frequency band responsible for the propagation of predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Last, it should be kept in mind that different anesthetics may lead to loss of consciousness by vastly different mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ketamine, for example, seems to increase, rather than decrease, overall information transferat least in sub-anesthetic doses [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_the_alternative_approaches_to_the_estimation_of_information_theoretic_measures_and_to_statistical_testing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main analysis of this study was based on information theoretic estimators relying on distances between neighboring data points and on a permutation ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As each of these has its weaknesses we used additional alternative approaches, first, a Bayesian estimator for information theoretic measures, and second, statistical testing of non-aggregated data using LMMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both approaches returned results qualitatively very similar to those of the main analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, replacing neighbor-distance based estimators with Bayesian variants, we replicated the main finding of our studya reduction in information transfer and locally available information, and an increase in information storage under anesthesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, using the Bayesian estimators we did not find a predominant reduction of top-down compared to bottom up information transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, using LMMs for statistical testing instead of a pANOVA additionally revealed a more pronounced reduction in top-down information transfer also in ferret 2 (in this animal, this effect was not significant when performing permutation tests based on the aggregated data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Bayesian estimators performed slightly worse than the next neighbor-based estimators in terms of their higher variance in estimates across recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, even though Bayesian estimators are currently the best available estimators for discrete data, they may be a non-optimal choice for continuous data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A potential reason for this is the destruction of information on neighborhood relationships through data binning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is, however, necessary to make the current Bayesian estimators applicable to continuous data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In sum, we obtained similar results through three different approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes us confident that locally available information and information transfer indeed decrease under anesthesia, while the amount of predictable information increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

On_information_theoretic_measures_obtained_from_from_continuous_time_processes_via_time-discrete_sampling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When interpreting the information theoretic measures presented in this work, it must be kept in mind that they were obtained via time-discrete sampling of processes that unfold in continuous time (such as the LFP, or spike trains).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This time-discrete sampling was taken into account in recent work by Spinney and colleagues [41], who could show that the classic transfer entropy as defined by Schreiber is indeed ambiguous when applied to sampled data from time-continuous processesit can either be seen as the integral of a transfer entropy rate in continuous time over one sampling interval, and is then given in bits, or it can be seen as an approximation to the continuous time transfer entropy rate itself, and be given in bits/sec.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study we stick with the first notion of transfer entropy, and note that our results will numerically change when using different sampling intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the case of transfer entropy covered in [41], corresponding analytical results for AIS are not known at present, as this is still a field of active research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To nevertheless elucidate the practical dependency of AIS on the sampling rate, when using our estimators, we have taken the original data and have up- and down-sampled them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed the empirical AIS depended on the sampling rate (supporting information S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, all relations of AIS values between different isoflurane concentrations, i.e., the qualitative results, are independent of sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, sampling effects do not affect the conclusions of the current study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_cautionary_note_on_the_interpretation_of_information_theoretic_measures_evaluated_on_local_field_potential_data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When interpreting the results obtained in this study it should be kept in mind that LFP signals are not in themselves the immediate carriers of information relevant to individual neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because from a neurons perspective information arrives predominantly in the form postsynaptic potentials generated by incoming spikes and chemical transmission in the synaptic cleft (but see [42] for a potential influence of LFPs on neural dynamics and computation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, LFP signals merely reflect a coarse grained view of the underlying neural information processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, our results only hold in as far as at least some relevant information about the underlying information processing survives this coarse graining in the recording process, and little formal mathematical work has been carried out to estimate bounds on the amount of information available after coarse graining (but see [43]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yet, the enormous success that brain reading approaches had when based on local field potentials or on even more coarse grained magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [44]) indicates that relevant information on neural information processing is indeed available at the level of these signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, successful attempts at decoding neural representations of stimuli or other features of the experimental setting should not lead us to misinterpret the information captured by information theoretic measures of neural processing as necessarily being about something we can understand and link to the outside world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quite to the contrary, the larger part of information captured by these measures may be related to intrinsic properties of the unfolding neural computation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using two different methods for transfer entropy estimation, and two different statistical approaches, we found that locally available information and information transfer are reduced under isoflurane administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger decrease in the locally available information was found at the source of the larger decrease of information transfer, not at its end point, or target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, previously reported reductions in information transfer under anesthesia may be caused by changes in local information processing rather than a disruption of long range connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest to put this hypothesis more into the focus of future research effort to understand the loss of consciousness under anesthesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggestion receives further support from the fact that the synaptic targets of the anesthetic isoflurane, as used in this study, are most likely located in local circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electrophysiological_recordings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted simultaneous electrophysiological recordings of the local field potential (LFP) in primary visual cortex (V1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of two female ferrets (17 to 20 weeks of age at study onset) under different levels of isoflurane (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw data are available from [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choice of the animal model is discussed further in [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were made in a dark environment during multiple, individual sessions of max.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 h length, during which the animals heads were fixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For recordings, we used single metal electrodes acutely inserted in putative layer IV, measured 0.30.6 mm from the surface of cortex (tungsten micro-electrode, 250-m shank diameter, 500-k impedance, FHC, Bowdoin, ME).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hardware high pass filter was 0.1 Hz and the low pass filter was 5,000 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A silver chloride wire placed between the skull and soft tissue was used as the reference electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reference electrode was located approximately equidistant between the recording electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This location was selected in order to have little shared activity with either recording electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same reference was used for both recording locations; also the same electrode position was used for both animals and all isoflurane concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that electrode placement was indeed in V1, we mapped receptive fields by eliciting visually evoked potentials in a separate series of experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed electrode placement in PFC by lesioning through the recording electrode after completion of data collection and post-mortem histology (as described in [46]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on surgical procedures can be found in [47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfiltered signals were amplified with gain 1,000 (model 1800, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA), digitized at 20 kHz (Power 1401, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK), and digitally stored using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis, data were low pass filtered (300 Hz cutoff) and down-sampled to 1000 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All procedures were approved by the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (UNC-CH IACUC) and exceed guidelines set forth by the National Institutes of Health and U.S. Department of Agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LFPs were recorded during wakefulness (condition iso 0.0%, number of recording sessions: 8 and 5 for ferret 1 and 2, respectively) and with different concentrations of anesthetic: 0.5% isoflurane with xylazine (condition iso 0.5%, number of sessions: 5 and 6), as well as 1.0% isoflurane with xylazine (condition iso 1.0%, number of sessions: 10 and 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the course of pilot experiments, both concentrations iso 0.5% and iso 1.0% lead to a loss of the righting reflex; however, a systematic assessment of this metric during recordings was technically not feasible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, animals were administered 4.25 ml/h 5% dextrose lactated Ringer and 0.015 ml/h xylazine via IV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LFP recordings from each session were cut into epochs of 4.81 s length to be able to remove segments of data if they were contaminated by artifacts (e.g., due to movement).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose a relatively short epoch length to avoid removing large chunks of data when there was only a short transient artifact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in 196 to 513 epochs per recording (mean: 428.6) for ferret 1, and 211 to 526 epochs (mean: 472.8) for ferret 2. epochs with movement artifacts were manually rejected (determined by extreme values in the LFP raw traces).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the iso 0.0% condition, infrared videography was used to verify that animals were awake during the whole recording; additionally, iso 0.0% epochs with a relative delta power (0.5 to 4.0 Hz) of more than 30% of the total power from 0.5 to 50 Hz were rejected to ensure that only epochs during which the animal was truly awake entered further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Information_theoretic_measures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure information transfer between recording sites V1 and PFC, we estimated the transfer entropy [10] in both directions of possible interactions, PFC  V1 and V1  PFC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate local information processing within each recording site, we estimated active information storage (AIS) [19] as a measure of predictable information, and we estimated differential entropy (H) [48] as a measure of information available locally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will now explain the applied measures and estimators in more detail, before we describe how these estimators were applied to data from electrophysiological recordings in the next section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mathematically formalize the estimation procedure from these data, we assume that neural time series recorded from two systems  and  (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cortical sites) can be treated as collections of realizations xt and yt of random variables Xt, Yt of two random processes X = {X1, , Xt, , XN} and Y = {Y1, , Yt, , YN}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The index t here indicates samples in time, measured in units of the dwell time (inverse sampling rate) of the recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Entropy_as_an_upper_bound_on_information_transfer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transfer entropy from Eq 1 can be rewritten as:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(7)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By dropping the negative term on the right hand side we obtain an upper bound (as already noticed by [54, P. 65]), and by realizing that a conditional entropy is always smaller than the corresponding unconditional one, we arrive at  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(8)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This indicates that the overall entropy of the source states is an upper bound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several interesting other bounds on information transfer exist as detailed in [54], yet these are considerably harder to interpret and were not the focus of the current presentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimation_of_information_theoretic_measures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this section we will describe how the information theoretic measures presented in the last section may be estimated from neural data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In doing so, we will also describe the methodological pitfalls mentioned in the introduction in more detail and we will describe how these were handled here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If not stated otherwise, we used implementations of all presented methods in the open source toolboxes TRENTOOL [23] and JIDT [53], called through custom MATLAB® scripts (MATLAB 8.0, The MathWorks® Inc., Natick, MA, 2012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time series were normalized to zero mean and unit variance before estimation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_testing_using_permutation_testing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test for statistically relevant effects of isoflurane levels and direction of interaction or recording site on estimated measures, we performed two-factorial permutation analyses of variance (pANOVA) for each animal and estimated measure [39, 6567].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a MATLAB® implementation of the test described in [67], which is compatible with the FieldTrip toolbox data format [26] and is available from [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The permutation ANOVA can be used if the normality assumptions of parametric ANOVA are violated oras in the present studyif assumptions are not testable due to too few data points per factor level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The permutation ANOVA evaluates the significance of the main effect of individual factors or their interaction effect under the null-hypothesis of no experimental effect at all.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance is evaluated by calculating a F-ratio for the effect from the original data; this original F-ratio is then compared against a distribution of F-ratios obtained from permuted data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F-ratios p-value is calculated as the fraction of ratios obtained from permuted data that is bigger than the original F-ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When permuting data, it is crucial to only permute data in such a way that the currently investigated effect is destroyed while all other effects are kept intact [65]: for example, consider a two-factorial design with factors A and Bif the main effect of factor A is to be tested, the assignment of levels of A to data points has to be permuted; yet, the permutation of levels of A can only happen within levels of factor B such as to not simultaneously destroy the effect of factor B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, when testing for the effect of one factor, the effect of all other factors is preserved, making sure that variability due to one factor is tested for while the variability due to the other factor is held constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this permutation scheme is not applicable to the interaction effect because it leaves no possible permutationsdestroying the interaction effect through permutation always also destroys the main effects of individual factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, both factors have to be permuted, which yields an approximative test of the interaction effect (see [67] for a discussion of permutation strategies and simulations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The factors in the permutation ANOVA were isoflurane level and direction for TESPO estimates, and isoflurane level and recording site for AIS and H estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of permutations was set to 10,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, data was recorded in different sessions and segmented into epochs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, estimates for individual epochs should not be pooled over recordings for statistical analysis (see for example [69], and also the next paragraph for a discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore aggregated estimates over epochs to obtain one estimate per recording session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the median to aggregate the estimated values for each recording session over individual epochs, because the distribution of measures over epochs was skewed and we considered the median a more exact representation of the distributions central tendencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aggregation of data resulted in relatively few observations per ANOVA cell and also in unequal number of observations between cells, thus violating two basic assumptions of parametric ANOVA (too few observations make it impossible to test for parametric assumptions like homogeneity of variances).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used the non-parametric permutation approach over a parametric one, because the permutation ANOVA does not make any assumptions on data structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_testing_using_linear_mixed_models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As described above, LFP recordings were conducted in epochs over multiple recording sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This introduces a so-called nested design [69], i.e., a hierarchical structure in the data, where data epochs are nested within recordings, which are nested in animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such structures lead to systematic errors or dependence within the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This violates the assumption of uncorrelated errors made by the most common tests derived from the general linear model and leads to an inflation of the type I error [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A measure of the degree of dependence is the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which was 0.35 for ferret 1 and 0.19 for ferret 2, indicating a significant dependency within the data (see [69] for a discussion of this measure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we performed an additional statistical tests where we again tested for a significant effect of the two factors isoflurane level and direction as well as their interaction, but we additionally modeled the nested structure in our data by a random factor recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a model is called a linear mixed effects model [70], and may yield higher statistical power than aggregating data within one level of the nested design (as was done for the permutation ANOVA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the following model for both animals separately:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

where yij is the TESPO value from the i-th epoch in recording j, modeled as a function of isoflurane level and direction of interaction, where 0 describes the model intercept, k are the regression coefficients and describe fixed effects, j is the random deviation of recording j from the intercept 0, and ij describes random noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Di, , and  are predictor variables, encoding factors direction as  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(13)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
and factor isoflurane level as  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(14) (15)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that we used dummy coding for factor direction so that the the estimated effect 1 can be interpreted like the simple or main effect in a standard ANOVA framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used contrast coding for factor isoflurane level which allows to interpret estimated effects 2 and 3 as deviations from a reference group (in this case the condition iso 0.0%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further assume that noise was i.i.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the R language [71] and the function lmer from the lme4-package [72] for model fitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed statistical significance of individual factors by means of model comparison using the maximum likelihood ratio between models [73].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To allow for this model comparison, we used maximum likelihood estimation, instead of restricted maximum likelihood estimation, of random and fixed effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for main effects, we compared models including individual factors isoflurane level (fm_a) and direction (fm_d) to a Null model (fm_0) including only the random effect; to furthermore test for an interaction effect, we compared the model including an interaction term (fm_axb) to a model where both factors only entered additively (fm_ab).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The models were fitted to 15,973 TESPO values from ferret 1 and 18,202 TESPO values from ferret 2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simulating_the_effect_of_reduced_source_entropy_on_transfer_entropy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether changes in source entropy influenced the transfer entropy despite unchanged coupling, we simulated two test cases, with high and low source entropy, respectively, while the coupling between source and target process were held constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simulate the two test cases, we randomly selected two recordingsone from the iso 0.0% condition, which on average showed higher source entropy, and one from the iso 1.0% condition, which on average showed lower source entropy (Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the recording from the iso 0.0% condition, we permuted epochs in the target time series to destroy all information transfer present in the original data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the permuted data, we simulated two cases of artificial coupling, first, using the high-entropy source time course from the iso 0.0% condition; and second, using the low-entropy source time course from the iso 1.0% condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling was simulated by adding a filtered, scaled and delayed version of the respective source time course to the target time course for each epoch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For filtering, we used a Gaussian filter with a smoothing of 10 samples; for the scaling factor, we used a value of 0.2, which resulted in a TESPO value for the high-entropy test case that was close to the TESPO in the iso 0.0% condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By replacing the original coupling in both recordings with a simulated coupling, we made sure that the coupling was constant for both test cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For both test cases, we estimated TESPO and  following the estimation procedures described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested differences in TESPO using a permutation independent samples t-test with 10,000 permutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make sure that our simulation reflected information transfer found in the original data, we further tested for a significant difference between TESPO in the original data from the iso 0.0% recording and TESPO in the high-entropy test case (using the source time iso 0.0% condition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we found no significant difference, indicating that the transfer entropy in our test case did not differ significantly from the transfer entropy found in the original data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Correlating_information-theoretic_measures_with_other_time-series_properties  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We correlated TESPO, AIS, and H with more conventional measures from time-series analysis, namely, the autocorrelation decay time (ACT), signal variance, and power in individual frequency bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation was performed to investigate whether information-theoretic measures captured signal properties that could be described equally well by more simple measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ACT was calculated by finding the lag at which the autocorrelation coefficient decayed below e1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal variance was calculated as the variance over time for each recording after subtracting the mean of the time series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The band power was calculated for individual frequency bands (delta = 0.54 Hz, theta = 48 Hz, alpha = 812 Hz, beta = 1230 Hz, gamma = 3040 Hz, following [47]), using the multitaper method with discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (Slepian sequences) as tapers (smoothing = 1 Hz) implemented in the MATLAB toolbox FieldTrip [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We calculated correlations between information-theoretic measures and conventional measures for individual isoflurane levels and recording sites or direction of interaction, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each correlation, we pooled data over recording sessions for the respective isoflurane level and calculated Spearmans rank correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the correlation for significance using a restricted permutation test, where permutations were allowed only within one recording, accounting for the nested experimental design (see [69] and section Statistical testing using linear mixed models, below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we calculated the correlation as well as the variance explained, R2, for individual recordings, because calculating R2 for the coefficient calculated from pooled data does not yield interpretable results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
