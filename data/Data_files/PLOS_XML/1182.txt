Investigating the case of human nose shape and climate adaptation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The evolutionary reasons for variation in nose shape across human populations have been subject to continuing debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An import function of the nose and nasal cavity is to condition inspired air before it reaches the lower respiratory tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, it is thought the observed differences in nose shape among populations are not simply the result of genetic drift, but may be adaptations to climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address the question of whether local adaptation to climate is responsible for nose shape divergence across populations, we use QstFst comparisons to show that nares width and alar base width are more differentiated across populations than expected under genetic drift alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether this differentiation is due to climate adaptation, we compared the spatial distribution of these variables with the global distribution of temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that width of the nares is correlated with temperature and absolute humidity, but not with relative humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that some aspects of nose shape may indeed have been driven by local adaptation to climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we think that this is a simplified explanation of a very complex evolutionary history, which possibly also involved other non-neutral forces such as sexual selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study of human adaptation is essential to our understanding of disease etiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolutionary investigations into why certain disease phenotypes such as sickle-cell anemia and lactose intolerance occur at different rates in different populations have led to a better understanding of the genetic and environmental risk factors involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, research into the geographical distribution of skin pigmentation continues to yield important clues regarding risk of vitamin D deficiency and skin cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we investigate whether variation in the shape of the external nose across populations has been driven by regional differences in climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that variation in both nares width and alar base width appear to have experienced accelerated divergence across human populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that the geospatial distribution of nares width is correlated with temperature, and absolute humidity, but not with relative humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results support the claim that local adaptation to climate may have had a role in the evolution of nose shape differences across human populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The shape of the nose, like many other parts of the face, varies both within as well as across human populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the distance between the nasal alare (wings of the nose) are significantly larger in individuals of West African, South Asian, and East Asian ancestry as compared to persons with European ancestry [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nasal index (width/height of the nasal aperture of the skull) is also known to vary significantly among populations [1,2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether these population differences in nose shape are due primarily to genetic drift or natural selection is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A vital function of the nose is to warm inspired air to core body temperature and saturate it with water vapor before it reaches the lower respiratory tract [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, inhaled air reaches 90% of the required temperature and humidity levels before even reaching the nasopharynx, implicating the nasal cavity as the major conditioning apparatus in the respiratory tract [4,5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conditioning acts to maintain proper functioning of the mucociliary apparatus, which functions in trapping particles and pathogens and removing them from the airways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low humidity in the respiratory tract leads to impaired mucociliary function and increases the risk of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much of the air conditioning occurs as it passes through the turbinates, the walls of which are lined with blood vessels and mucus producing goblet cells [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies have shown that the efficacy of the conditioning process depends on the flow dynamics of the inspired air, which in turn, depend on the geometry of the nasal cavity and inlets [5,7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the function of the nose as an air-conditioning apparatus, it is hypothesized that differences in nose shape across populations may have been driven by local adaptation to climate [2,3,8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are several challenges in testing this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We know there is substantial nose shape variation among human populations, in both the external morphology of the nose as well as the underlying cranial morphology [1,2,9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this can be explained by adaptation to local selection pressures, it could also be explained by the fact that phenotypic differences among geographically distant populations can arise simply due to genetic drift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in order to invoke divergent selection as an explanation, one must demonstrate that the observed variation in nose shape across human populations is greater than that expected under genetic drift alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be carried out using the Qst statistic, which measures the degree of genetic differentiation underlying a quantitative trait [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, the Qst of a neutrally evolving trait is expected to follow the Fst distribution of neutrally evolving loci [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, when Qst is much greater than Fst, trait divergence exceeds neutral expectations and can be attributed to divergent selection [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The problem with Qst is that its calculation requires knowledge of the additive genetic variances within- and among-populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These can only be estimated reliably using common-garden experiments, in which environmental effects on the phenotype can be effectively controlled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since such experiments are not possible in humans, Qst-based inference regarding divergent selection on human phenotypes necessitates making realistic assumptions about the heritabilities of the phenotypes in question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several studies have used this approach and found that while most aspects of the skull seem to be evolving neutrally, the shape of the nasal aperture appears to be more differentiated across human populations than expected under genetic drift [9,12,13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, it was also reported that the divergence in the shape of the external nose, at least between Europeans and Han Chinese populations, also exceeds neutral expectations [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this might be true, most of these studies employed anticonservative heritability assumptions, which overestimate the genetic differentiation underlying a trait, and thus, lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the relative roles of selection and drift in driving phenotypic differences among populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we carried out an exploration of external nose shape variation in light of quantitative genetic theory to investigate whether nose shape variation among populations exceeds neutral expectations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In doing so, we discuss the methodological challenges involved in tackling such questions in humans, and show how the limitations of previous studies can be addressed with recent advances in statistical genetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As proof of principle, we compare the differentiation of nose shape with two highly heritable morphological traits, which are known to have a polygenic basis; namely height and skin pigmentation [1518].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both height and skin pigmentation exhibit substantial variation within and across human populations, and are thought to be under positive selection in various populations [1922].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skin pigmentation is also a good example of a phenotype which is known to have evolved in response to a geospatially varying selection pressure: exposure to ground level ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we test whether clinal variation in aspects of nose shape, which appear to be under accelerated divergence across populations, covaries with geographic variation in temperature and humidity, in order to determine whether this divergence is due to climatic selection pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Describing_variation_in_nose_shape  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify variation in nose shape, we first captured high resolution 3D images of participants faces using the 3dMD Face system (3dMD Atlanta, GA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five positioning landmarks (two on the inner corner of the eyes, two on the outer corners of the mouth, and one on the tip of the nose) were placed in order to establish facial orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A spatially dense mesh of 7,150 quasi-landmarks (QLs) was mapped onto each image and its reflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generalized Procrustes Superimposition [24] was carried out on both sets of images (original and reflected) to remove differences in position and orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Procrustes coordinates of the original and reflected image for each participant were then averaged to remove effects of bilateral asymmetry following Claes et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2014) [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nose region, which is comprised of 709 out of the 7,150 QLs, was selected for downstream analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used linear distances and areas to characterize the shape of the nose (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear distances (measured in mm) were calculated using seven standard anthropometric landmarks: i. nasion (n), ii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pronasale (prn), iii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  subnasale (sn), iv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Left alar curvature, (all), v. right alar curvature (alr), vi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  left alar base (acl), and vii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Right alar base (acr) (Fig 1) [26,27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These seven landmarks were placed on the spatially-dense mesh of 709 QLs, which facilitated automated placement on each face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the x, y, and z coordinates of these landmarks to calculate five Euclidean distances: i. nares width (allalr), ii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  alar base width (aclacr), iii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nasal height (nsn), iv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nasal ridge length (nprn), and v. nasal tip protrusion (snprn) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also computed two areas (measured in mm2): i. total external area of the nose and ii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mean nostril area (Fig 1) (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2 shows the distribution of aspects of nose shape in males and females from four human population groups: West African, East Asian, South Asian, and Northern European.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These groups were defined based on genetic and self-reported ancestry (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 also shows the distribution of height and melanin index, a measure of skin pigmentation level derived from reflectance spectrophotometry (measured on the upper inner arms; see Methods), for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample size, mean, and standard deviation for each phenotype are provided in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One clear observation is that all aspects of nose shape, at least those considered here, are highly sexually dimorphic (Fig 2, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males, on average, tend to have wider nares, longer nasal ridges, more outwardly protruding nasal tips, bigger nostrils, and a larger overall external surface area, compared to females (Fig 2, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All nasal measurements are also significantly different across populations (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on Table 1, we note some general patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, nares width and alar base width are largest in W. Africans and smallest in N. Europeans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with previous observations [1,2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nasal tip protrusion is greatest in N. Europeans and smallest in W. Africans and E. Asians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. Asians also tend to have the smallest noses in terms of external surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Testing_for_accelerated_divergence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differences in a phenotype can accumulate across populations simply due to genetic drift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to invoke positive directional selection, one must demonstrate that the variation across populations is more than that expected under genetic drift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used Qst (see Leinonen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [28] for a recent review), the quantitative genetic analog of Fst [10,29], to test whether certain aspects of nose shape exhibit greater differentiation across populations than expected under genetic drift alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qst measures the degree of genetic differentiation in a quantitative trait across populations and is defined as:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(1)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where  and  are the components of phenotypic variance due to additive genetic effects among and within populations, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that, in principle, the distribution of Qst of a quantitative trait that has evolved under genetic drift alone is expected to be equal to Fst of neutral genetic markers [11,30,31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expectation allows one to compare Qst to Fst to test whether genetic drift alone is sufficient to explain the divergence of a trait among populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the Qst of a trait across a set of populations is much greater than Fst, it means that the phenotypic differentiation exceeds the expectation under neutrality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The components of additive genetic variance,  and , are typically estimated from common-garden experiments in which the effects due to the environment can be controlled [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is often not possible in non-model organisms, especially humans, because of practical and ethical limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such cases,  and  can be estimated from the among- and within-population components of phenotypic variance,  and , respectively, provided the heritabilities underlying these components are known:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(2)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here  and  are among- and within-population components of the phenotypic variance and c and h2 are proportions of  and , respectively, that are due to additive genetic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both c and h2 are can range from 0 (none of the variance is due to additive genetic effects) to 1 (all of the variance is due to additive genetic effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eq (2) shows that Qst calculated from phenotypic variance components depends on the ratio between c and h2 [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without prior information, it is reasonable to assume c/h2 = 1, i.e., the proportion of phenotypic variance due to additive genetic effects is the same among- and within-populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qst calculated this way is sometimes referred to as Pst [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we will continue to use the term Qst to avoid confusion and will evaluate the validity of the assumption that c/h2 = 1 in the following section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We calculated Qst for each aspect of nose shape, described in the previous section, across four human population groups: i) West African (N = 40), ii) North European (N = 236), iii) East Asian (N = 127), and iv) South Asian (N = 73) (see Methods for selection criteria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a non-parametric bootstrap approach to generate the empirical distributions of Qst and Fst and to test whether the observed value of Qst is greater than Fst (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistic we used is QstFst, which, under the null hypothesis of genetic drift, is expected to be equal to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger the QstFst of a phenotype, the stronger the evidence that the variation in the phenotype across populations is more than that expected under genetic drift alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to outliers in the neutral distribution as signals of accelerated divergence for brevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of evidence for accelerated divergence can be measured using an empirical p-value, which is the proportion of bootstrapped values of QstFst that are less than zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare with other quantitative traits with a polygenic basis, we also tested whether height and skin pigmentation exhibit signals of accelerated divergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are illustrated in Fig 3 and the p-values are listed in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treat phenotypes that pass a stringent Bonferonni correction (p-value less_than0.0071 = 0.05/7 for seven nose shape traits) as exhibiting signals of accelerated divergence across populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As expected, skin pigmentation shows a strong signal of accelerated divergence across populations (Qst = 0.642, p-value = 1.00E-04).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in accordance with the idea that differences in skin pigmentation, at least across continental populations, have been driven by positive selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Height, on the other hand, does not show signals of accelerated divergence (Qst = 0.177, p-value = 0.14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While height seems to be under positive selection within European and African populations separately [19,34], it does not appear to be driven by divergent selection pressures across the populations considered here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of all the nose shape measurements, only nares width (Qst = 0.467, p-value = 2.80E-03) and alar base width (Qst = 0.440, p-value = 4.90E-03) exhibit signals of accelerated divergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the degree of divergence in these traits is not as high as that observed for skin pigmentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evaluating_validity_of_assumptions_regarding_c_and_h2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated Qst under the assumption that c/h2 = 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, we assume that the proportion of between-population variance in the trait due to additive genetic effects is the same as the proportion of within-population variance due to additive genetic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be an incorrect assumption if a large proportion of the phenotypic variance between populations is due to direct environmental effects (i.e., phenotypic plasticity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the true value of c/h2 is drastically lower than 1, phenotype-derived estimates of the among-population genetic variance, and hence, Qst will be inflated, resulting in false-positive conclusions regarding the role of selection in driving phenotypic differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fact has largely been ignored in previous studies, in which Qst-based approaches were used to explore craniofacial divergence [1214,35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these studies, h2 was assumed to be 0.55 and c was implicitly assumed to be 1, resulting in c/h2 to be greater than 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this might be true for some traits (for example, see skin pigmentation in Table 3), this is an anticonservative approach in our opinion, because it assumes that the heritability across populations is higher than the heritability within populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If anything, the opposite case (c/h2 less_than 1) is more plausible as we expect environmental variation to be large across geographically distant populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Keeping this in mind, we evaluated the sensitivity of the QstFst results to the case where c/h2 less_than 1 [32], by determining the critical value of c/h2 at which the 95% lower bound of Qst meets the 95% upper bound of Fst (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smaller critical values imply that phenotype-based QstFst comparisons are robust to c/h2 assumptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such sensitivity analyses, while common in the molecular ecology literature, are underrepresented in human genetic and anthropological studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 shows the sensitivity curves for height, skin pigmentation, and nose shape traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skin pigmentation, which shows a very high Qst value, has a critical value of 0.25, which is much lower than 1 (Fig 4 and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical value of nares width is 0.50 and that of alar base width is 0.55, which are also much lower than 1 (Fig 4 and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we expect that these phenotypes would exhibit signals of accelerated divergence, even if the true values of c/h2 were much less than 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Investigating_heritability_of_nose_shape_within-_and_among-populations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the sensitivity analysis, we wanted to demonstrate that differences in nose shape among individuals both within- and between-populations are heritable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within-population heritability (h2) for a phenotype is traditionally estimated from data collected on large sets of twins or from pedigrees where the genetic relationships among individuals are known [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Yang and colleagues (2010) introduced a linear mixed model approach, which can be used to estimate an alternative statistic in unrelated individuals: the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genotyped SNPs (hg2) [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major advantage of this approach over traditional twin- and pedigree-based approaches is that it is applicable to data from unrelated individuals, which are more accessible and easier to collect in large numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated hg2 as an estimate of h2 for height, melanin index, and nose shape traits using 118,420 autosomal SNPs in a sample of unrelated persons of European ancestry, implemented in the GCTA software [37] (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values of hg2 are provided in Table 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heritability for height in Europeans (hg2 = 0.394; N = 1,825) is similar to previously reported estimates [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the heritability of skin pigmentation is very low in Europeans (hg2 = 0.191; N = 1,231), which we think can be explained by reduced genetic variation at skin pigmentation loci due to strong positive selection for lighter skin in Europeans [17,21,38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Almost all aspects of nose shape seem to be highly heritable in Europeans (hg2 range: 0.4010.657 N = 1,718) (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Estimation of the among-population heritability (c) is more difficult, since genetic effects between geographically distant populations can be confounded with large environmental effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This parameter can often only be reliably estimated through common garden experiments, in which systematic differences in the environment, which might be confounded with genetic differences, can be taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as mentioned earlier, this approach is only possible in model organisms, which are amenable to experimental manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans and other non-model organisms, this is a severe limitation, which can be overcome by studying naturally occurring admixed populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The process of admixture reunites gene pools from two or more populations, which might have diverged due to genetic drift, mutation, and selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Admixture, which may occur repeatedly over several generations, followed by recombination, leads to chromosomes that are essentially mosaics of ancestry segments (Fig 5) [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a randomly mating admixed population, ancestry segments segregate randomly with respect to the environment, which decouples the between-population genetic effects on the phenotype from the environmental effects, allowing for the estimation of the genetic variance underlying a phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that a method recently developed to estimate heritability in admixed populations (Zaitlen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2014)) [40], might provide a valid estimate of c. Zaitlen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2014) extend the method developed by Yang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2010) [18], using local ancestry at SNPs, instead of genotypes, to construct the genetic relationship matrix among admixed individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of phenotypic variance in an admixed population that can be explained by local ancestry (hy2) is conceptually equivalent to c between the parental populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our reasoning is that, on a genotypic level, the genetic variation in an admixed population should be the sum of the genetic variation within the parental populations and the genetic variation between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation at the scale of local ancestry only represents genetic variation between populations (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be explained by local ancestry (hy2), should be equivalent to c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following this reasoning, we estimated hy2 from local ancestry at 623,625 autosomal SNPs in a sample of 409 Cape Verdeans, who derive their ancestry primarily from W. Africans and Europeans (see Methods for details and Table 3 for results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 3 shows that the phenotypic variation between W. Africans and Europeans in height (hy2 = 0.224, N = 409) is quite heritable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results for skin pigmentation data are not presented here as they were unavailable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in many aspects of nose shape are also heritable (Nares width: hy2 = 0.226, Alar base width: hy2 = 0.212, Nasal tip protrusion: 0.177, External surface area: hy2 = 0.121, N = 409).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other aspects of nose shape may not be as heritable between these two populations (Nasal height: hy2 = 0.03, hy2 = 0.059, N = 409).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another interesting observation from Table 3 is that estimates of hy2 are generally lower than estimates of hg2 for all traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that for most human traits, the additive genetic variance between populations might be less than the additive genetic variance within populations, which agrees with the fact that most of the genetic variation in humans exists within populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we are cautious of over-stating this conclusion since the heritabilities were estimated in individuals with W. African and European ancestry only and do not reflect the variation within and across other populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our results show that genetic differences underlie the variation in many aspects of nose shape, both within- and between-populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Testing_for_adaptation_to_climate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously, several studies have shown that the shapes of the nasal aperture and nasal cavity are correlated with climate variables related to temperature and humidity such that individuals from cold-dry climates exhibit narrower nasal cavities compared to individuals from warm-humid climates [41,42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were interested in testing whether aspects of external nose shape showing unusually high differentiation across populations based on QstFst analysis, show correlations with climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we selected, from the subset used in the Qst analysis, females with genetic data whose parents were born in a region that coincided with their continental ancestry (N = 140) (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was done to assign to each individual, a climate value that was most similar to their ancestral climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we did not have genotype data available for males of Northern European ancestry, we only used females for this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genotype data were necessary to correct for genetic structure (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the correlation of nares width and alar base width with three climate variables: i) mean annual temperature (hereafter referred to as temperature), ii) relative humidity, and iii) absolute humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choice of these climate variables follows from the functional importance of the nose in warming and humidifying inspired air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested whether skin pigmentation is correlated with UVB levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was used as proof of principle, since multiple lines of evidence suggest that differences in skin pigmentation across populations have evolved primarily in response to ultraviolet radiation [17,2022].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between phenotypes and climate variables was tested using linear mixed models, which correct for age, BMI, and genetic similarity (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex was not included as a covariate as only females were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a likelihood ratio test (LRT) to evaluate the statistical significance of the slope between phenotype and climate variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LRT statistic and its corresponding p-values were generated by comparing full (climate predictor included) and reduced (climate predictor removed) models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are presented in Table 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As expected, we see a strong relationship between skin pigmentation and UVB (N = 126, T = 6.23, LRT = 55.20, p-value = 1.09E-13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positive values of the slope and t-statistic indicate that people tend to be darker in regions with higher exposure to UVB and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern provides further support to the notion that adaptation to ultraviolet radiation has had an important role in the evolution of skin pigmentation in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nares width is significantly correlated with temperature (N = 140, T = 3.09, LRT = 9.24, p-value = 2.37E-03) and absolute humidity (N = 140, T = 2.73, LRT = 7.28, p-value = 6.97E-03).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positive slopes indicate that individuals from warm-humid climates, on average, tend to have wider nares whereas individuals from cool-dry climates tend to have narrower nares.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with previously reported patterns of ecogeographic variation in the width of the nasal aperture and nasal cavity [41,42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nares width was not significantly correlated with relative humidity (N = 140, T = -1.65, LRT = 2.71, p-value = 0.100).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not surprising since absolute humidity is more important for the physiological functioning of the nose than relative humidity [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alar base width is neither significantly correlated with temperature (N = 140, T = 1.97, LRT = 3.82, p-value = 0.051) nor with relative humidity (N = 140, T = -0.79, LRT = 0.62, p-value = 0.431), and is only mildly correlated with absolute humidity (N = 140, T = 2.09, LRT = 4.30, p-value = 0.038).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might suggest that it is not the width of the nose per se but the width of the nares that is under selection pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even nares width is not as strongly correlated with temperature and humidity as skin pigmentation is to UVB, suggesting that the strength of selection exerted by temperature on nose width is likely to be much weaker than the selection pressure imposed by UVB exposure on skin pigmentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following a suggestion by one of the reviewers, we investigated whether the observed phenotype-climate correlations were driven by any one population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we re-estimated the phenotype-climate slopes (skin pigmentation vs UVB and nares width vs temperature) after removing each population in turn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 7 shows that the 95% confidence intervals of the slope overlap with zero (red line in Fig 7) only when the N. Europeans are removed, suggesting that both phenotype-climate correlations are driven primarily by the inclusion of N. Europeans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect might be indicative of positive selection for lighter skin pigmentation and narrower nares in higher latitude populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because our sampling of populations at higher latitude is limited (Fig 6), this result requires further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The diversity of facial features across human populations has fascinated scientists for a long time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though genetic drift has played a predominant role in human evolution, external physical traits such as facial shape and skin pigmentation, because of their proximity to the environment, have also likely been influenced by natural selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substantial evidence has accumulated supporting the hypothesis that differences in skin pigmentation across human populations have evolved largely in response to selection pressures imposed by exposure to ultraviolet radiation [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How selection may have affected facial shape, a trait that is also quite variable between populations, is unclear, likely because it has received much less attention to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the complexity of the face, we have chosen to study one particularly interesting and variable part of the face; the nose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broad question driving this study is: Has climate adaptation played an important role in influencing variation in human nose shape?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To answer this question, we formulated two hypotheses: i. divergent selection has been involved in the differentiation of certain aspects of nose shape across populations, and ii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  climate is the agent of selection in cases where divergent selection can be invoked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the first hypothesis, we used QstFst comparisons to investigate whether the mean difference in nose shape among populations is greater than that expected under genetic drift alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimation of Qst relies on stipulating the within- and among-population components of phenotypic variance that are due to additive genetic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These variance components are ideally calculated through experiments in which the effects of environmental variables can be controlled [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This poses a practical and ethical challenge in non-model organisms, such as humans, who are not amenable to the type of experimentation required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To circumvent these limitations, studies often calculate Qst directly from phenotype data under the assumption that the within-population heritability (h2) is equal to the among-population heritability (c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qst calculated this way is probably best considered to be the minimum Qst proposed by Relethford (1994) [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the notion that this takes the minimum value of Qst relies on h2 always being less than c, which is anticonservative as has been noted previously [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, genetic variation between-populations is likely to be less than the genetic variation within-populations for most phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach is similar to previous studies in that we also estimated Qst assuming c = h2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we used sensitivity curves to evaluate the behavior of Qst to cases where c less_than h2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we demonstrate that both within- and between-population variation in nose shape are heritable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We carried out QstFst comparisons for seven nose shape traits: nares width, alar base width, nasal height, length of the nasal ridge, nasal tip protrusion, external surface area, and nostril area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the divergence in the width of the nares and alar base deviate from neutral expectations, and that these results are robust to the c = h2 assumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the width of the nares and alar base may have evolved across populations due to divergent selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we hypothesized that the divergence of these two traits is driven by climate adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this, we tested whether the spatial distribution of these traits is correlated with mean annual temperature and humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that nares width is strongly correlated with temperature and absolutely humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positive direction of the effects indicate that wider noses are more common in warm-humid climates, while narrower noses are more common in cold-dry climates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nares width is not, however, correlated with relative humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not surprising since absolute humidity levels are likely more important for respiration than relative humidity [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alar base width is only weakly, if at all, correlated with temperature and absolute humidity, suggesting that the signal of climate adaptation might be specific to the width of the nares.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies show that the geometry of the nose is important for its respiratory functions [5,44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhaled air reaches 90% of the required temperature and humidity levels before even reaching the nasopharynx, implicating the nasal cavity, especially the turbinates, as the major conditioning apparatus in the respiratory tract [4,5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also know that the geometry of the nasal airways influences the velocity of inspired air [4,7,45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Narrow airways in cold-dry climates might allow better conditioning by increasing the turbulence in inspired air as it reaches the turbinates, thereby facilitating contact with the nasal mucosa [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we note that nostril area does not show unusually high differentiation across populations, which suggests that it is not the size of the nostrils but the shape that might be functionally important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another hypothesis regarding the function of the nose that has received less attention compared to the air-conditioning hypothesis is that of selective brain cooling (SBC) [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some large mammals are known to regulate brain temperatures in hyperthermic conditions, often caused by sustained exercise [47,48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ability is mostly reported in mammals with a carotid rete, which is a network of capillaries in a cavity under the brain called the cavernous sinus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arterial blood leaving the rete eventually perfuses the brain through the Circle of Willis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Venous blood traveling back from the nasal mucosa interacts with the carotid rete in the cavernous sinus and is thought to cool the blood entering the brain in arid-zone mammals, such as Oryx [49], as well as in winter-acclimatized animals, such as reindeer [50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, humans do not possess such a rete and instead have a single artery going through the cavernous sinus, which has led some to question the role of SBC in humans [51], proponents argue that the carotid rete is not a pre-requisite as SBC is present in some animals who dont possess a rete, such as horses [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since SBC in humans is highly debated, the role of nose shape differences in contributing to differences to this physiological process, while worth mentioning here, is highly speculative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Climate may not have been the only factor in contributing to nose shape differences across populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, we show that temperature is only weakly correlated with nares width, especially when compared with the correlation between skin pigmentation and UVB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What then could be the selective agent driving the divergence of nose shape?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We mentioned earlier that all aspects of nose shape studied here are sexually dimorphic, which raises a number of questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why does this sexual dimorphism exist?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Is it merely a by-product of circulating hormones leading to differences in growth and development in early adulthood, or does it have an adaptive function, such as signaling sex to other males and females?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sexual selection has likely played an important role in human evolution, as evidenced by the presence of sexual dimorphism in many physical traits (e.g., height, waist-hip ratio, facial hair, and breasts to name a few).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Could cultural differences in perceptions of dominance and attractiveness have had a role in the divergence of nose shape [53]?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Could these perceptions have arisen to select mates who signal adaptation to the local environment?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, ecological selection and sexual selection could reinforce each other, accelerating phenotypic divergence across populations in spite of continued gene flow [54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are interesting avenues of research, which need to be considered in order to sketch out a more complete picture of the evolution of the human nose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The investigation of nose shape evolution with respect to climate adaptation, while interesting anthropologically, is also relevant medically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As humans are becoming more of a global community, the study of local adaptation is becoming more important to understanding health risks involved in living in foreign climates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obvious examples of such health risks are of increased risk of sunburn, skin cancer, and folate deficiency in light-skinned individuals exposed to high UVB, and of low birth weight and chronic mountain sickness associated with hypoxia at high altitudes [20,55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Does the morphology of the external nose, or that of the inner nasal cavity affect risk of respiratory disease in different climates?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its difficult to say at this point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While our findings provide support for the idea that differences in aspects of nose shape may have evolved across populations as a result of climate-related selection pressures, something that has been demonstrated previously using craniometric data [2,12,13,41,42], we note that the signal of climate adaptation is not very strong, especially when compared to skin pigmentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be due to weaker selection pressure or selection on standing variation, but also due the sparse sampling of populations shown here, which is a limitation of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results will need to be replicated in a larger set of populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that studies incorporating diverse populations who have been living long-term in a range of environments, such as the tropics, deserts, and circumpolar regions, will nicely fill in the gaps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Especially useful would be representation of populations from higher altitude regions, such as Andeans, Tibetans, and Ethiopians, who not only have to cope with the stress of a cold and dry climate, but also that of low atmospheric oxygen levels [56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would also be informative to study non-human primates in this context, who occupy a variety of climes and exhibit extensive variation in nose morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, future studies should also focus on genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify variants contributing to nose shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increasing interest in identifying loci associated with facial shape, some GWASs have recently identified a number of nose shape loci [5760].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic variation at these loci will be informative about the nature of selection, as well as for inferring the timing of selection events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The data used in this paper are part of a larger dataset that were collected in various locations through studies based at the Pennsylvania State University and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of these data were collected in the United States at the Pennsylvania State University, at the World Science Festival in New York, and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data collection in Europe took place in Dublin (Ireland), in Rome (Italy), in Warsaw (Poland), and in Porto (Portugal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cape Verdean data were collected in collaboration with Dr. Sandra Beleza as described in Beleza et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data were collected through informed consent from the participants with approval from the institutional review boards at The Pennsylvania State University, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the National Ethical Committee for Health Research of Cape Verde.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phenotype data collected include three dimensional (3D) images, skin pigmentation, standing height, and body weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3D images of participants were taken using the 3dMD system (3dMD System, Atlanta, GA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skin pigmentation was measured with melanin index using Derma Spectrometer (Cortex Technology, Hadsund, Denmark).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melanin index is defined as the 100 x log10 (1/percentage reflectance at 650 nM) [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We took three readings of melanin index from the inner left and right arm and used the mean of the six measurements for each individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical testing was performed using the inverse of melanin index since it is more normally distributed (S7 Fig) but the use of untransformed melanin index produces similar results and does not affect our conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Demographic information was collected through questionnaires and included self-reported ancestry and sex, participants birthplace, the birthplaces of the parents and grandparents, and the locations where the participant was raised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The total number of participants was 4,257.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, we selected 2,637 individuals based on genetic ancestry and availability of phenotypic and covariate data, as described in the following sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A summary of the sample sizes used in different analyses is provided in Table 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a more detailed and accurate representation, refer to the Excel spreadsheet in the supplementary materials (S1 File), which provides individual-level data for all samples used to generate the results presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
