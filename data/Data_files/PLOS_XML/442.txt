A New 13 Million Year Old Gavialoid Crocodylian from Proto-Amazonian Mega-Wetlands Reveals Parallel Evolutionary Trends in Skull Shape Linked to Longirostry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gavialoid crocodylians are the archetypal longirostrine archosaurs and, as such, understanding their patterns of evolution is fundamental to recognizing cranial rearrangements and reconstructing adaptive pathways associated with elongation of the rostrum (longirostry).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The living Indian gharial Gavialis gangeticus is the sole survivor of the group, thus providing unique evidence on the distinctive biology of its fossil kin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary ecology spanning ~70 million-years of longirostrine crocodylian diversification remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of cranial anatomy of a new proto-Amazonian gavialoid, Gryposuchus pachakamue sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., from the Miocene lakes and swamps of the Pebas Mega-Wetland System reveals that acquisition of both widely separated and protruding eyes (telescoped orbits) and riverine ecology within South American and Indian gavialoids is the result of parallel evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic and morphometric analyses show that, in association with longirostry, circumorbital bone configuration can evolve rapidly for coping with trends in environmental conditions and may reflect shifts in feeding strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results support a long-term radiation of the South American forms, with taxa occupying either extreme of the gavialoid morphospace showing preferences for coastal marine versus fluvial environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early biogeographic history of South American gavialoids was strongly linked to the northward drainage system connecting proto-Amazonian wetlands to the Caribbean region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Numerous unresolved issues hinder understanding of the origin, time of divergence, and patterns of adaptive radiation of gavialoid crocodylians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas molecular data sets favor a close relationship and an Eocene [1] or even Neogene [24] divergence between the Indian gharial Gavialis gangeticus and the Indonesian false gharial Tomistoma schlegelii, morphological phylogenies suggest that: 1) these two extant longirostrine species are much more distantly related, 2) their elongated skulls evolved convergently, and 3) the oldest fossil gavialoid dates back to the Cretaceous Period in North America, Europe, and Africa [5,6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, analyses of extant Gavialis and its nearest fossil relatives do not provide strong support for their phylogenetic affinities with any other crocodylian clade, probably as part of what Clark [7] called the longirostrine problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clark [7] identified several cranial features related to longirostry in crocodyliforms that might have appeared independently in different groups, including possessing widely separated and protruding eyes, namely telescoped orbits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potential convergent evolution of this distinctive cranial morphotype in gavialoids not only obscured the ancestral anatomical condition for the entire clade, but also created a challenge for deciphering ingroup affinities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Indian Gavialis and South American Gryposuchus species are extremely similar in cranial morphology and both have fully telescoped orbits [8,9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this distinctive pattern results from common or independent origin has been uncertain and debated [6,10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe a gavialoid with non-telescoped orbits from the Middle Miocene of the Pebas Formation of northeastern Peru, that provides evidence of early morphological stages of the evolution of the Gryposuchus lineage in the Amazonian Neotropics relevant to resolving shared or independent origin of telescoped orbits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new gavialoid is the only longirostrine species in the hyperdiverse crocodylian community that inhabited lakes, swamps, and deltas of the Pebas Mega-Wetland System [11], a huge proto-Amazonian biome that appears to have played a crucial role for marine to freshwater transitions in many vertebrate groups occurring today in various river drainage systems of tropical South America [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its lineage survived within the paleo-Orinoco drainage throughout the Late Miocene, providing further evidence for the persistence of Pebas-like mega-wetland conditions in aquatic environments of northernmost South America [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These records highlight the biogeographic role of the long-lasting drainage linking western proto-Amazonia with the Caribbean region prior to onset of the eastward flowing, transcontinental Amazonian River system approximately 10.5 million years ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyze the phylogenetic relationships of this new Pebasian species to test whether parallel evolution occurred within an adaptive radiation of Indian and South American gavialoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mapping our phylogenetic hypothesis onto a morphometric space, the pattern of the remarkable taxonomic and anatomical diversification of South American forms provides novel insights into the ecological significance underlying circumorbital skull configurations throughout gavialoid history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Natural History Museum of National University of San Marcos (MUSM), Lima, Peru, provided all permits for this study and houses permanently the specimens from the Pebas Formation described in this publication (Credential Number MUSM 20088).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data has been collected, prepared and deposited in this public national Peruvian repository by the authors of the article.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current data is based only in fossil specimens, to which it has been assigned a specific catalog number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimen numbers are MUSM 1981, MUSM 987, MUSM 900, MUSM 1681, MUSM 2032, MUSM 1988, MUSM 1727, MUSM 1439, MUSM 2407, MUSM 1428, MUSM 1435, MUSM 1440, MUSM 1682, MUSM 1993, MUSM 2470, MUSM 2471, MUSM 2472.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these Peruvian fossil specimens are completely available in this public repository.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The context information for each fossil specimen is saved in an internal database of the repository institution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phylogenetic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the phylogenetic relationships of the new Pebasian gavialoid species, we included it in a data matrix of morphological characters revised and updated from Salas-Gismondi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [11], that built on characters initially developed by Brochu [13,14] and Jouve [6], as well as additional characters compiled from other contributions (S1 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present analysis focuses on testing the phylogenetic relationships among gavialoid crocodylians rather than more broadly across all Crocodylia as in the former analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete data matrix consists of 206 morphological characters for 42 eusuchian taxa, with Bernissartia fagesii as an outgroup and including most members of the gavialoid clade but only representative taxa of Brevirostres (S1 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This matrix was analyzed with maximum parsimony methods using TNT 1.1 [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All characters had equal weighting and were treated as unordered and non-additive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess nodal support, branches with a minimum length of 0 were collapsed and Bremer support values (decay indices) were calculated and shown on the strict consensus phylogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cranial_circumorbital_morphospace_analysis_and_phylogenetic_mapping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to understand morphological evolution linked to longirostry, we applied a geometric morphometric approach to analysis of the circumorbital anatomy of 22 species of crocodylians, including extant and extinct species (S1 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the circumorbital region has shown only minor intraspecific variation within extant adult crocodylians [16], all taxa are represented by one fully adult specimen, each preserving in dorsal view: (1) rostral sutures, (2) orbital shape pattern, and (3) no significant postmortem distortion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphometric analyses require complete datasets for all landmarks, thus MUSM 1981 was partially reconstructed from the morphology of the complete left side via geometric reflection [17], and included in the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected twenty discrete landmark loci based on their availability, relative co-planarity, and clear demarcation within images (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-dimensional landmark digitization, Procrustes superimposition, and principal component analyses (PCA) were performed with the Geomorph package in R software [18, 19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 22 landmark configurations were superimposed and scaled to unit centroid size following the generalized Procrustes method [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coordinates of the superimposed configurations were later imported into the Euclidean tangent shape space for subsequent statistical analysis [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to determine components of shape variation, the 22 principal components from that analysis were obtained by applying a principal component analysis (PCA) on the variance covariance of the projected coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal component axes (PCs) 1 and 2 (estimated cumulative variance = 70.6%) were plotted in principal components space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simplified version of the parsimony-based phylogenetic hypothesis unweighted for branch length and including only the taxa sampled for the twenty landmarks, was mapped in the circumorbital morphospace with MorphoJ software [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Geological_Context__Paleoenvironment__and_Age  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the study area, the Pebas Formation is comprised of transgressive and regressive bay-margin deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parasequences are formed by fossiliferous blue to gray clays interbedded with unconsolidated sands, which are typically capped by lignite layers and mollusc shell beds [2224].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lacustrine brackish-water, sometimes tidally influenced, mega-wetland deposits are indicated by most of the studies in the lower and middle parts of the Pebas Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time span of the Pebas Formation ranges approximately from the early Miocene (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23 Ma) to the early Late Miocene (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10.5 Ma) [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biostratigraphic framework of the Pebas Formation is based on pollen, ostracod, and particularly on the abundant and diverse molluscan faunas preserved throughout the unit [2628].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fossiliferous deposits are located along the Amazon River banks and tributaries of the so-called Iquitos Arch, which corresponds to the modern forebulge of the northwestern Amazonia foreland basin [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fossil vertebrates are found mainly in lignitic bonebeds [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These localities (IQ) are mapped within the Molluscan Zones (MZ) proposed by Wesselingh et al., [28] for the study area (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the gavialoid remains come from localities IQ26 and IQ114, and correspond to MZ8 (late Middle Miocene; ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These localities have documented the highest diversity within any single known extant or fossil crocodylian community, including the shoveling mollusc-crushing caiman Gnatusuchus pebasensis, as well as Kuttanacaiman iquitosensis, Caiman wannlangstoni, Purussaurus neivensis, Mourasuchus atopus, Paleosuchus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [11], and the new gavialoid taxon described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other fossil vertebrate remains, such as fishes, aquatic turtles, and mammals, also are abundant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IQ116 is a less productive locality than IQ26 and IQ114, but might correspond to the same time interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This later outcrop is restricted to a 12 meter thick capping lignite level overlying a grey mud with shell beds [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two specimens of the new Pebasian gavialoid, MUSM 1681 and MUSM 1682, were found in locality IQ136, probably corresponding to MZ5 (Middle Miocene; ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1615 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are the oldest gavialoids known from the Amazon Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional gavialoid specimen, MUSM 987 was unearthed at IQ101, in the Momón River banks, and might correspond in age to MZ6 (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1514 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pebas Formation deposits represent a highly dynamic mosaic of shallow aquatic settings (e.g., lakes, swamps, and rivers) of varying salinity and marine influence [2932], and dysoxic muddy bottoms within lakes and swamps were common in the Pebas System.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several gavialoid bones, including a diagnostic postorbital bone (MUSM 2430) belonging to Gryposuchus colombianus or Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  croizati, were found at locality IQ125 in the Nueva Unión area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This locality belongs to the Uppermost Pebas Formation (Fig 1) [11,33] and might correspond to MZ9 or younger intervals (Middle-Late Miocene boundary; ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1211 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outcrops there consist of fine-grained fluvial sandstones, floodplain clays and silts, and paleosols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These levels are lignite-poor and lack mollusc remains [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spatial distribution of the Molluscan Zones (MZ) [28] and fossil bearing localities (IQ) within the Pebas Formation and the Uppermost Pebas Formation is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geological data from [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Among the copious gavialoid material reported from the Late Miocene Urumaco Formation of Venezuela, we identified a taxon consistent in morphology with the new Pebasian gavialoid [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Urumaco Formation consists of complex intercalation of sandstone, organic-rich mudstone, coal, shale, and thick-bedded coquinoidal limestones with abundant mollusc fragments [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Urumaco specimen comprises a partial skull (AMU CURS 12; Fig 2D) collected within the upper member of the Urumaco Formation, at the Domo de Agua Blanca Locality [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This member is characterized by organic-rich, dark-gray laminated mudstone and shale, and abundant vertebrate fragments [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper member of the Urumaco Formation was deposited in a delta plain [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The type of Gryposuchus pachakamue (MUSM 1981; Table 1) is a well-preserved skull, only slightly distorted in the right orbital region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It lacks most of the temporal and occipital bones, as well as the pterygoid flanges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skull table is incomplete in the holotype, but well preserved in the referred specimens MUSM 1681 (Table 1) and MUSM 2032, and partially distorted in MUSM 900 (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preserved length (from tip of the snout to the posterior angle of left supratemporal fenestra) of the type skull is 623.2 mm (Fig 1A1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other referred specimens (MUSM 1440, MUSM 987, MUSM 2032, MUSM 1428, MUSM 1681, MUSM 2407, MUSM 2472, MUSM 2470, and MUSM 2471; Table 2), including cranial and mandibular remains, represent individuals of equivalent size to the holotype with the exception of MUSM 900, which is a larger skull lacking the anterior half of the snout (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, MUSM 1439, MUSM 1727, MUSM 1993, MUSM 1682, and MUSM 1988 comprise specimens that are notably smaller in size, with features typically associated with juvenile morphology, and herein referred to Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pachakamue (Fig 3C, 3G and 3H) as likely juvenile individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The description of the mandible is mainly based on MUSM 987, a complete right mandible corresponding to an individual of equivalent size to the holotype (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This specimen only lacks the coronoid bone and posterior end of the retroarticular process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parts of the posterior lamina of the splenial that are in contact with the surangular are missing or collapsed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No postcranial material has been not definitively identified as pertaining to this new species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Anatomy_of_the_orbital_region_in_gavialoids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Circumorbital bones include the frontal, prefrontals, lacrimals, jugals, and postorbitals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The configuration of these bones determines the orbital shape and the general position of the eyeballs in crocodylians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the adult individuals of Gryposuchus pachakamue, the orbits are slightly wider than long, closer in shape to those of Eogavialis africanus than to the circular orbits of Gavialis and other Gryposuchus species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the adult condition, the orbital shape and proportions of a juvenile specimen (MUSM 1988; Fig 3C) resemble those of most crocodylians, including gavialoids such as Piscogavialis and Eothoracosaurus, in which the orbits are comparatively longer anteroposteriorly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative diameter of the interorbital bridge (i.e., frontal bone width/orbital width ratio) defines the separation between the orbits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brevirostrine crocodylians, Eogavialis, Piscogavialis, and Ikanogavialis generally bear a narrow interorbital bridge diameter (i.e., ratio less_than1.0) compared to Gryposuchus pachakamue, in which the width of the frontal bone is essentially equivalent to the width of the orbit and this ratio is consistently higher (more slender interorbital bridge) than that of adult Gavialis and other species of Gryposuchus (i.e., ratio 1; Fig 3 and Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dorsal orbital margins are upturned in many alligatoroids and crocodyloids [13,16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among gavialoids, Eogavialis, Gryposuchus pachakamue, Piscogavialis, and Siquisiquesuchus have also upturned dorsal orbital margins, but to a lesser degree than in Ikanogavialis, Gavialis, and other Gryposuchus species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these latter taxa, dorsal and posterior margins are sharp and projected towards the orbits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the anterior orbital margin (i.e., lacrimal bones) of Eogavialis, Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pachakamue, and Piscogavialis lies flush with the rostral surface contrasting with the raised anterior margins of other gavialoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The jugals of Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pachakamue differ from those of other Gryposuchus species and most other gavialoids, more closely resembling the general pattern of non-gavialoid crocodylians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gavialoids such as Gryposuchus colombianus, Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  croizati, Ikanogavialis, Gavialis, and to a lesser degree Siquisiquesuchus, present a deep notch immediately anterior to the postorbital pillar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in non-gavialoid crocodylians and some gavialoids such as Gryposuchus pachakamue, Eothoracosaurus, Eosuchus, and Piscogavialis, the jugal orbital rim progressively descends lateral to the postorbital pillar, thus in those taxa the ventral margin of the orbit is gently circular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, in those taxa as well as in Siquisiquesuchus, the postorbital pillar reaches the horizontal bar of the jugal medially and a longitudinal sulcus is present between these structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter condition also differs from a distinctive feature observed in many other gavialoids, such as Gavialis and other Gryposuchus species, in which the postorbital bar lies flush with the lateral surface of the jugal (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postorbital bones on the skull table are relatively flat in Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pachakamue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They form the anterior corner of the skull table and lack the anterolateral postorbital process characteristic of Gavialis, Gryposuchus colombianus, and Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  neogaeus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, in contrast to the relatively conservative morphology of the orbital region of most brevirostrine crocodylians, all gavialoids present conspicuous modifications within the circumorbital anatomy associated with possessing protruding eyes or telescoped orbits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of development of the telescoped orbit condition varies among gavialoid taxa and usually includes at least some of the following character states: upturned anterior, dorsal, and posterior orbital margins; anterolateral postorbital process; ventral orbital margin with a prominent notch; postorbital pillar laterally displaced; and orbits widely separated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult Gavialis, Gryposuchus colombianus, and Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  croizati possess all of these traits and therefore the fully telescoped orbit condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Juvenile individuals of Gavialis lack widely separated orbits; other characters associated with the telescoped orbits condition are recognized but they are less marked than in adult skulls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general configuration of this area in the new gavialoid Gryposuchus pachakamue depicts weak development of telescoped orbits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is interpreted as an incipient condition for more extensive telescoping of the orbits in later diverging relatives, based on ancestral state transformations determined from the maximum parsimony phylogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our first parsimony analysis retained 45 equally optimal trees with a minimum length of 538 steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strict consensus phylogeny (Fig 7A) calculated from those trees yielded the following statistics: length = 553; consistency index (CI) = 0.461; retention index (RI) = 0.743.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our strict consensus tree shows general coincidence with previous morphological and molecular analyses for major relationships within crocodylian clades [5,6,13], but as in other morphological analyses, it differs markedly from results based only on molecular data in the hypothesized affinities between Gavialis and Tomistoma (see Results in [3,4]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we found strong Bremer support for the monophyly of Gavialoidea, with Gavialis having a much closer relationship to Cretaceous gavialoid taxa such as Eothoracosaurus than to extant Tomistoma, the latter being most closely allied with Crocodylus within the Crocodyloidea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the Alligatoroidea, Culebrasuchus mesoamericanus is closer to Alligator mississippiensis than to Caiman crocodilus [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The new Pebasian species, Gryposuchus pachakamue, is recovered within gavialoids as the sister taxon of the Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  colombianus + Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  croizati clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results suggest that all known Amazonian gavialoids belong to a single monophyletic taxon (the inclusive species of Gryposuchus) characterized by association with riverine and lacustrine-tidal paleoenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, relationships among South American taxa usually associated with coastal marine paleoenvironments show no resolution: Siquisiquesuchus, Piscogavialis, and Ikanogavialis lie in a polytomy together with Amazonian Gryposuchus and Indo-Asian Gavialis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, this first analysis finds no support for the monophyly of a clade comprising South American gavialoids, as had been suggested by previous studies [10,39,49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clade, namely Gryposuchinae as proposed by Vélez-Juarbe et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [39], was usually linked only with weak support or collapsed when the analysis included Argochampsa [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that we found support, although low, for a novel association between African Argochampsa and the Caribbean taxon Aktiogavialis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clade is supported by the presence of long supratemporal fenestrae (character 1910), a character state that implies a reversal within these gavialoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be considered problematic since Argochampsa, as an early representative of the clade, could have retained the ancestral condition for Crocodylia if character polarization based on the phylogenetic position of thoracosaurs is erroneous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, further comparisons between Argochampsa and Aktiogavialis allows us to recognize other similarities not yet included in phylogenetic analyses, but potentially supporting their close relationship, such as the relative proportions of the skull table in dorsal view and the presence of a distinctive shallow fossa in the anterior margin of the supratemporal fenestra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fossa has not been identified in any other crocodylian species at any ontogenetic stage [39], but it is clearly visible in the holotype of both Argochampsa and Aktiogavialis, although barely discernable in other individuals of the African taxon Argochampsa (Stéphane Jouve, pers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  comm., 2015).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Argochampsa + Aktiogavialis group is found as most closely related to the clade of South American gavialoids plus Indo-Asian Gavialis, and with Eogavialis as the nearest outgroup to all of these taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, African Argochampsa is more closely related to Indo-Asian Gavialis as was previously suggested by others [6,9], than it is to African Eogavialis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, both Paleogene African taxa, Argochampsa and Eogavialis, share key characters with more anatomically-derived gavialoids like Gavialis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clade encompassing this subset of late-diverging gavialoids is here termed gharials (Fig 7) and it is characterized by a posteriorly pointing supraoccipital (character 1601), anteroposteriorly wide basisphenoid (character 1721), robust exoccipital ventral process to basioccipital tubera (character 1761), and basioccipital plate with ventrally divergent sides (character 1961).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other conspicuous features of the gavialoid temporal region present in Gryposuchus pachakamue, such as ovoid infratemporal fenestra (character 2041) and anteriorly flaring squamosal groove (character 1471), also are observed in the tomistomine Thecachampsa americana and might represent independent, convergent acquisitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in most crocodylians, the infratemporal fenestra is triangular in Gavialis (character 1470), and is most parsimoniously regarded as a reversal in this latter taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paleocene Eosuchus and Cretaceous thoracosaurs from the northern hemisphere are identified in this analysis as the first and second basalmost diverging branches among the gavialoids, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better understand morphological transformations, we performed a second analysis, this time excluding individual characters revealed in the first analysis as highly homoplastic, since results suggested that they were acquired independently up to three times among later-diverging gavialoids, including Gryposuchus and Gavialis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, this analysis collapsed states of character 138 (as they may not be independent) and deleted state 2 from character 137, both of which describe morphology of the orbital margin associated with telescoped orbits, which the all-data parsimony analysis indicate clearly evolved multiple times independently within gavialoids (see Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding character 138, two states were combined in this second analysis as all taxa with state 2 also preserve state 1 (non-independent states), and all taxa previously coded as having state 2 (i.e., 1382: dorsal and posterior orbital edges upturned) were recoded as 1 (i.e., 1381: dorsal edges of orbits upturned).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This search retained 24 equally optimal trees, with a length of 533 steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding strict consensus tree is 542 steps long (CI = 0.467; RI = 0.750; Fig 7B and S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compared to the first analysis, this approach substantially increased resolution of South American gavialoid relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monophyly of gryposuchines, exclusive of the Caribbean taxon Aktiogavialis, is recovered and Gavialis is identified as the sister clade of gryposuchines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Character support for the gryposuchines includes having four premaxillary alveoli (character 871), lack of exposure of the prootic on external braincase wall (character 1641), a quadrate with ventromedially projected medial hemicondyle (character 1814), and a retroarticular longitudinal crest (character 2031).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This last character is present in all South American gharials preserving this region [9,10], including an unnamed Late Oligocene gharial from Pirabas, Brazil [50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinctive long posterior or posterolateral projections of the squamosal, (i.e., squamosal prongs) no longer diagnose Gryposuchinae as had been hypothesized previously (see Results in [10]), because Argochampsa also clearly possesses this feature [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within gryposuchines, there is low support for a clade comprising Ikanogavialis, Siquisiquesuchus, and Piscogavialis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other gavialoid relationships were unaffected relative to the initial analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discussions below are based on this second phylogenetic analysis, unless otherwise noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Gryposuchus pachakamue inhabited the heart of the proto-Amazonian mega-wetlands ecosystem during the Middle Miocene, from around 16 to 13 Ma, and it represents the oldest known record of a gavialoid from this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remains belonging to this new taxon were consistently recovered from deposits depicting shallow lacustrine paleoenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the basalmost species of the Gryposuchus clade, it provides essential evidence for accurately reconstructing the ancestral anatomy and ecology of this clade and provides evidence of parallel evolution of distinctive rostral and orbital anatomy in gavialoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our phylogenetic analyses reconstruct the acquisition of widely separated orbits as independent evolutionary events in Asian Gavialis and later-diverging Gryposuchus species (Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  colombianus + Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  croizati) in South America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the comparatively slender interorbital bridge of Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pachakamue is primitive for all gavialoids (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A wide interorbital bridge is associated with possessing telescoped orbits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traits associated with fully telescoped orbits, as is observed in Gavialis and advanced Gryposuchus species (but absent in Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pachakamue) include: postorbital bar flush with lateral jugal surface (character 1351), upturned dorsal and posterior orbital margins (character 1372), and ventral orbital margin with a prominent notch (character 1381).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parsimony analyses also suggest parallel development for two of these character states, indicating that the telescoped orbit condition is homoplastic in gavialoids and occurred independently in advanced South American Gryposuchus and Asian Gavialis species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By mapping the phylogenetic tree onto the first two axes of the PCA axes, we examined ecological associations of circumorbital bone arrangements throughout gavialoid evolution (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher PC1 and PC2 scores define a morphospace of gavialoids found in coastal marine deposits, such as Piscogavialis and Argochampsa, whereas lower scores along these PC axes correspond to the morphospace including taxa with fully telescoped orbits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lacustrine Gryposuchus pachakamue and Eogavialis africanus, the latter lacking definitive data on its paleoenvironmental provenance, exemplify the intermediate morphospace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fully telescoped orbit morphospace is represented by Gavialis and Gryposuchus colombianus; since they are distantly related, this morphospace depicts the parallel evolution of this distinctive cranial anatomy, apparently associated with convergent specialization in a freshwater habitat and similar visually enhanced feeding strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinct features of this morphotype include: upturned anterior, dorsal, and posterior orbital margins; ventral orbital margin with a prominent notch; postorbital pillar laterally displaced; and orbits widely separated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gavialoids display different degrees of the telescoped condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The feeding strategy of the extant gharial Gavialis gangeticus involve active use of the telescoped eyes and integumentary sense organs in capturing fishes in streams [51], as its habitat is confined to freshwater settings of the Indian subcontinent, notably restricted to riverine environments [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fossil gharials with well-developed telescoped orbits are usually found in depositional settings documenting fluvial-dominated paleoenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This similar habitat association in the extant and extinct convergent taxa offers further support for the adaptive value of possessing telescoped orbits and suggests that this morphotype in fossil gavialoids typically is correlated with taxa living in riverine ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plio-Pleistocene fossil Gavialis species inhabited, and might have dispersed geographically via, fluvial systems then occurring between Indo-Pakistan and Southeast Asia [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In South America, late Middle Miocene Gryposuchus colombianus is restricted to fluvial-influenced settings of the Pebas Mega-Wetland System at La Venta (Colombia) [8,54] and Fitzcarrald (Peru) [11,55,56], close to the rapidly rising Andes, whereas this species is absent from coeval deposits representing brackish, dysoxic lakes, swamps and deltas of the same biome at Iquitos (Peru) where Gryposuchus pachakamue consistently occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter species not only is the sole gavialoid in the Iquitos fauna, but the sole longirostrine crocodylian within a highly diversified community dominated by small caimans with crushing dentitions reflecting a specialized malacophagous diet [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In younger beds at Iquitos (Molluscan Zone MZ9 or younger), we only recovered a telescoped orbit gavialoid from one locality (IQ125) in the Uppermost Pebas Formation [33], at a time corresponding to development of new regional fluvial-dominated conditions, attributable to a peak in Andean uplift and the onset of the Amazon River System [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within a wider environmental context, the demise of the Pebas Mega-Wetland System and subsequent establishment of the fluvio-tidal Acre Phase in the Amazonian Basin at around 10.5 Ma seems to have promoted diversification, size increase, and specialization in gharials (Fig 9) compared with the presence of only one species per Middle Miocene-aged crocodylian fauna (i.e., Iquitos, La Venta, and Fitzcarrald).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Late Miocene assemblages of Acre (Brazil) contain four gavialoid taxa [57], including the conspicuous record of forms with telescoped orbits (RS-G, pers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  obs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the same number of taxa is observed in the Late Miocene Urumaco Formation of Venezuela, matches between the dominant environment and specific morphotypes is far more complicated to assess there.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Urumaco Formation preserves several aquatic environments that were potential habitats for crocodylians within the Paleo-Orinoco Basin, such as delta plains, swamps, marginal marine embayments, and rivers, all with a marine influence from the Caribbean [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this patchwork of environments, the Urumaco gavialoid species exhibit a highly disparate array of cranial circumorbital configurations [9,34,48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Urumaco a telescoped orbit specialization was fully attained by the giant Gryposuchus croizati, most likely a dweller in fluvial settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on its paleoenvironmental preference in the Iquitos fauna, Gryposuchus cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pachakamue from Urumaco instead might have occupied relicts of the brackish lacustrine ecosystems once widely distributed in proto-Amazonia [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the record of this gavialoid at Urumaco adds evidence for the persistence of Pebasian aquatic conditions during the Late Miocene in northernmost South America, where the lower course of the Pebasian proto-Amazonian System drainage was formerly situated [11,58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Inasmuch as gharials were inhabitants in the Caribbean region at least since the Late Oligocene [39], the Caribbean Portal at the mouth of the proto-Amazonian aquatic system might have played an important role for the invasion of gavialoids into the inland areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Siquisiquesuchus was an early Miocene Caribbean inhabitant of present-day Venezuelan coasts [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other marine and fresh water units in the region document numerous remains of gharials throughout the Miocene [9,34,62,63], showing persistent faunas living close to the Caribbean Portal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either by means of marine transgressions or via riverine drainage systems, a continuous aquatic corridor united the Caribbean Sea with western proto-Amazonia for most of the Paleogene and early Neogene [19,32,61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heart of proto-Amazonia during the extensive and persistent Pebas Mega-Wetland System was continuously connected with the Caribbean Portal by a northward-flowing trunk drainage [32,61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not coeval, evidence of the prevailing aquatic connections that linked both areas through the Llanos (Colombia) until the Late-Middle Miocene boundary is founded on the record of Gryposuchus pachakamue from both Urumaco and Iquitos, as well as other biotic indicators [11,6468].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific environmental conditions fostering high diversity of Late Miocene Urumaco gavialoid diversity remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our phylogenetic analyses propose sister-group relationships of Caribbean Aktiogavialis and African Argochampsa (Fig 7 and Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of our time-calibrated phylogenetic tree, this association would suggest an African origin for the Caribbean gavialoid, probably by western transatlantic dispersal, as suggested by early authors [42,69] and more recently by Vélez-Juarbe et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Argochampsa, Aktiogavialis, and the oldest records of South American gharials all were found in deposits from coastal marine settings [10,39,47,50,70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether fossil gharials were strictly marine or not, distinct lines of evidence indicate that gavialoids flourished during high sea surface levels and temperatures (SST) of the Paleocene and Eocene epochs [59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this time interval (~6045 Ma), paleogeographic reconstructions depict a tropical marine connection from India and Africa to the Caribbean and northern South America through the Tethys Ocean and Caribbean Sea [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the fossil record is far from complete in these areas, our time-calibrated phylogenetic tree and the occurrence of advanced gavialoids along both the Tethys and Caribbean coasts and islands, suggest that this marine realm could have served as a preferred habitat and dispersal system for gavialoids during the Paleogene (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of gharials in South America most likely resulted from a single transoceanic colonization event and subsequent diversification in South America, distinct from the one that gave rise to the Caribbean taxon Aktiogavialis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gavialoid history exhibits independent acquisitions of the telescoped orbits condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of the new Pebasian species Gryposuchus pachakamue and other South American fossil gavialoids document high plasticity in orbital anatomy, which appears to have been strongly correlated with a visually enhanced feeding strategy and environmental circumstances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphospaces occupied by fluvial and coastal marine specialists are identified by quantitative analysis of orbital and circumorbital shape variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of the phylogenetic history, a fluvial habitus in South American gharials is derived from ancestral lacustrine-deltaic forms with incipient development of protruding eyes or telescoped orbits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circumorbital region of coastal marine gavialoids is closer in morphology to that of brevirostrine crocodylians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying morphological steps of parallel evolution and ancestral ecological habitus in gavialoids provides models for reconstructing puzzling phylogenetic histories and adaptive radiations within extinct crocodylomorphs clades with elongated rostrums, such as thalattosuchians, dyrosaurids, and pholidosaurids [71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proto-Amazonian connections with the Caribbean Sea to the north, and the subsequent onset of the transcontinental Amazon River System draining eastward, provided multiple habitats and conditions for gavialoid colonizations of new areas and extensive morphological diversification in South America throughout the mid-late Cenozoic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
