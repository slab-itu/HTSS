Minimally Symptomatic Infection in an Ebola Hotspot: A Cross-Sectional Serosurvey  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evidence for minimally symptomatic Ebola virus (EBOV) infection is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the 201316 outbreak in West Africa, it was not considered epidemiologically relevant to published models or projections of intervention effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of EBOV in humans, we investigated the occurrence of minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in quarantined contacts of reported Ebola virus disease cases in a recognized hotspot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methodology_Principal_Findings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted a cross-sectional serosurvey in Sukudu, Kono District, Sierra Leone, from October 2015 to January 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A blood sample was collected from 187 study participants, 132 negative controls (individuals with a low likelihood of previous exposure to Ebola virus), and 30 positive controls (Ebola virus disease survivors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IgG responses to Ebola glycoprotein and nucleoprotein were measured using Alpha Diagnostic International ELISA kits with plasma diluted at 1:200.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical density was read at 450 nm (subtracting OD at 630nm to normalize well background) on a ChroMate 4300 microplate reader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cutoff of 4.7 U/mL for the anti-GP ELISA yielded 96.7% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity in distinguishing positive and negative controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 14 seropositive individuals not known to have had Ebola virus disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two of the 14 seropositive individuals reported only fever during quarantine while the remaining 12 denied any signs or symptoms during quarantine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions_Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By using ELISA to measure Zaire Ebola virus antibody concentrations, we identified a significant number of individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection in a hotspot village in Sierra Leone, approximately one year after the village outbreak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data also suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the outbreak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are needed to understand the potential risk of transmission and clinical sequelae in individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With over 28,000 reported cases, the 201316 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic is the largest and longest on record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides further evidence that Ebola, like other viruses, causes a spectrum of clinical manifestations that may include minimally symptomatic infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings also suggest that many episodes of human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus in West Africa may have gone undetected in the recent outbreak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has implications for the definition of Ebola virus disease survivorship, delineation of transmission chains, and future vaccine studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite over 28,000 reported cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the 201316 pandemic as of March 27, 2016 [1], we are only beginning to trace the complex biosocial processes that have promoted spread of the virus [2,3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Important questions remain, including how to best use tools such as new vaccines [4] and rapid diagnostic tests [5] to contain future outbreaks, the extent to which symptomatic individuals do not present for care, how to identify and manage clinical sequelae of EVD [6], and the incidence and transmission dynamics of minimally symptomatic Ebola virus (EBOV) infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evidence for minimally symptomatic EBOV infection is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the 201316 outbreak in West Africa, it was not considered epidemiologically relevant to published models or projections of intervention effects [710].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it is not known if clinical sequelae seen in survivors of EVD (e.g., uveitis) exist in individuals who had minimally symptomatic EBOV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of EBOV in humans, we investigated the occurrence of minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in a recognized Ebola hotspot [11], which we defined as an area with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed EVD attack rate above 2% in a two-month period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods_and_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure the occurrence of EBOV infection in a group of people exposed to confirmed cases, we validated a commercial ELISA kit in a cohort of patients with known Ebola status and then used this tool to determine infection status in previously quarantined individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ethics_Statement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study protocol was approved by the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee and the Stanford University Institutional Review Board (Protocol ID: 33882).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We held meetings with Paramount, Sectional, and Town Chiefs to discuss the proposal and supply them with written information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then held town meetings to describe the project and answer community questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals provided written informed consent or placed a thumbprint after hearing a consent script read in the Krio or Kono languages (both ethics committees approved the use of an oral script and thumbprint for those participants who could not read or write); parents signed for children under the age of 18, and children and adolescents provided verbal assent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects received 50,000 Leones (~$10 US) for their participation in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Setting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kono is a diamond-rich district in eastern Sierra Leone which reported 301 cases of EVD (that is, RT-PCR confirmed individuals who presented for isolation or were identified by surveillance teams) between August 2014 and February 2015 (Kono District Ebola Response Centre (DERC), personal communication).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of the authors worked closely with the Kono DERC, British military, and International Federation of the Red Cross on containment, isolation, and surveillance during the time of active transmission in the district.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parts I and II of this study were conducted from October 2015 to January 2016 by a team consisting of two physicians, a physician-anthropologist, a laboratory technician, and two community health workers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One year after the peak of the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, we identified positive IgG responses to Zaire-EBOV in 14 individuals not known to have had EBOV infection from a village classified as a hotspot for Ebola transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, the majority reported having had no symptoms consistent with EVD during the epidemic while two reported only fever.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our data suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the epidemic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although it was difficult to verify symptoms through our retrospective interviews (given the considerable denial of EVD during the outbreak due to stigma and the fear of being admitted to an ETU where those admitted were seldom discharged), our data indicate that 25% of EBOV infections may have been minimally symptomatic, which is similar to the data from empiric studies and to recent modeled estimates [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phenomenon of previously undetected, minimally symptomatic EBOV infection was evident around the discovery of the virus in 1976.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an immunofluorescence assay, the World Health Organization/International Study Team found that 19% of contacts of EVD casesvery few of whom gave any history of illnesshad antibodies to the virus [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2000, Leroy and colleagues published a study (based on ELISA/Western blot) and found that of 24 asymptomatic close contacts of Gabonese patients with EVD, 11 developed both IgM and IgG responses to Ebola Zaire antigens, indicating viral infection [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other investigators have found evidence of seropositive individuals in areas without large outbreaks using ELISA and postulate that there may have been active circulation of filovirus without apparent clinical manifestations [17,18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heffernan and colleagues also used ELISA in Gabon and found that 1% of individuals in an epidemic zone had IgG antibodies to Ebola Zaire virus, yet no history of exposure [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another study in Gabon, Becquart and colleagues found a 15.3% Ebola Zaire IgG seroprevalence in 220 randomly selected villages and concluded that most of the seropositive persons identified probably had mild or asymptomatic infection [20]; however, they used uninfected individuals in France as negative controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that unexposed expatriates (not included as negative controls) had a significantly lower mean log anti-GP (M = 5.25 U/mL, SD = 0.54, N = 12) than unexposed Sierra Leoneans (M = 6.40 U/mL, SD = 1.06, N = 132) using the two-sample t-test for unequal variances, t(20.05) = 6.40, Pless_than = 0.001 (see Fig 3), potentially due to cross-reactivity of our assay with closely related pathogens circulating in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study has several possible limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, if asymptomatic EBOV infection is a common occurrence, it is possible that some of the true negatives used for the validation of our ELISA assays could have been infected with EBOV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not use a microneutralization assay for comparison purposes, nor did our pool of EVD survivors represent all of the possible antibody titers in the regional population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the serologic assay conferred sensitivity and specificity greater than 95%, the assay protocol produced antibody titers that were considered qualitative in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we relied on study participants and their household contacts memories of events that had taken place up to a year prior when we classified them as symptomatic or asymptomatic (potential recall bias); however, during the outbreak, most quarantined households were monitored daily by surveillance teams that conducted symptom screens and measured temperatures, and individuals were brought to treatment facilities for EBOV testing if they screened positive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, our IgG assays indicate previous infection but provide no information on when that infection took place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3 negative controls with positive tests either represent false positives due to cross-reactive antibodies or previously infected individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (We did not perform IgM ELISAs, as other investigators have demonstrated that Ebola IgM titers largely diminish within 60 to 90 days of symptom onset [21,22].)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, we did not ascertain whether there were non-quarantined individuals who had minimally symptomatic infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study focused on the quarantined population of one village.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrapolation of our findings to other villages and generalizability to the epidemic should be approached with caution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although many of the study participants were followed by surveillance teams during the time of active EBOV transmission in their village, the timing of the possible infection cannot be known from IgG data, and it is improbable that surveillance teams followed each individual throughout the duration of the outbreak in Sierra Leone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the concern that IgG positive persons indeed had but denied symptoms cannot be excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite these limitations, our serosurvey provides a deeper perspective on EBOV transmission, and more village-level serosurveys could enhance our understanding of undetected EBOV transmission at the epidemic level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our findings suggest there would be value in exploring the interaction of seropositive persons and EVD cases to improve our understanding of exposure risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, we may learn more about how efforts at containment can be improved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data also have important implications for future vaccine studies that rely on detecting antibody to EBOV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, the findings support the World Health Organizations interim guidance on clinical care for survivors of EVD, which defines a survivor as a person:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is ongoing discussion in West Africa over the definition of survivorship, usually specified by having a positive EBOV RT-PCR result and discharge from an ETU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plans are underway to develop national registries and provide ID cards to such survivors, so as to delineate individuals eligible for free social and medical support services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Should the notion of survivorship be extended to all those who are IgG positive, including those who had minimally symptomatic infection or who were sick but were never tested at the time of illness?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How we define a community of suffering is always problematic and should be revisited given that this definition has implications for identity, stigma, and access to social and medical services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, by using ELISA to measure Zaire-EBOV antibody concentrations, we identified a significant number of individuals with previously undetected minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in a hotspot village in Sierra Leone, approximately one year after the village outbreak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are needed to understand the potential risk of transmission and clinical sequelae in individuals with minimally symptomatic EBOV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
