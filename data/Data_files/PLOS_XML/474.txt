Death and the Oldest Old: Attitudes and Preferences for End-of-Life Care - Qualitative Research within a Population-Based Cohort Study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increasing longevity means more people will be dying in very old age, but little is known about the preferences of the oldest old regarding their care at the end of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aims  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand very old peoples preferences regarding care towards the end of life and attitudes towards dying, to inform policy and practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Qualitative data collection for n = 42 population-based cohort study participants aged 95101 (88% women, 42% in long-term-care): topic-guided interviews with n = 33 participants and n = 39 proxy informants, most with both (n = 30: 4 jointly + separate interviews for 26 dyads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Death was a part of life: these very old people mainly live day-to-day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most were ready to die, reflecting their concerns regarding quality of life, being a nuisance, having nothing to live for and having lived long enough.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrasting views were rare exceptions but voiced firmly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most were not worried about death itself, but concerned more about the dying process and impacts on those left behind; a peaceful and pain-free death was a common ideal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attitudes ranged from not wanting to think about death, through accepting its inevitable approach to longing for its release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preferring to be made comfortable rather than have life-saving treatment if seriously ill, and wishing to avoid hospital, were commonly expressed views.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was little or no future planning, some consciously choosing not to.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncertainty hampered end-of-life planning even when death was expected soon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some stressed circumstances, such as severe dependency and others likely decision-making roles, would influence choices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carers found these issues harder to raise but felt they would know their older relatives preferences, usually palliative care, although we found two discrepant views.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This studys rare data show 95-year-olds are willing to discuss dying and end-of-life care but seldom do.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formal documentation of wishes is extremely rare and may not be welcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although being ready to die and preferring a palliative approach predominated, these preferences cannot be assumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Living longer means dying older.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Demographic changes mean more people are living their last years in very old age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1] How does this affect their attitudes towards death, dying and care towards the end of life?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiences and preferences of older old people, or their carers, are rarely heard, but their voices are crucial to shaping end-of-life care services to reflect the priorities of increasingly older people approaching death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The existing literature on end of life preferences and experiences of older people is limited, and particularly so in relation to very old people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2;3] Research to date has typically sought bereaved relatives views,[48] though some pioneering studies with older people have been largely in long-term care settings,[913] occasionally with just community-dwelling older people,[1418] but to our knowledge none so very old and none except our cohort[19] taking a population-based approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study informs policy, planning and practice by exploring thoughts on death and dying and preferences for end-of-life care with a representative sample of very old peopleover-95-year-olds, their relatives and formal carers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A qualitative interview was added to the regular quantitative survey data collection at the 7th wave follow-up (Year 21) of a longitudinal study of ageing, the Cambridge City over-75s Cohort (CC75C) study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full study methods have are described elsewhere[20] (http://www.cc75c.group.cam.ac.uk/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original population-based sample (n = 2166, 95% response rate) enrolled in 1985/87 using general practice lists have been re-interviewed every few years following Cambridge Research Ethics Committee approval and renewed consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid under-representation of the most frail, proxy informants were also interviewed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interviews were conducted face-to-face in the interviewees usual home or occasionally, with proxies, by phone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mortality was the main source of attrition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this Survey 7, following completion of the CC75C interviewer-administered structured questionnaire (http://www.cc75c.group.cam.ac.uk/pages/questionnaires), participants were invited to a further interview more like a conversation than the usual survey with the aim of understanding what it is like to be so old, your experiences of care and your views on some of these issues that are more complex than a survey can explore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A topic guide of open-ended questions (http://www.cc75c.group.cam.ac.uk/pages/additionaldata) explored issues participants had raised in past surveys, where quantitative methods had been inadequate to fully explore the depth of responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When proxy informants were interviewed, they were asked what they believed would be the response from the older person as well as their own views and experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple strategies maximised inclusion of these very old and often frail participants in qualitative data collection [see Box 1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To maximise the value of these data sources, the entirety of this relatively large qualitative archive was included in the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A descriptive thematic analysis was conducted using a framework approach,[21] which facilitates working with large data sets, particularly where data collection is more structured, and where co-researchers share analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NVivo software (http://www.qsrinternational.com/products_nvivo.aspx) was used to manage and index the data prior to charting, mapping and interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis team, trained in framework analysis, consisted of two to three analysts at any one time (four individuals trained in qualitative methods) working independently, in parallel and together at various steps of the analytic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of 54 study participants alive when Survey 7 started, 6 died before they could be interviewed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 48 remaining, 44 (92%) took part in the usual survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitative data were collected for all but two people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the majority (n = 30, 71%) both the participant and a proxy informant were interviewed, usually separately (n = 26) or for a few jointly (n = 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a small minority (n = 3, 7%) only the participant was interviewed and for one in five (n = 9, 21%) only proxy interviews were possible [see Fig 1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All but six proxy informants were relatives, most commonly daughters (n = 20) or sons (n = 7); non-family included care-home staff, a live-in care-assistant and a friend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were aged 95101, mainly women (n = 37, 88%); 57% were community-dwelling (n = 20 in private dwellings, half of these living alone, n = 4 alone in sheltered accommodation) [see Table 1 for further demographics].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full archive for qualitative analysis comprised 112 source documents (1269 pages) including anonymised transcripts from 95.5 hours of audio-recordings from 91 interviews relating to 42 older people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CC75C studys population-based sample continued to be representative even in its Year 21 follow-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of n = 48 still alive 92% (n = 44) were included in this survey wave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitative data collection for 95% (42/44) of these included recorded interviews with 79% (33/42) of these 95- to 101-year-old participants in person.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Analyses yielded three main topics: 1) the context, beliefs and outlooks framing the lives of our very old study participants; 2) their attitudes towards dying and death; 3) their preferences concerning end-of-life care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings are presented below in sub-themes of each topic with sample comments (all names and identifying details have been changed) [see Box 2 for thematic overview].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
1)_Context__beliefs_&_outlooks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants vividly described the context in which they were living their later years, a context where contemporaries deaths heightened awareness of dying, though interviews revealed considerable variation in views on readiness to die or not, medicalisation of dying, euthanasia and life outlook.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

2)_Attitudes_towards_dying_and_death  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thinking about death, talking about death and what might follow death emerged as separate themes in the interviews.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

3)_Preferences_concerning_end-of-life_care  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By and large, interviewees talked readily about end-of-life care preferences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion__Implications_and_Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We sought thoughts on death and dying and preferences for end-of-life care with a representative sample of very old people, their relatives and formal carers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rare dataset of qualitative interviews described 95-year-olds lives as contextualised by death, with the majority wondering why they were still there and a minority celebrating their survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Death was now a part of life for these very old people who were mainly living day-to-day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most were ready to die, reflecting their concerns for quality of life, not being a nuisance, having nothing to live for and feelings of having lived long enough.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrasting views were rare exceptions but voiced firmly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unwanted medical prolongation of life was an issue for some and mention of euthanasia related to loss of quality of life, usually raised by proxy informants for whom legal implications were a concern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most were not worried about death itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concerns, coloured by experience of others dying, were more about impact on those left behind and the dying process; a peaceful and pain-free death, preferably during sleep, was a common ideal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wide variation in attitudes ranged from not wanting to think about death, through accepting it as inevitable and approaching, to welcoming or even longing for its release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preferring to be made comfortable rather than have life-saving treatment if seriously ill, and wishing to avoid going into hospital, were both commonly expressed views, again with a few firm exceptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some stressed choices would be affected by circumstances, such as likelihood of severe dependency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They fatalistically accepted decisions might well be taken by others, family and healthcare professionals, and trust in decision-makers was important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some felt their destiny lay with God or fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncertainty hampered end-of-life planning even when death was expected soon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was little or no planning for the future, some consciously choosing not to.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Written documentation of wishes was virtually unheard of, except sometimes for funerals or wills; the only mention of living wills was in relation to a reluctance to prepare one, and the only example we came across of an advance care plan, in nursing home notes, had been ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite a notable willingness to discuss end-of-life preferences in most interviews, and death being so ubiquitous, previously having talked openly about death was uncommon, often only alluded to or couched in humour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not all the older people wanted to have such discussions; for the minority who had, these explicit discussions had usually been with care professionals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Families and care professionals found these issues hard to raise, generally saying preferences had never been discussed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They felt they knew their older relatives well enough to predict their preferences, usually palliative care, mirroring what most older participants wanted, although we found two discrepant views.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rarely are the views of the very old heard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our sizeable qualitative dataset uniquely evidences the perspectives of a representative sample of over-95-year-olds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to much qualitative research that aims to capture diversity through purposive sampling, these were population-based cohort participants and moreover were well-characterised by the mixed methods CC75C studys quantitative epidemiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a single-centre study, sample characteristics are in line with national data available for this age-group and other developed countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-response potentially limits research validity, but 79% of the surviving cohort were interviewed in person and proxy interviews maximised participation to 92%, ensuring people across the cognitive and health spectrum were included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proxy informants frequently quoted participants themselves, but there are inevitable uncertainties regarding the validity of perspectives heard second-hand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reliance on informants to represent older relatives preferences, as we found most could, is not only a research issue; the occasional discrepant views we found have implications for practice, highlighted in other studies too.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2224] However, including these reported views, despite the limitations of proxy reporting, ensured we captured some of the voices of those least able to express themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further limitation was the studys inability to explore how very old peoples views might change over time, particularly as they neared death, a question of importance given their unpredictable circumstances that merits further research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study adds to the few studies to date that have sought the views of older people themselves,[919;24] rather than just through relatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [48] Although previous research generally interviewed younger old people, we found overlapping themes, also highlighted in the few relevant reviews.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2;3;10] Heterogeneity of views is unsurprising,[2;3;25;26] but some common themes are striking: even in their late 90s or beyond our participants generally conveyed a living for today approach previously reported[2;1214;27] and comfortable acceptance of death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2;3;26] Others too have found a readiness to talk about dying and end-of-life care,[2;3;11;16] though this rarely happened,[2;12] and willingness to make plans was less clear-cut[3;16;28]: one UK study found people living alone in their 80s wanting to prepare for and to have a choice with regard to where and when they might die,[15] but a US study found housebound older people were reluctant to plan for serious illness or dying, especially resisting decision-making on hypothetical future dilemmas, preferring to wait till they cross that bridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [14] Other studies of people with dementia and their family carers have also reported the perceived difficulty of making formal plans for unknown futures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [24;27] Other researchers found, as we did, a minority who preferred not to discuss dying at all[3;14] and an expectation by some that others might make decisions when necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3;11;12] As in our study, generally people were more likely to plan for deathfunerals or willsthan dying,[2;11;14] although only a minority worried about death itself, most were more likely worried about the manner of dying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [15;19]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study found that an over-whelming majority of our very old sample had strong preferences for palliative carebeing made comfortableversus life-saving treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others have also reported a majority preferring not to have interventions[11] and found preferences for life-sustaining treatment declined with decreasing physical or psychological functioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [29] Some questioned the value of intervention: Why are we being kept alive?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [18] Although only a minority wanted life-saving treatment, these were strong preferences but had not been communicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although current policy encourages early discussion and documentation of end-of-life care preferences,[3032] our study and others illustrate how multiple barriers to advance care planning[3;8;24;33;34] apply also to other relevant options rarely discussed, such as moving into long-term care,[35] not least how unpredictability and changing contexts may change choices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [9;11;14;23;29;3640] Others have given thoughtful consideration to the need to recognise that more dying people are following longer frailty trajectories and the implications for care services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6;16;26;41;42] Previous research has highlighted challenges of improving communication about preferences[7;25;26;34;40;41;4346]; we noted with interest other researchers comments that participants welcomed interviews as an opportunity to express thoughts,[11] as did many of ours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found questions on specific topics could open up dialogue with people hesitant to discuss dying in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interviewees themselves suggested that being surrounded by death provided opportunities to start conversations, and both family and professional carers admitted being hesitant to broach the matter, at times leaving an older person with concerns and information needs, for instance pain relief, that no-one addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We and others have described the complex transitions often experienced by very old people approaching the end of life,[38;4752] and there is widespread recognition that transfers between care settings may be detrimental.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [42;5355] Most of our participants viewed the prospect of hospital negatively, but supporting older people to achieve current preferences in changing circumstances is a major challenge for research and practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prognostication uncertainties in frailty trajectories make determining when hospital admission is inappropriate challenging, and too much admissions avoidance risks denying very old people diagnosis, treatment and care that may be entirely appropriate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [38;42;56] Half of UK deaths aged 85 are in hospitals and a third in care homes[53] so improving end-of-life care for very old people in all settings is a priority.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7;30;41;42;54;5760] Prospective population-based research with older old people, and their informal and formal carers, examining determinants of staying-in-place or transitions is needed to understand what would enable older people to die in the place and with the support they would choose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
