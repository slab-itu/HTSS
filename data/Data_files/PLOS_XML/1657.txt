Happy creativity: Listening to happy music facilitates divergent thinking  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Creativity can be considered one of the key competencies for the twenty-first century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It provides us with the capacity to deal with the opportunities and challenges that are part of our complex and fast-changing world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question as to what facilitates creative cognitionthe ability to come up with creative ideas, problem solutions and productsis as old as the human sciences, and various means to enhance creative cognition have been studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite earlier scientific studies demonstrating a beneficial effect of music on cognition, the effect of music listening on creative cognition has remained largely unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current study experimentally tests whether listening to specific types of music (four classical music excerpts systematically varying on valance and arousal), as compared to a silence control condition, facilitates divergent and convergent creativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Creativity was higher for participants who listened to happy music (i.e., classical music high on arousal and positive mood) while performing the divergent creativity task, than for participants who performed the task in silence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No effect of music was found for convergent creativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the scientific contribution, the current findings may have important practical implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Music listening can be easily integrated into daily life and may provide an innovative means to facilitate creative cognition in an efficient way in various scientific, educational and organizational settings when creative thinking is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overview  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Creativity is the driving force behind scientific, technological and cultural innovation, and it can be considered one of the key competences for the 21st century [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The problems we face in our complex and fast-changing world more than ever demand creative thinking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we are in a creativity crisis, people in general are thinking less creatively than before [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question as to what facilitates creative cognitionthe ability to come up with creative ideas, problem solutions and productsis as old as the human sciences [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas in the Middle Ages creativity was reserved for those with divine inspiration, in the renaissance some humans, the genius minds, were finally thought capable of creative thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern research has shown that creative thinking is inherent to normative cognitive functioning, rather than an innate talent available to only a few genius minds, and depends on fundamental cognitive processes [79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, it has been demonstrated that creative cognition can be facilitated [1011], and in the past decades various means to enhance creativity have been developed and tested (e.g., brainstorming, making random connections; for reviews, see [1213]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of music listening on creative cognition, however, has remained largely unexploreddespite earlier scientific studies demonstrating a beneficial effect of music on cognition [14] and an increased scientific interest in the influence of musical experience on cognitive functions unrelated to music abilities [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current project aims to shed light on the potential association of music listening for optimizing creative cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This project is unique as, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first to experimentally test whether listening to specific types of music (classical music excerpts varying on mood and arousal), as compared to a silence control condition, facilitates creative cognition, as measured by divergent and convergent creativity tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Music listening can be easily integrated into daily life and may provide an innovative means to facilitate creative cognition in an inexpensive and efficient way in various scientific, educational and organizational settings when creative thinking is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the remaining part of the introduction we will put the study into context by providing theoretical background related to creativity, the effects of music listening on cognition, and on mood and creativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Creativity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Creativity is usually defined as the generation of ideas, insights, or problem solutions that are original (i.e., new) and meant to be useful [1618].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Creativity entails both divergent thinking and convergent thinking [1921].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Divergent thinking involves producing multiple answers from available information by making unexpected combinations, recognizing links among remote associates, or transforming information into unexpected forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical example of divergent thinking is idea generation, as measured in the Alternative Uses Task [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although important, divergent thinking is only one component of creative cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many scholars emphasize the need for an additional ability, convergent thinking; that is, the cognitive process of deriving the single best, or most correct, answer to a problem or question [2224].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Convergent thinking emphasizes accuracy and logic, and applies conventional search, recognition, and decision-making strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, convergent thinking can easily be considered to be uncreative, but it may actually still require creativity as it is, for example, required in tasks where seemingly unrelated concepts have to be related, as measured in the Remote Associates Task [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we investigate the role of music listening on the entire range of creative cognition, that is, on divergent and convergent thinking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effects_of_music_listening_on_cognition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Scientific interest in the potential benefits of music on cognition was sparked by the publication of an article that reported superior spatial abilities for participants who listened to music composed by Mozart compared to those who sat in silence [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is assumed that these finding, known as the Mozart effect, can be explained by the perceivers arousal level and mood [27], which can affect performance on a variety of cognitive tasks [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although extensive research has examined the impact of music on cognition, to the best of our knowledge there are only a very limited number of studies that have directly addressed the effects of music on creative cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adaman and Blaney [2] published a study that used music to induce either a depressed, elated or neutral mood, followed by the subject completing a divergent creativity task (generating alternative uses for a household item).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They found a significant effect for an increase in fluency (i.e., the number of uses generated) for both depressed and elated when compared with neutral mood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the originality of the generated uses, there was significant elevation in score for the depressed mood, but not elated, while for flexibility no effect was found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, however, the stimulus used was a set of 20 minute musical tapes which had been created by Pignatiello, Camp and Rasar [29], which were validated by observing heart rate and diastolic condition, and by measuring inter-rater reliability as to mood induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precisely what type of music was presented is not clear in this paper, and we will return to this issue later in the paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the study did not include a silence control condition, and measured only one aspect of creativity, divergent thinking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ilie and Thompson [30] investigated participants performance on a creative insight task after exposure to music that varied in pitch height (high or low), rate (fast or slow), and intensity (loud or soft).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants who listened to high-pitch music were more successful at solving the insight task than participants who listened to low-pitch music, and mediation analysis revealed that the effect of pitch height on insight task performance was fully mediated by the emotional valence participants associated with the music.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Yamada and Nagai [31] conducted an experiment that compared participants who performed a creativity task while listening to happy music against a group who listened to a reading of the Japanese constitution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were asked to generate new names for rice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five examples of non-existent names, all ending with the word hikari, were provided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Names generated that ended with hikari were treated as conventional or typical ideas, reflecting fixed and constrained thought processes (i.e., convergent thinking), whereas names not ending with hikari were treated as unconventional or atypical ideas, reflecting free and unconstrained thought processes (i.e., divergent thinking).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantity of convergent ideas was not affected by the sound being played to the participants prior to the creativity task, whereas the quantity of divergent ideas was larger for the group that listened to the happy music prior to the creativity task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors interpreted this to mean that being in a positive mood facilitates flexible thinking and consequently leads to the production of unconventional or atypical ideas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mood_and_creative_thinking  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extensive research has explored how mood states affect creative thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, a positive mood appears to be associated to improvements in divergent thinking, but not convergent thinking (although this is not as clear) [3233].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  De Rooij and Jones [34] argued that the appraisal tendency perspective on moods (as opposed to the simple positive/negative perspective) gives a better explanation of the effect of mood on creativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, research from De Dreu, Baas, and Nijstad [35] suggests that the arousal level (activating vs. deactivating) should be considered in the mood creativity link, as activating moods influence creative fluency and originality because of enhanced cognitive flexibility when mood is positive and because of enhanced persistence when mood is negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aims  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the current study, we aim to extend the sparse literature on the potential association of music listening for optimizing creative cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This project is unique, as it is the first to experimentally test whether listening to specific types of music, as compared to a silence control condition, facilitates creative cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we structurally manipulate valence and arousal of the music, and we expose participants to the music excerpt while performing the creativity task and not before performing the creativity task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, creativity is measured by both divergent and convergent creativity tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on previous research, we hypothesize that positive and activating (i.e., happy) music facilitates divergent thinking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to scarce and inconsistent research findings, no specific hypotheses were formulated for the effect of calm, sad and anxious music on divergent thinking, as well as for the effect of music on convergent thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Method  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A total of 155 participants (121 female; Mage = 22.30, SDage = 5.24) gave written informed consent to participate in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declarations of Helsinki and according to the principles of the institutional review board (Ethics Committee Faculty of Social Sciences, Radboud University, the Netherlands; ethical approval was not required as the research was not of a medical nature and there were no potential risks to the participants).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were recruited via the online research participation system (Sona) of Radboud University Nijmegen and gained either course credit of 0.5 hours or 5  (in Iris cheques) for their participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A 2 x 5 mixed measures design was utilised with creative performance (divergent thinking, convergent thinking) as the within subjects variable and music condition (happy, sad, calm, anxious, silence) as the between-subjects variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

General_procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consenting participants were randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions (calm, happy, sad, anxious; for more information, see Table 1) or a silence (control) condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, participants were informed that they will perform four different tasks and several questionnaires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between each task, there was a 20 seconds break, and a countdown timer was displayed to prepare participants for the following section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants in the music conditions were, moreover, told that they are exposed to music right before and during the completion of each of these tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the music conditions, exposure to the music occurred for 15 seconds prior to the task appearing, in order for participants to get into the music.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During these 15 s the screen was blank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the music had played for 15 seconds, the task replaced the blank screen and the music continued playing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The music was played through Sony MDR7505 headphones at a Windows-PC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume was set at a comfortable level, numerically standardised across each computer, and then maintained for the duration of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, participants completed the mood questionnaire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, creative task performance was measured using the Alternative Uses Task, the Idea Selection Task, the Remote Associates Task, and Creative Insight Tasks, in that order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each task was set to a total of 3 minutes, such that participants could spend up to three minutes on each task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If they completed the idea selection, RAT, or Creative Insight tasks in less than three minutes, they could proceed to the next section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After completing the four creativity tasks, participants completed the music and demographics questionnaires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At their completion of the study, participants were debriefed and awarded course credit or payment for their participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants completed the study individually in cubicles, and the lights were slightly dimmed so that the level of brightness was equal across the cubicles used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the completion of the study, the experimenter was sitting in a room outside of the cubicle, and participants could ask the experimenter for help if any instructions were unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study has investigated creativity in the context of music listening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an experimental design, we tested whether listening to specific types of music (four types of music that varied on valence and arousal), as compared to a silence control condition, is beneficial for creativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main conclusion of the results we obtained is that listening to happy music (i.e., classical music that elicits positive mood and is high on arousal), as compared to a silence control condition, is associated with an increase in divergent thinking, but not convergent creativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Why does listening to happy music enhance divergent creativity?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dual pathway to creativity model [52] argues that creative ideation is a function of persistence and flexibility, and that situational variables can influence creativity either through their effects on persistence, on flexibility, or on both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, one can rely on effortful in-depth exploration of a few possibilities and perspectives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when getting stuck in a rut, it can be helpful to, instead of digging deeper, dig elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hereby, as illustrated in the following problem, a flexible thinking style can be beneficial: In developing countries neonatal death rates are high due to unavailable resources to repair high-tech incubators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solutions found by digging deeper could be to further develop the technology so that incubators do not break down, or to train locals to repair these high-tech devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A creative solution generated by thinking flexibly and by digging elsewhere is to design an incubator from car parts, as developing countries have mechanics who possess knowledge about car equipment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A flexible thinking style is not limited to one particular creative field [25], but is equally valid for artistic, verbal and scientific creativity, and may have helped participants in the current study to come up with more creative ideas on the divergent thinking task used in the current study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, as opposed to divergent thinking, listening to happy music did not lead to higher performance on the convergent creativity tasksdespites earlier findings showing that convergent thinking can be facilitated [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in divergent but not convergent thinking after listening to happy music may be explained by the fact that the convergent tasks rely less on fluency and flexibility, but on finding one correct answer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current study provides support to the creative cognition model of creativity (for example [9]), which states that individual differences in creativity can be explained by variations in the efficiency of cognitive processes underlying creativity, and to the idea that creative thinking can be enhanced [10, 12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Limitations_of_the_current_study_and_suggestions_for_future_research  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As mentioned earlier, we assume that the performance difference on the divergent and convergent creativity tasks in the happy music condition can be ascribed to difference in task demands of divergent (generating as many ideas as possible) and convergent (finding one correct answer) creativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that when performing the convergent creativity tasks, participants were exposed to the happy music for the second time, we cannot rule out habituation as an alternative explanation for the performance difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we compared the effect of four different types of music (high vs. low arousal, and positive vs. negative mood) on creative performance in a between-subject design, that is, participants were either assigned to one of the four music conditions or to the silence control condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that we already employed 5 conditions, divergent and convergent creativity was used as a within-subject task, that is, each participant first performed the divergent creativity task while listening to the specific music excerpt (or, in the control condition, performed the task in silence) and, thereafter, performed the convergent creativity tasks while listening to the same music excerpt (or, in the control condition, performed the task in silence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the convergent tasks can be frustrating if the tasks are not solved, and hereby influence subsequent task performance, the convergent tasks were always performed after the divergent task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research could employ only one type of music, happy music, and could include creativity task (divergent vs. convergent) as a between-subject factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, as we assume, task demands and not habituation account for the difference in findings between the divergent and convergent tasks, a beneficial effect of music listening should be observed for the divergent but not for the convergent creativity task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As many people benefit from creative thinking, and we wish these results to have an as wide applicability as possible, our participants were primarily college age adults and not people already involved in creative work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the participant sample had a high education level and a relatively high proportion of females and westerners, which could limit the ecological validity of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings of a meta-analysis [12] suggest that creativity enhancement may be more effective in organizational than academic settings and may have greater effects on men than on women.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that this study relied on a population and setting for which the a priori chance of finding a stimulation effect was not high, the ecological validity and generalizability of the current findings may be enhanced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it is still unknown what impact such training would have on eastern participants and on other age groups, for example, school-aged children and elderly people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research could examine the effect of music listening in eastern cultures and for other age groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, follow-up research could study the moderating role of educational background, such as music experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that even for those not genuinely interested in music an effect of music listening was found on creative thinking, we expect this effect to be even stronger for musicians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the current study provides evidence that listening to happy music enhances creativity on a divergent thinking task, some additional questions related to the music played could be addressed in follow-up research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the music stimuli used in this experimental procedure were chosen for their effectiveness in producing the four emotions nominated [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In future research, rather than being inferred from the music condition presented, mood and arousal could be measured using extensive self-report or other relevant measurement methods (e.g., observing heart rate and diastolic condition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would be likely to provide higher accuracy and may show stronger results between music type and the creativity results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, future research could investigate two parameters that may be relevant for the link between music listening and enhanced creative performance, that is, liking of the music and familiarity with the music.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas in the current study there was no difference between the four music conditions on liking of the music and on familiarity with the music, future research could manipulate these effects by asking people to select their most favourite music excerpt, or by selecting a music excerpt they are not familiar with.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, future research could explore the effect of different music genres (e.g., the effect of non-classical music that is high on positive mood and arousal, such as dance or trance), or one could extend the study by testing the effects of different sounds (e.g., ambient wind chimes, grinding machinery) on creative performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, future research could explore whether it is necessary to listen to music while performing the creativity task, or whether music listening prior to the creativity task is sufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With regard to the creativity measures, in the current study creative performance was measured by well-validated and frequently used divergent and convergent thinking tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In follow-up studies it could also be interesting to assess creativity in terms of real world creative achievement, and to investigate whether music listening is particularly effective for specific creativity domains, for example, artistic creativity or scientific creativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the current study does not allow any conclusions to be made about the long-term effects of music listening on creativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In future research, a follow-up measure could be included to gain information about the duration of the effect, or whether a maintained effect can be developed by frequent music listening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Creativity is one of the most important cognitive skills in our complex, fast-changing world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the past decades, various techniques to enhance creative thinking have been developed and tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, many of the currently available creativity enhancement techniques have to be trained and explicitly communicated, which can be time and cost intensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Employing music listening as a means to stimulate creativity has yet, remained relatively unexploreddespites earlier scientific studies demonstrating a beneficial effect of music on human cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current project aimed to shed light on the potential association of music listening for optimizing divergent and convergent creativity, and demonstrated that listening to happy music (i.e., classical music that elicits positive mood and is high on arousal) is associated with an increase in divergent thinking, but not convergent thinking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the scientific contribution, the current study may provide important practical implicationsmusic listening may be useful to promote creative thinking in inexpensive and efficient ways in various scientific, educational and organizational settings when creative thinking is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
