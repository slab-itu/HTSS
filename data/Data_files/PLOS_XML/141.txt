A New Brachylophosaurin Hadrosaur (Dinosauria: Ornithischia) with an Intermediate Nasal Crest from the Campanian Judith River Formation of Northcentral Montana  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Background  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brachylophosaurini is a clade of hadrosaurine dinosaurs currently known from the Campanian (Late Cretaceous) of North America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its members include: Acristavus gagslarsoni, which lacks a nasal crest; Brachylophosaurus canadensis, which possesses a flat paddle-shaped nasal crest projecting posteriorly over the dorsal skull roof; and Maiasaura peeblesorum, which possesses a dorsally-projecting nasofrontal crest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acristavus, from the lower Two Medicine Formation of Montana (~8180 Ma), is hypothesized to be the ancestral member of the clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brachylophosaurus specimens are from the middle Oldman Formation of Alberta and equivalent beds in the Judith River Formation of Montana; the upper Oldman Formation is dated 77.8 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methodology_Principal_Findings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A new brachylophosaurin hadrosaur, Probrachylophosaurus bergei (gen. et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.) is described and phylogenetically analyzed based on the skull and postcranium of a large individual from the Judith River Formation of northcentral Montana (79.879.5 Ma); the horizon is equivalent to the lower Oldman Formation of Alberta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cranial morphology of Probrachylophosaurus, most notably the nasal crest, is intermediate between Acristavus and Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Brachylophosaurus, the nasal crest lengthens and flattens ontogenetically, covering the supratemporal fenestrae in large adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smaller nasal crest of Probrachylophosaurus is strongly triangular in cross section and only minimally overhangs the supratemporal fenestrae, similar to an ontogenetically earlier stage of Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sutural fusion and tibial osteohistology reveal that the holotype of Probrachylophosaurus was relatively more mature than a similarly large Brachylophosaurus specimen; thus, Probrachylophosaurus is not simply an immature Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions_Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The small triangular posteriorly oriented nasal crest of Probrachylophosaurus is proposed to represent a transitional nasal morphology between that of a non-crested ancestor such as Acristavus and the large flat posteriorly oriented nasal crest of adult Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Probrachylophosaurus is stratigraphically and morphologically intermediate between these taxa, Probrachylophosaurus is hypothesized to be an intermediate member of the Acristavus-Brachylophosaurus evolutionary lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hadrosaurid dinosaurs were prominent members of Late Cretaceous Campanian ecosystems of North America, with an abundance of diverse taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The later portion of the Campanian included solid-crested hadrosaurines coexisting with hollow-crested lambeosaurines, but earlier in the Campanian, hadrosaurines were the most abundant hadrosaurids (See Materials and Methods section regarding use of the term hadrosaurine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive bonebeds in the Two Medicine and Judith River Formations of Montana preserve numerous individuals of hadrosaurine taxa such as Maiasaura peeblesorum and Brachylophosaurus canadensis [1, 2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genera are members of the clade Brachylophosaurini, which includes the recently described basal taxon Acristavus gagslarsoni [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Acristavus, named for its lack of nasal crest, is found in the lower Two Medicine Formation of Montana (Fig 1; [3]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maiasaura and Brachylophosaurus are more typical hadrosaurines in having prominent nasal crests, and are found stratigraphically higher than Acristavus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maiasaura, with its dorsally projecting nasofrontal crest, is known from the upper half of the Two Medicine Formation [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brachylophosaurus canadensis specimens have posteriorly oriented flat paddle-shaped nasal crests, and are likely all from the Comrey Sandstone Zone of the middle Oldman Formation of Alberta and its Judith River Formation equivalent in Montana [7, 8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previously published taxon from lower Oldman-equivalent deposits, Brachylophosaurus goodwini [9], has been referred to Brachylophosaurus canadensis [1] and is here considered referable only to Brachylophosaurini indet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  due to the state of preservation of the holotype and the lack of a preserved nasal crest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Members of Brachylophosaurini indicated in blue: Acristavus gagslarsoni, Probrachylophosaurus bergei gen. et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., Brachylophosaurus canadensis, and Maiasaura peeblesorum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiometric dates are indicated in dark gray, and have been recalibrated to the Fish Canyon sanidine standard (28.305 +/- 0.036 Ma) of Renne et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10] from the originally published values [1115]; see text and Table 1 for further recalibration details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Stratigraphically intermediate deposits between Acristavus and Brachylophosaurus include the lower Judith River Formation of Montana, and the corresponding Foremost and lower Oldman Formations of Alberta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although several partial skeletons have been excavated from the Foremost and lower Oldman Formations and their Judith River Formation equivalents, no species-level diagnostic hadrosaurid material has previously been collected near the Foremost-Oldman Formation boundary, resulting in a gap in our knowledge of Campanian hadrosaur evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paper describes MOR 2919, a specimen with a relatively complete skull from this stratigraphic interval in Kennedy Coulee, northcentral Montana, which fills in the gap with a transitional morphology between the known taxa Acristavus gagslarsoni and Brachylophosaurus canadensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Study_Areas  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kennedy Coulee is a richly fossiliferous exposure of the Judith River Formation (Late Cretaceous: Campanian) located in Hill County, northcentral Montana, and joins the valley of the Milk River near the USA-Canada border (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Alberta, Judith River Formation equivalent deposits are named the Belly River Group, and include the Foremost, Oldman, and Dinosaur Park Formations (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Montanan Judith River Formation is not subdivided into the formal units of the Belly River Group, the depositional sequences that created the Foremost, Oldman, and Dinosaur Park Formations can be identified in Montana outcrop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the terminology of these Canadian formations and their members enables detailed stratigraphic placement of fossiliferous localities, facilitating comparison of the hadrosaurids and other fauna over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Exposures in and near Kennedy Coulee are equivalent to the uppermost Foremost Formation and lowermost Oldman Formation of Alberta, according to multiple lines of evidence: lithologic, radiometric, and biostratigraphic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The base of the coulee exposes a thick coal, the Marker A Coal, equivalent to the top of the Taber Coal Zone of the Foremost Formation, capped by a white-gray amalgamated channel sandstone equivalent to the Herronton Sandstone Zone at the top of the Foremost Formation (sensu [13]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper portion of Kennedy Coulee, where MOR 2919 was collected, is dominated by mudstones and corresponds to Unit 1 (the lowest unit) of the Oldman Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ceratopsian Medusaceratops was also collected from this upper mudstone zone of Kennedy Coulee [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To facilitate comparison of radiometric dates from various formations and publications, all relevant dates were recalibrated to the Fish Canyon sanidine standard of 28.305 Â± 0.036 Ma using the method of Renne et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Published and recalibrated dates for relevant portions of the Judith River Formation, Belly River Group, Two Medicine Formation, and Wahweap Formation are listed in Table 1, and recalibrated dates are plotted on Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0141304.t001  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Published radiometric dates from the upper mudstone zone and lower coal zone of Kennedy Coulee constrain the age of MOR 2919 between 78.5 +/- 0.2 Ma and 78.2 +/- 0.2 Ma according to the old standard of 520.4 +/- 1.7 Ma for MMhb-1 [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversion and recalibration to the Fish Canyon sanidine standard mentioned above adjusts these dates to 79.8 +/- 0.2 Ma and 79.5 +/- 0.2 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed stratigraphic position of Kennedy Coulee is consistent with its radiometric age within the range of recalibrated dates from the lower Foremost (80.45 +/- 0.16 Ma) and upper Oldman Formations (77.76 +/- 0.51 Ma) of Alberta [12, 13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ray teeth collected from microsites throughout Kennedy Coulee, from the Herronton Sandstone to Unit 1 of the Oldman Formation, possess smooth-sided crowns, and are thus referable to Pseudomyledaphus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (S1 Text, S1 Fig) [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Alberta, Pseudomyledaphus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are only found in the Foremost and lowermost Oldman Formations [2022], supporting the assignment of MOR 2919s locality to the lowermost Oldman Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brachylophosaurus canadensis specimens collected in Alberta all likely originate from the Oldman Formation (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotype of B. canadensis, CMN 8893, was collected in 1936 from the Comrey Sandstone Zone (Unit 2) of the middle Oldman Formation near the Red Deer River, within what is now Dinosaur Provincial Park ([23]; D. A. Eberth personal communication 2011).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A partial skull, FMNH PR 862, had also been collected in Dinosaur Provincial Park in 1922 [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FMNH PR 862 was more recently erroneously associated with the Two Medicine Formation [1, 25], but outcrops along the Red Deer River include the Oldman and Dinosaur Park Formations, and so FMNH PR 862 was likely collected from a similar stratigraphic level as the holotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third skull and partial skeleton, TMP 1990.104.001, was collected from a sandstone at an unspecified level of the Oldman Formation near the Milk River outside of the towns of Onefour and Manyberries [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these three specimens, only the holotype is confirmed to be from the Comrey Sandstone Zone, but there is no evidence to suggest that the other two specimens originate from a different horizon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0141304.t002  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although Alberta was the source of the holotype, the majority of known Brachylophosaurus canadensis specimens, including a complete adult skeleton (MOR 794), an articulated subadult with skin impressions (JRF 115), and a bonebed containing individuals of various sizes (MOR 1071), were collected from the Judith River Formation exposed near Malta, Montana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Malta is 200 km east of Kennedy Coulee, and thus more distal along the depositional wedge and closer to the Western Interior Seaway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Malta area, the base of the Judith River Formation is the shoreface Parkman Sandstone, which is overlain by tan colored, quartz-rich sandstones [8] equivalent to the Comrey Sandstone Zone of the middle Oldman Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strata equivalent to the Foremost Formation and lower Oldman Formation are not present in the distal wedge deposits of Malta (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ray teeth collected with MOR 1071 are referable to Myledaphus bipartitus (S1 Text), which, in Alberta, are only found in the Comrey Sandstone Zone and higher units [21], supporting the assignment of the Malta B. canadensis localities to the Comrey Sandstone Zone of the Oldman Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Kennedy Coulee and MOR 2919 are stratigraphically older than Brachylophosaurus canadensis specimens from Alberta and Malta, Montana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A second species of Brachylophosaurus, B. goodwini, was described from Kennedy Coulee, Hill County, northcentral Montana [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cranial material of the holotype, UCMP 130139, was fragmentary and missing the nasal crest, and so was deemed undiagnostic and referred to B. canadensis [1, 23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the lack of a preserved nasal crest as well as its severe frontal depressions, UCMP 130139 cannot be confidently referred to either B. canadensis or the new genus described here, and is assigned to Brachylophosaurini indet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (see Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MOR 2919 was collected by Museum of the Rockies and University of California Museum of Paleontology crews using standard paleontology field techniques [27] on privately owned land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MOR 2919 was generously donated to the Museum of the Rockies by Nolan and Cheryl Fladstol and John and Claire Wendland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No permits were required for the described study, which complied with all relevant regulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Terminology in this paper follows traditional conventions and definitions of Hadrosauridae and Hadrosaurinae [28] rather than the proposed alternate names of Saurolophidae and Saurolophinae [29] for reasons of taxonomic stability as detailed in Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MOR 2919 was compared morphologically to other hadrosaurine specimens and casts at MOR, ROM, TMP, and UCMP, as well as published descriptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were taken directly from the specimens or casts using a tape measure or digital calipers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the phylogenetic relationships of MOR 2919 within Hadrosaurinae, the specimen was coded into the phylogenetic matrices of Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3] and Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These matrices were selected because Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3] is the description of Acristavus, one of the taxa most morphologically similar to MOR 2919, and Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] is a landmark study, the largest, most comprehensive analysis of all Hadrosauridae to that date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The matrices from both studies were used, because although they both have origins in the Horner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [28] matrix, the Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3] matrix alters few characters, whereas the Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] matrix substantially expands the character list, yielding two extremely different matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If both matrices yield the same placement of MOR 2919, then its phylogienetic position can be considered very well supported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To simplify the analyses and focus on relationships within the clade of interest (Brachylophosaurini), as well as to make the taxon lists of these matrices as similar as possible, most lambeosaurine and basal hadrosauroid taxa were removed from Prieto-MÃ¡rquezs [29] and Gates et al.s [3] matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relationships within lambeosaurines and basal hadrosauroids are thoroughly investigated in Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] and need not be repeated here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iguanodon bernissartensis was retained for use as the outgroup, consistent with Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] and Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bactrosaurus johnsoni was retained as a representative hadrosauroid because it is the most complete hadrosauroid in the matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hadrosaurus foulkii, although not included in the Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3] matrix, was retained in the Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] matrix due to the taxons variable position in different phylogenetic analyses and its importance in defining the terms Hadrosauridae and Hadrosaurinae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corythosaurus casuarius was retained as a representative lambeosaurine, consistent with Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several incomplete hadrosaurine taxa (coded with a high percentage of ?)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  outside of Brachylophosaurini were removed from both matrices to simplify the analysis and improve resolution of Brachylophosaurini and the other major, well-defined hadrosaurine clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The removed taxa were: Barsboldia sicinskii, Kerberosaurus manakini, Sabinas OTU, Salitral Moreno OTU (Willinakaqe), Shantungosaurus giganteus, and UTEP OTU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several character states in the published Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] matrix were recoded, and after initial analysis, some characters were amended or excluded in a second analysis (see Phylogenetic Analyses section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No character states were recoded in the Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3] matrix, and no characters were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, phylogenetic analyses were performed on a total of three matrices: 1) the matrix of Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] with all characters included (19 taxa, 370 characters; S1 File); 2) the matrix of Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] with some characters amended or excluded (19 taxa, 367 characters; S2 File); 3) the matrix of Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3] with all characters included (13 taxa, 116 characters; S3 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The matrices were analyzed with parsimony in PAUP 4.0b10 [30] within a heuristic search of 5,000 replicates using ACCTRAN optimization and tree bisection-reconnection swapping to produce the most parsimonious trees, which were then combined into a strict consensus tree, and followed by a bootstrap analysis using a heuristic search of 5,000 replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete PAUP settings used are provided in the nexus files (S1S3 Files).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3] matrix, the bootstrap replicates were increased to 50,000 due to the support values for certain clades being extremely close to the cutoff value of 50%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogeny figures were time-calibrated by drawing the cladograms using published age ranges (in Ma) for Cretaceous taxa; dates for members of Brachylophosaurini were recalibrated as in Table 1 and Fig 1, using the method of Renne et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The left tibia of MOR 2919 was histologically sampled using the techniques of Lamm [31] for large specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mid-diaphyseal segment with minimum circumference was removed, molded and cast, and embedded in resin for histological sectioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the large dimensions of the tibia (anteroposterior mid-diaphysis cross-sectional diameter maximum 13.35 cm, mediolateral diameter minimum 10.60 cm), the transverse cross-section was cut into three parts (anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral) that were mounted on separate slides and ground to a thickness of 100 m. The finished slides were imaged at 10x and 40x total magnification on a Nikon Optiphot-Pol polarizing microscope with a Nikon DS-Fi1 digital sight camera utilizing an automated stage to move the slide incrementally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting photomicrographs were compiled with NIS-Elements BR 3.0 software into high-resolution TIFF image files.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adobe Photoshop CS2 was used to combine the images of the three slides and trace the circumference of each line of arrested growth (LAG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These circumferences were then measured with ImageJ 1.46r [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the left tibia was slightly crushed, several cortical segments were displaced radially inward, resulting in the LAG tracings overestimating the true circumference due to the LAGs on either side of a displacement needing to be connected by a radially oriented line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was corrected for each LAG individually by subtracting the length of these radial lines at the three areas of greatest displacement (anterolateral, posterolateral, posteromedial) from the total LAG circumference measured in ImageJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The left tibia of MOR 2919 was originally collected by UCMP in 1981 and curated as UCMP 137272.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limb bones prepared at UCMP at the time sometimes included a metal rebar rod and epoxy inserted into the medullary cavity for rigid support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the tibia was transferred to MOR collections and sectioned for histology, the rebar was cut out of the tibia segments prior to mounting them on slides to avoid grinding metal on histological equipment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This created the open space seen in the center of the medullary cavity on the finished slides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Osteological_Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The focus of this description is to highlight features of MOR 2919 that differ from other specimens of Brachylophosaurini, are phylogenetically significant, or that may be ontogenetically variable in hadrosaurids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characters not mentioned are either unobservable in the preserved elements of MOR 2919, or are consistent with Brachylophosaurus canadensis and related hadrosaurs [1, 23, 33], such that descriptions need not be duplicated here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparative specimens of B. canadensis used herein are identified by specimen number rather than simply genus and species name due to slight morphologic differences among specimens (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, morphologic descriptions of B. canadensis are based on the holotype, CMN 8893, for characters observable on an articulated skull, and MOR 1071 for characters only observable on disarticulated specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless otherwise indicated, all morphologic descriptions of Acristavus are based on MOR 1155 (holotype; [3]), Maiasaura on YPM-PU 22405 (holotype; [5]), Gryposaurus on CMN 2278 (holotype of Gryposaurus notabilis; [34]), and Prosaurolophus on MOR 454 (holotype of Prosaurolophus blackfeetensis; [35]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For features not preserved on the Maiasaura holotype, a referred specimen (OTM F138) of uncertain stratigraphic position is used for comparison [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MOR 2919 (Fig 3) represents one of the largest brachylophosaurin specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exact comparisons of cranial dimensions among specimens are difficult due to diagenetic compression affecting each specimen to a different degree and direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for specimens with associated postcrania, comparisons are more straightforward (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the relative size of individuals does not necessarily indicate the same degree of relative maturity, the larger size of MOR 2919 suggests that it is an adult, not merely an immature specimen of B. canadensis; this conclusion is supported by its axial fusion and osteohistology (see Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

SkullBraincase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The braincase elements are fully fused and suture lines are either in the process of being remodeled or are already obliterated (Fig 15), making the contacts of individual elements difficult to define, as in CMN 8893 [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crushing has obscured some cranial nerve foramina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from the features noted below, the overall morphology conforms to that of Brachylophosaurus [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The large alar process of the basisphenoid is extremely thin, as in Brachylophosaurus (MOR 1071-7-7-98-86); the proximal-distal striations are more prominent in MOR 2919.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The posteroventral process of the basisphenoid is more pronounced in MOR 2919 than in Maiasaura (OTM F138), Acristavus, and some Brachylophosaurus specimens (MOR 1071-7-7-98-86), but smaller than in others (CMN 8893; [23]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Brachylophosaurus (MOR 1071-7-7-98-86) and Acristavus the pterygoid processes of the basisphenoid are directed nearly entirely laterally, and slightly anteriorly and ventrally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MOR 2919 and Maiasaura (OTM F138) the pterygoid processes are directed more ventrally than laterally, and slightly posteriorly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much of this difference may be diagenetic; the braincases of MOR 1071-7-7-98-86 and MOR 1155 are dorsoventrally compressed, MOR 2919 is laterally compressed, and OTM F138 is slightly laterally compressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direction of compression likely determines the relative degree of lateral or ventral orientation of the pterygoid processes, and may determine whether the pterygoid processes are directed slightly anteriorly or posteriorly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the angle between the pterygoid processes of the basisphenoid is not a useful phylogenetic character without first accounting for diagenetic influence on all specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In MOR 2919 as in Brachylophosaurus (CMN 8893, MOR 1071-7-7-98-86), the opening for cranial nerve VII is slightly posteroventral to cranial nerve V, rather than directly posterior as in Acristavus (UMNHVP 16607) [3, 23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The groove in the opisthotic leading from cranial nerve VIII to the exoccipital is much wider and deeper in Brachylophosaurus (MOR 1071-7-7-98-86) than in MOR 2919.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paraoccipital processes of the exoccipitals barely curve anteriorly, similar to Brachylophosaurus (CMN 8893, MOR 794), and unlike the strong anterior curvature in Acristavus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region of the posterior-most contacts between the squamosals, supraoccipital, and exoccipitals is broken, but if intact the exoccipital roof would have been short as in Brachylophosaurus (MOR 1071-7-7-98-86).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Postcrania  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In nearly all respects, the postcrania of MOR 2919 are consistent with those of Acristavus and Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pathologies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pathologies are present on both dentaries, at least six caudal vertebrae, and two metatarsals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dentaries of MOR 2919 possess a total of three pathologic circular depressions each surrounded by a ring of raised bone (Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six middle caudal vertebrae of MOR 2919 exhibit neural spine pathologies consistent with various degrees of breakage and healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathologies are limited to a single region of the middle of the tail (Fig 19); the caudal series is disarticulated and incomplete, so there may have been additional pathologic vertebrae within this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only two metatarsals recovered, the right II and IV, both exhibit pathologic rugose surface texture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The right metatarsal II has this rugose texture on much of its contact surface with metatarsal III, and nowhere else.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The right metatarsal IV has the rugose texture concentrated on its medial contact surface with metatarsal III, as well as it distal posterolateral surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metatarsal III was not recovered, but presumably would have suffered from a similar pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distal ends of both tibiae and both fibulae exhibit patches of pathologic surface texture, suggesting that both feet may have been similarly affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathologies of MOR 2919 will be described and discussed in detail in a later paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Summary_of_Morphologic_Comparisons_Among_Probrachylophosaurus_and_Other_Brachylophosaurins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In cases where cranial morphology can be directly compared between Probrachylophosaurus, Acristavus, Brachylophosaurus, and Maiasaura, Probrachylophosaurus is always more similar to Acristavus or Brachylophosaurus than it is to Maiasaura.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the cranial elements well-preserved in the Probrachylophosaurus material, those with the most useful features for comparing brachylophosaurins are the jugal, lacrimal, nasal, frontal, squamosal, quadrate, braincase, and dentary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The palatine process of the jugal in subadult Probrachylophosaurus (MOR 1097) is identical to the stratigraphically older Acristavus, but the palatine process of the jugal in adult Probrachylophosaurus (MOR 2919) is most similar to the stratigraphically younger Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The palatine process in Maiasaura is more similar to Acristavus and subadult Probrachylophosaurus than to Brachylophosaurus and adult Probrachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The caudoventral apex of the rostral process of the jugal is posterior to the caudodorsal apex in both Probrachylophosaurus and Acristavus; the apices are vertically aligned in Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maiasaura possesses an intermediate condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ventral margin of the rostral process of the jugal is nearly straight in Probrachylophosaurus, Acristavus, and Maiasaura, but sigmoidal in Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concavity of the posterior jugal margin is shallow in Probrachylophosaurus, Acristavus, and Maiasaura, but deeper in Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medial excavation of the quadratojugal process of the jugal is shallowest in Probrachylophosaurus, less shallow in Acristavus, and deepest in Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mediolateral width of the lacrimal is more thick and robust in Probrachylophosaurus and Acristavus than in Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Probrachylophosaurus and Brachylophosaurus are united by having a solid nasal crest overhanging the dorsal skull roof; Acristavus lacks any crest, and Maiasaura has a crest formed by the dorsal projection of both the nasals and frontals [3, 5, 6, 33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nasal crest of the smaller adult (slender) Brachylophosaurus resembles a hypermorphic form of a Probrachylophosaurus crest, extending the crest posteriorly and laterally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger adult (robust) Brachylophosaurus crest continues this growth trajectory, with the posterolateral growth forming a flat paddle shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These taxa have the same pattern in their nasofrontal articulation; subadult Brachylophosaurus and adult Probrachylophosaurus possess a nasofrontal articulation covering slightly over half of the dorsal frontal surface, whereas adult Brachylophosaurus have a larger nasofrontal articulation that covers the entire dorsal frontal surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The frontal contribution to the orbital margin is more similar in Probrachylophosaurus and Acristavus than either is to that of Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prequadratic process of the squamosal in Probrachylophosaurus is more similar to that of subadult Brachylophosaurus than adult Brachylophosaurus or Acristavus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The postquadratic process of the squamosal is similar in Probrachylophosaurus, Acristavus, and Brachylophosaurus, and different from that of Maiasaura.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The posterior end of the postorbital-squamosal articulation occurs just anterior to the middle of the quadrate cotylus in Acristavus, in the middle of the cotylus in Probrachylophosaurus and some Brachylophosaurus specimens (FMNH PR 862), and just posterior to the middle in other Brachylophosaurus (MOR 794, MOR 1071-7-7-98-86).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Probrachylophosaurus and Acristavus, the squamosals contact each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Maiasaura, the squamosals are partially separated by the parietal, and in Brachylophosaurus, the squamosals are completely separated by the parietal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of cranial nerve VII, as well as the curvature of the paraoccipital processes of the exoccipitals, are more similar in Probrachylophosaurus and Brachylophosaurus than either taxon is to Acristavus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The size and shape of the posterodorsal process of the quadrate is similar in Probrachylophosaurus and Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process in Acristavus is shorter and smaller; the process in Maiasaura is intermediate between Probrachylophosaurus and Acristavus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quadrate posterior margin is straight in Probrachylophosaurus and Acristavus, but curved in Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The position of the ventromedial groove of the dentary of Probrachylophosaurus is more similar to Acristavus and Maiasaura OTM F138 than to Brachylophosaurus or Maiasaura YPM-PU 22405.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximal edentulous slope of the dentary is shorter in Probrachylophosaurus, Maiasaura, and Acristavus than it is in Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximal-most portion of the edentulous slope is immediately sloping in Probrachylophosaurus and Acristavus, but horizontal in Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Probrachylophosaurus exhibits a unique combination of characters that make it morphologically intermediate between Acristavus and Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probrachylophosaurus is most similar to Acristavus in overall morphology of the jugal and lacrimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphologies of the frontal, quadrate, and squamosal are more similar to Acristavus in some attributes, but more similar to Brachylophosaurus in others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The braincase of Probrachylophosaurus is most similar to Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a posteriorly-oriented nasal crest also unites Probrachylophosaurus with Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dentary is more similar to that of Acristavus than to Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These relationships of morphological similarities and differences were analyzed in more detail using phylogenetic analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Phylogenetic_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analyses_based_on_matrix_of_Prieto-MÃ¡rquez_[29]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Probrachylophosaurus bergei was coded into two versions of the matrix of Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first version included some recodings of previous taxa, with all characters included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second version included these same recodings, but excluded some characters as detailed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first analysis using the Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] matrix included recodings of eight characters for Acristavus based on reexamination of the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] for complete descriptions of characters and abbreviation codes (e.g., J4 is the fourth jugal character).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Character 106 (J4), the relative position of the caudoventral apex of the rostral process of the jugal, was changed from state 1 to 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probrachylophosaurus is also coded as 0; Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura are state 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quadrate of the Acristavus holotype (MOR 1155) was not coded into the original matrix, so it has been added here, replacing characters 116121 (Q1-Q6)??????  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with 011211.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are the same codings as the quadrate of Probrachylophosaurus and Brachylophosaurus; Maiasaura has states 001211.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Character 259 (PB8), the length/width ratio of the ischial peduncle of the pubis, was recoded from 0 to 1 for Acristavus; Probrachylophosaurus, Brachylophosaurus, and Maiasaura are also state 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Brachylophosaurus, Character 138 (F1) was originally coded as state 0, indicating the lack of bifurcation of the anterior frontal margin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this is only true for some adult specimens (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GPDM JRF.65); the slender adult Brachylophosaurus MOR 1071-7-7-98-86 and subadults MOR 1071-7-13-99-87-I and MOR 1071-C-3-3 have bifurcated anterior frontal margins, so this was recoded to the multistate 01.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When Probrachylophosaurus bergei is added to Prieto-MÃ¡rquezs [29] matrix, with extraneous taxa removed and some character states recoded (see above), but all characters included (S1 File), four most parsimonious trees were produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strict consensus tree recovers Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura as sister taxa, with Probrachylophosaurus and Acristavus forming a basal polytomy within Brachylophosaurini (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characters responsible for the position of Probrachylophosaurus included: 1 (dtth1), number of dentary tooth positions; 15 (mxth1), number of maxillary tooth positions; 36 (dt4), angle of the ventral rostral margin of the dentary; 44 (dt13), lack of caudodorsal point on coronoid process of dentary; 106 (j4), relative positions of caudodorsal and caudoventral apices of rostral process of jugal; 110 (j8), size of caudoventral flange of jugal; 113 (j11), ratio of caudal and rostral constrictions of jugal; and 143 (f6), contribution of the frontal to the orbital margin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bootstrap 50% majority-rule consensus tree (5,000 replicates) finds 55% support for a Probrachylophosaurus-Brachylophosaurus-Maiasaura clade, with Acristavus as the basal member of Brachylophosaurini, and 64% support for Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura as sister taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three of Prieto-MÃ¡rquezs [29] characters were then excluded from the second analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characters 1 (dtth1) and 15 (mxth1) are based on the number of teeth in the dentary and maxilla, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of teeth in hadrosaurid jaws increases ontogenetically [37, 38], so the high tooth counts in MOR 2919 are liable to be due to the specimens size and maturity rather than a true phylogenetic signal separating it from Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Character 123 (pf2) describes the shape of the prefrontal contribution to the orbital margin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many specimens of Brachylophosaurini examined in this study are intermediate between the character states, and so this character was excluded to avoid ambiguous state assignments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Character 143 (f6) in Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] is a modification of character 57 in Horner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contribution of the frontal to the orbital margin is either present or absent in Horner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [28], but Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] divides presence into two states, frontal exposed and forming part of orbital margin, or forming a narrow triangular apex that may or may not reach the orbital margin between the prefrontal and postorbital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This division is problematic because the width of the orbital contribution of the frontal is intraspecifically variable in Brachylophosaurus (MOR 1071 braincases, FMNH PR 862), and potentially may vary similarly in other taxa that currently have smaller sample sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the distinction between the two states (frontal forming part of orbital margin or doing so through a narrow triangular apex) is not well defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] codes Acristavus, Brachylophosaurus, and Maiasaura as having the narrow triangular apex, but their contribution to the orbital margin can be more than 1 cm and not triangular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the frontal contribution to the orbital margin, when present, forms a continuum rather than two discrete states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  End members are clear, but most brachylophosaurin specimens fall in between the end points, and so the original version of the character (simply presence or absence of frontal contribution to the orbital margin) in Horner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [28] is preferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, character 143 (f6) was recoded to merge states 0 and 1, so there are only two states (presence or absence) rather than three.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After these exclusions and recodings (S2 File), two most parsimonious trees were produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strict consensus tree recovers Acristavus as the basal member of Brachylophosaurini, with Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura as sister taxa, and Probrachylophosaurus in an intermediate position (Fig 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probrachylophosaurus, Brachylophosaurus, and Maiasaura, but not Acristavus, share one apomorphic character state: 134 (sq1) state 0, very short precotyloid process of the squamosal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probrachylophosaurus differs from Acristavus, Brachylophosaurus, and Maiasaura in its state for three characters: 36 (dt4) state 2, angle of the ventral rostral margin of the dentary; 110 (j8) state 1, size of the caudoventral flange of the jugal; and 113 (j11) state 2, ratio of caudal and rostral constrictions of the jugal; these character states are homoplasies shared with non-brachylophosaurin hadrosaurine taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura are united as sister taxa due to two characters: 44 (dt13) state 1, the autapomorphic presence of a caudodorsal point on the coronoid process of the dentary; and 106 (j4) state 1, relative positions of caudodorsal and caudoventral apices of the rostral process of the jugal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to the previous result, this bootstrap 50% majority-rule consensus tree finds increased (66%, was 55%) support for a Probrachylophosaurus-Brachylophosaurus-Maiasaura clade, with Acristavus as the basal member of Brachylophosaurini, and decreased (56%, was 64%) support for Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura as sister taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_based_on_matrix_of_Gates_et_al_[3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When Probrachylophosaurus bergei is added to Gates et al.s [3] matrix, with extraneous taxa removed (see Methods), but all characters included (S3 File), two most parsimonious trees were produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strict consensus tree recovers Probrachylophosaurus and Brachylophosaurus as sister taxa, with Acristavus as the basalmost member of Brachylophosaurini (Fig 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probrachylophosaurus, Brachylophosaurus, and Maiasaura, but not Acristavus, share two apomorphic character states: character 36 state 1, presence of solid nasal crest; and character 37 state 1, circumnarial fossa terminates anterior to nasal crest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acristavus, Probrachylophosaurus, and Maiasaura, but not Brachylophosaurus, share one apomorphic character state: character 53 state 0, straight to slightly curved ventral margin of the rostral process of the jugal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probrachylophosaurus and Brachylophosaurus are united as sister taxa due to one apomorphic character state: character 105 state 0, postacetabular process is less than 40 percent the total length of the ilium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probrachylophosaurus differs from Acristavus, Brachylophosaurus, and Maiasaura in its state for one character: character 72 state 0, low basipterygoid transverse ridge of the basisphenoid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bootstrap 50% majority-rule consensus tree (50,000 replicates) finds 50% support for Probrachylophosaurus and Brachylophosaurus as sister taxa, with the positions of Acristavus and Maiasaura having less than 50% support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_Relationships  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brachylophosaurini is supported as a robust clade in all recent phylogenetic analyses, but the relationships amongst its members vary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior to the description of Acristavus gagslarsoni, this clade consisted solely of Maiasaura peeblesorum and Brachylophosaurus canadensis [1, 28, 43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] recovered Maiasaura and Brachylophosaurus as sister taxa, with Acristavus (Two Medicine OTU) as the basal member of the clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3] recovered Acristavus and Maiasaura as sister taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When Probrachylophosaurus is added to the Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] and Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3] matrices, it is recovered with confidence as a member of Brachylophosaurini (bootstrap support 87% in both analyses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acristavus is recovered as the basal taxon in all analyses, consistent with its stratigraphic position; thus, Acristavus or a close relative was likely ancestral to the rest of Brachylophosaurini.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inclusion of Probrachylophosaurus in the Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] matrix still results in Maiasaura and Brachylophosaurus as sister taxa, but with much weaker bootstrap support for the clade (56% vs. 69% in [29]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probrachylophosaurus is recovered as intermediate between Acristavus and the Brachylophosaurus-Maiasaura clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inclusion of Probrachylophosaurus in the Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3] matrix yields Probrachylophosaurus and Brachylophosaurus as sister taxa, with Maiasaura intermediate between them and Acristavus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differing positions of Maiasaura relative to Probrachylophosaurus and Brachylophosaurus in each analysis leads to uncertainty regarding the timing of the cladogenic split between the Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis based on the Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3] matrix suggests that Maiasaura diverged from the Probrachylophosaurus-Brachylophosaurus lineage sometime between the stratigraphic existence of Acristavus and Probrachylophosaurus (Fig 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis based on the Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] matrix suggests that the Maiasaura lineage either diverged from the Brachylophosaurus lineage sometime between the stratigraphic existence of Probrachylophosaurus and Brachylophosaurus, or Maiasaura is derived from Brachylophosaurus (Fig 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the analysis based on the Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [29] matrix, Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura are united by two characters: 44 (dt13) caudodorsal point on the coronoid process of the dentary and 106 (j4) position of the caudoventral apex of the rostral process of the jugal relative to the caudodorsal margin of the rostral process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The caudodorsal point on the coronoid process of the dentary is potentially very useful for taxon identification, but is also problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The caudodorsal margins of Brachylophosaurini coronoid processes are very thin, and are broken in many specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The caudodorsal margins of the coronoid processes of Acristavus and Probrachylophosaurus are extremely thin and partially broken; they do not preserve points, and the thinness of the bone seems to indicate that there could not have been a point, but this cannot be confirmed with absolute confidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the caudodorsal point enlarges ontogenetically in Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura; small individuals lack the point entirely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the maturity of a specimen lacking the caudodorsal point must be considered before including it in phylogenetic analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Acristavus and Probrachylophosaurus holotypes are from large enough individuals that they should display the adult condition for this character.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Character 106 (j4) concerns the relative positions of the caudodorsal and caudoventral points of the rostral process of the jugal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maiasaura is coded as having the same state as Brachylophosaurus; the caudoventral point is directly ventral to the caudodorsal point, rather than being posterior to the caudodorsal point as it is in Acristavus and Probrachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in Maiasaura, the caudoventral point is slightly posterior to the caudodorsal point, and so is actually intermediate between the states of Acristavus-Probrachylophosaurus and Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the phylogenetic analyses concur in placing Acristavus as the basal-most member of the Brachylophosaurini, consistent with its relative stratigraphic position, but the relationships among Probrachylophosaurus, Brachylophosaurus, and Maiasaura vary depending on the cladistic matrix used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Histology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The left tibia of MOR 2919 includes 14 lines of arrested growth (LAGs) (Figs 24 and 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because LAGs represent annual interruptions in bone growth [52], this indicates that MOR 2919 was 14 years old at time of death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outermost LAGS (1114) are closely spaced, yet still retain vascularity, and so cannot be considered an External Fundamental System (EFS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that MOR 2919 was still increasing its tibia circumference, and therefore presumably still increasing it body length and body mass, at time of death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Numbered green arrows identify lines of arrested growth (LAGs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The closely spaced outer LAGs are indicated with tick marks along a green line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbers around the circumference of the cross-section indicate the number of LAGs preserved in that radial segment of the tibia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that diagenetic crushing has displaced several segments radially inward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thumbnail image in lower right corner colors the area between each pair of LAGs to highlight locations of radial displacement as well as to indicate bone deposition between later LAGs occurring primarily along the posteromedial region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high-resolution version of this figure is available at http://www.morphobank.org/index.php/Projects/Media/id/377387/project_id/2157.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

This is a higher-resolution image of the posteromedial cortex pictured in Fig 24, as indicated by the black box on the upper right thumbnail image of the entire mid-diaphyseal cross-section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbered green arrows identify lines of arrested growth (LAGs), including the multiple lines of LAG zone 8 (see text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high-resolution version of this figure is available at http://www.morphobank.org/index.php/Projects/Media/id/377388/project_id/2157.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Bone apposition rates in hadrosaurids are generally greater on the posteromedial side of the cortex than on the anterolateral cortex (H. N. Woodward, personal communication 2013).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MOR 2919, this produced thicker zones between early LAGs on the posteromedial side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later, bone deposition continued on the posteromedial side while it had ceased on the lateral side, resulting in the highest number of LAGs (14) countable on the posteromedial side, with the number of LAGs decreasing along the posterolateral (128 LAGs) and anteromedial (1311 LAGs) cortex, and the fewest number of LAGs (8) countable on the lateral cortex (Fig 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LAGs 112 are well defined and visible at 10x total magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When present, LAGs 13 and 14 are visible at 40x total magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LAG 13 is visible as a darkened band that sometimes contains one or more lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, LAG 13 may not actually be a LAG, but may instead be an annulus, which represents an annual marker of growth that slowed but did not actually stop as it would in a LAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LAG 14, when present, is extremely close to the outer surface of the cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generally, the zone thickness (spacing between LAGs) decreased each year, indicating a faster growth rate in the first few years of life, followed by a gradual decrease in growth rate (Fig 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, LAGs 5, 6, and 7 are relatively closely spaced, with wider growth zones occurring between later LAGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may indicate that the two growing seasons in between LAGs 5 and 6, and 6 and 7, were stressful times of low access to resources, and so growth was limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Age in years was determined by counting the number of lines of arrested growth within the tibial cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MOR 2919 left tibia is 119 cm long.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maiasaura data are taken from the largest tibia with complete histologic data (93 cm long) from Woodward et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflection points in the growth of Probrachylophosaurus occur at 5 years and 10 years; these inflection points occur earlier in Maiasaura, at 23 years and 8 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Maiasaura, the first inflection point is interpreted as sexual maturity, and the second inflection point occurs at the initiation of the external fundamental system (EFS), representing skeletal maturity [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although MOR 2919 has an apparent second inflection point, it does not possess an EFS, so it is not skeletally mature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

LAG 8 is actually a zone of one to five closely spaced lines occurring after a zone of typical annual bone deposition (Fig 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the locations of outermost LAG deposition, LAG zone 8 contains the most lines (five) on the posteromedial side of the tibia, decreasing incrementally around the circumference, with a single line along the anterolateral to posterolateral sides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This LAG zone is interpreted as the result of a mild unfavorable season (sensu KÃ¶hler et al., 2012), perhaps a mild winter, during which small increments of bone deposition occurred between multiple pauses in growth, rather than the typical single cessation of growth for the entire unfavorable season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circumference of LAG 8 was measured at the outermost line of the zone, because the outer circumference of this line marks the resumption of growth in the favorable season, as it does for all other LAGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The bone is minimally remodeled, such that LAG 1 is clearly visible along most of its circumference, and still faintly visible on the anterior side where secondary osteons mostly obscure the original bone texture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary osteons are mainly confined to the area between the medullary cavity and LAG 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated secondary osteons are also scattered sparsely throughout the cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only area of intensive remodeling outside of LAG 1 occurs as a narrow fountain of secondary osteons leading from the medullary cavity to the anterolateral outer cortex (Fig 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This location corresponds to the anterolateral border of the tibia, along which runs the M. tibialis anterior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dilkes [54, 55] notes that in turtles, Sphenodon, and squamates, the M. tibialis anterior originates on the anterior, medial, and lateral sides of the diaphysis of the tibia, whereas in crocodilians it originates from the proximolateral surface of the tibia, and in birds it originates on the lateral outer cnemial crest of the tibia and the anterior external condyle of the femur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dilkes [54, 55] reconstructed the M. tibialis anterior of Maiasaura as originating on the cnemial crest of the proximal tibia due to the presence of muscle scarring on the cnemial crest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the origin of the M. tibialis anterior actually covered a larger area, continuing down the anterolateral tibial diaphysis, then the fountain of secondary osteons along the anterolateral border of MOR 2919 may be due to it being a muscle attachment area; however, the cortical surface is smooth, with no scarring indicative of muscle attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the anterolateral border of the tibia may simply be an area subjected to great compressive or extensive stress, triggering Haversian remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Margins of the remodeled region are indicated with dashed green lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbered green arrows identify lines of arrested growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dark areas near edge of cortex are sections of bone that began to separate from the slide, requiring additional adhesive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black box on the thumbnail image on lower right indicates location of Fig 27 within the entire tibial cross-section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high-resolution version of this figure is available at http://www.morphobank.org/index.php/Projects/Media/id/377389/project_id/2157.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0141304.g027  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This remodeled region is possibly similar to the anterolateral plug in a Dysalotosaurus (Ornithischia: Dryosauridae) tibia [56], but the fountain in MOR 2919 is a continuous band of fairly consistent width connecting the medullary cavity to the periosteal surface and is nearly entirely composed of secondary osteons; the plug in Dysalotosaurus is whirl-like and may not extend to the medullary cavity or the periosteal surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plug is initially composed of randomly oriented primary osteons, and later contains a higher density of secondary osteons than are found in other areas of the tibial cross-section; it is interpreted as forming due to this area being a muscle attachment site [56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fountain of MOR 2919 and anterolateral plug of Dysalotosaurus are similar in their location and presence of secondary osteons, but the radial extent and degree of remodeling are much greater in MOR 2919.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult Maiasaura also have concentrations of secondary osteons on the anterior side of the tibia that remodel the radial vascularity of the primary bone tissue in this area; Woodward et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [53] hypothesize that this remodeling results from muscle insertion on the anterior tibial border.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Histologic_Maturity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The growth inflection points (Fig 26) occur later in MOR 2919 than in Maiasaura, indicating later sexual and skeletal maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas Maiasaura is hypothesized to reach sexual maturity between two and three years of age [53], the corresponding inflection point in the growth of MOR 2919 occurs at 5 years of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that Probrachylophosaurus had delayed sexual maturity relative to Maiasaura.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the second inflection point, Maiasaura begins depositing an external fundamental system (EFS), indicating skeletal maturity [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MOR 2919 decreases its growth rate at the second inflection point, but does not deposit an EFS, so it has not yet reached true skeletal maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This second decrease in growth rate occurs later in MOR 2919 (10 years) than in the largest sampled Maiasaura tibia (8 years).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The later achievement of the second inflection point, as well as the lack of an EFS, suggests that Probrachylophosaurus attained skeletal maturity later than Maiasaura.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the age of skeletal maturity in Maiasaura is individually variable (Woodward et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in review), so a greater sample size of Probrachylophosaurus is needed to determine whether the apparent delayed maturation relative to Maiasaura is real or simply reflects individual variation in growth rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In either case, MOR 2919s histology suggests that Probrachylophosaurus is a larger-bodied taxon than Maiasaura at all growth stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although MOR 2919 lacks an EFS, its histology confirms that its growth rate had greatly slowed and it was possibly somewhat near skeletal maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, its adult status is supported by three independent lines of evidence: histology, large body size, and externally fused and remodeled axial sutures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The term adult, as applied to MOR 2919, is used to indicate that this is not a subadult specimen that may reasonably be expected to grow a full paddle-shaped nasal crest as seen in Brachylophosaurus canadensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its skull and body size, compared to the size distribution of its close relative B. canadensis, clearly categorize it as an adult sensu Evans [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because MOR 2919 has not attained an EFS, it is technically not skeletally mature, and by some definitions (e.g., [57]) would not be considered an adult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, MOR 2919 is considered an adult, and a fully skeletally mature specimen with an EFS would be considered a senescent adult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MOR 794, a large adult Brachylophosaurus canadensis, is similar to MOR 2919 in that it also has not yet deposited an EFS (Fig 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LAGs in the outermost cortex of the femur of MOR 794 are more widely spaced than those of MOR 2919; the outermost 3 mm of the femur of MOR 794 contain only one LAG, whereas the outermost 3 mm of the tibia of MOR 2919 contain five LAGs (Fig 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, MOR 2919, with its smaller nasal crest, is at a slightly later ontogenetic stage than MOR 794, and so MOR 2919 cannot represent an immature stage of Brachylophosaurus canadensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ontogeny is intimately tied to evolution, as in a very general sense, ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny [58, 59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is often expressed in juvenile dinosaurs, which may bear morphologic traits of their adult ancestors (peramorphy) that are not expressed in the adults of the later taxon, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  juvenile Bactrosaurus dentition resembling that of iguanodonts [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because juveniles may retain ancestral characteristics, without proper stratigraphic data they may be mistaken as older, more basal taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, when juvenile specimens are coded into a phylogenetic matrix, they are placed more basally on the resulting cladogram than are adults of that taxon [61, 62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within hadrosaurine and lambeosaurine skulls, the most drastic ontogenetic changes occur in the morphology of the premaxillae, nasals, and supraoccipitals [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the individual grows, its premaxillae and nasals generally enlarge and change shape to form the crest [63], with the crest typically moving posteriorly during ontogeny [38, 64].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bones far from the incipient crest (quadrates, dentaries, and maxillae) change the least [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of tooth rows increases [37, 38], articular surfaces become more rugose, and the relative size of the orbit decreases [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These general trends are observed in both Probrachylophosaurus and Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nasal crest of Brachylophosaurus canadensis enlarges late in ontogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prieto-MÃ¡rquez [1] separated Brachylophosaurus specimens into slender and robust morphotypes, and stated that these individuals were approximately the same size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although specimens of the two morphotypes have roughly the same interorbital and postorbital widths [1, 23], these widths have been affected by diagenetic compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robust specimen MOR 794 is laterally compressed, decreasing its cranial width; the slender specimens MOR 1071-7-7-98-86 and MOR 1071-7-16-98-248 are dorsoventrally compressed, increasing their cranial widths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although their apparent sizes are similar, after accounting for differential compression slender Brachylophosaurus specimens are slightly smaller than robust specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slender and robust Brachylophosaurus specimens are both found in nearly the same horizons at Malta, Montana, and are therefore most parsimoniously ontogenetic stages of the same species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cuthbertson and Holmes [23] noted that the slender and robust morphotypes are not discrete; Brachylophosaurus specimens such as FMNH PR 862 and TMP 1990.104.001 possess crests of intermediate sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of intermediate crest morphologies supports individual or ontogenetic variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, individual variation in body size could account for the presence of specimens with different crest sizes at similar body sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Like many dinosaur taxa, hadrosaurids reached nearly their full adult size relatively quickly, and then grew increasingly slowly for the rest of their lives [65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In modern animals such as cassowaries, the cranial crest grows rapidly late in ontogeny, often after the rate of skeletal growth has greatly slowed and the individual is nearly at full adult size [66].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A near-adult cassowary with a skull length of 165 mm possesses a small incipient crest, and after a mere 5 mm (3%) of additional growth in skull length, acquires a full adult casque that covers most of the dorsal skull.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pachycephalosaurus and Stegoceras juveniles have flat skulls, gaining their distinctive frontoparietal domes later in ontogeny [67, 68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Centrosaurine ceratopsids also developed their pronounced cranial ornamentation late in ontogeny [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nasal crests of slender and robust Brachylophosaurus follow this pattern of rapidly increasing crest size with a very small increase in overall skull size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Brachylophosaurus, the nasal crest elongates and flattens posteriorly ontogenetically, and the posterior margin of the nasofrontal suture migrates posteriorly as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MOR 2919, the nasofrontal suture is anteriorly placed as in a subadult Brachylophosaurus, and the nasal crest is shorter than that of any adult Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, MOR 2919 is not a subadult; in addition to its large size, the braincase elements and vertebral neural arches are completely fused externally, with most sutures obliterated, and histology confirms that MOR 2919 was nearing skeletal maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In slender adult Brachylophosaurus (MOR 1071), cranial sutures are still clearly defined, and sutures are still visible in the robust morphology of adult Brachylophosaurus (MOR 794).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all sutures of braincase elements of MOR 2919 are fused and nearly obliterated, the nasofrontal suture and internasal suture are disarticulated and show no indications of fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nasofrontal suture in Brachylophosaurus becomes more rugose ontogenetically, stabilizing the suture as the nasal crest grows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of nasofrontal fusion in MOR 2919 suggests that the nasal crest was still enlarging at time of death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The holotype of Brachylophosaurus goodwini (UCMP 130139) and MOR 2919 were both collected from the Kennedy Coulee area, but the Brachylophosaurus goodwini holotype was located stratigraphically lower in the coulee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, UCMP 130139 does not preserve the posterior nasals, which are a critical character in defining Probrachylophosaurus bergei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UCMP 130139 is adult-sized, and its frontals exhibit an anteriorly-located nasofrontal suture that does not cover the entire frontals, similar to that of MOR 2919 and subadult Brachylophosaurus canadensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This supports UCMP 130139 and MOR 2919 being more closely related than either is to B. canadensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, UCMP 130139 exhibits anomalously deep frontal depressions that preclude it from being referred to P. bergei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the deep frontal depressions are not pathologic, taphonomic, diagenetic, or individual variation, then they may potentially be used as an autapomorphy to resurrect the species B. goodwini, although it will need a different genus name.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the poor preservational condition of the frontals of UCMP 130139, the specimen should be referred to Brachylophosaurini indet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pending additional specimens with similar frontal depressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The morphologies of elements of Probrachylophosaurus are consistently more similar to members of Brachylophosaurini than to other hadrosaurids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within Brachylophosaurini, elements of Probrachylophosaurus are either most similar to Brachylophosaurus or Acristavus, or intermediate between these taxa, as predicted by their relative stratigraphic positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This supports the hypothesis of Probrachylophosaurus bergei representing an intermediate taxon within the Acristavus-Brachylophosaurus lineage (Fig 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Probrachylophosaurus bergei gen. et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. is proposed as an intermediate member of the lineage leading from Acristavus gagslarsoni to Brachylophosaurus canadensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shaded blue areas indicate known elements of Probrachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skull outlines of Acristavus and Brachylophosaurus are used courtesy of Terry A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconstruction of the MOR 1071 Brachylophosaurus skull is a composite of an articulated skull roof with a scaled-down copy of the MOR 794 skull outline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All skulls are scaled to the same 10 cm scale bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The horizontal axis is not to scale; the MOR 1071 reconstruction is much closer to MOR 794 in size and hypothesized maturity than MOR 1097 is to MOR 2919.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiometric ages have been recalibrated to the Fish Canyon sanidine standard (28.305 +/- 0.036 Ma) of Renne et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10] from the originally published values [3, 1113]; see text and Table 1 for further recalibration details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The age of the Acristavus holotype was precisely estimated by Gates et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The age of the Comrey Sandstone Zone of the Oldman Formation is not tightly constrained, leading to uncertainty in the exact age of Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In some morphologic characters within Brachylophosaurini, the subadult morphology of the stratigraphically younger taxon matches the adult condition of the stratigraphically older taxon, illustrating a peramorphic trend of immature animals of a descendant taxon resembling adults of the ancestral taxon [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The palatine process of the jugal in subadult Probrachylophosaurus resembles the condition of adult Acristavus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nasal crest in Brachylophosaurus increases in size late in ontogeny: subadults lack any crest, similar to the adult form of their proposed ancestor Acristavus; small adults have a small crest reminiscent of their proposed ancestor Probrachylophosaurus; and large adults have a large broad paddle-shaped crest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nasofrontal suture of small subadult Brachylophosaurus is similar to that of adult Probrachylophosaurus, although Probrachylophosaurus has the deep rugosities of a more mature suture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prequadratic process of the squamosal of small subadult Brachylophosaurus is also more similar to that of adult Probrachylophosaurus than to adult Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Probrachylophosaurus bergei shares many morphologic similarities with Brachylophosaurus canadensis, but in other characters is more similar to Acristavus gagslarsoni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, placing P. bergei as merely a new species of either genus would be problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the cladistic matrix used, P. bergei may be the sister taxon to B. canadensis and could be classified as a member of the same genus (Fig 23), or Maiasaura peeblesorum may be the sister taxon to B. canadensis (Fig 22), requiring P. bergei to be classified as a separate genus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this phylogenetic uncertainty, Probrachylophosaurus bergei should be considered a unique genus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future discoveries of additional intermediate specimens will hopefully clarify evolutionary relationships within the Brachylophosaurini clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the early years of dinosaur paleontology, specimens were collected as isolated points, each so morphologically unique that their evolutionary relationships were difficult to determine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As more fossil specimens are collected, the gaps in morphology that previously separated species are being filled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With larger sample sizes resulting in more continuous series of fossils with good stratigraphic resolution, variations in morphology can be analyzed in a more complete context, and attributed to ontogeny, evolution, taphonomic alteration, biogeography, or individual variation [70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A better understanding of stratigraphy and advancements in radiometric dating enable precise temporal correlation of geographically separated localities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taxa can then be placed in temporal sequence, allowing tests of evolutionary hypotheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A precise stratigraphic framework is critical for determining whether morphological variations of adult specimens are due to evolution or are variations within a roughly contemporaneous population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If closely related taxa do not overlap stratigraphically, the pattern is more parsimonious with anagenesis than cladogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent research has greatly increased the sample size and stratigraphic resolution of specimens from the Judith River and Hell Creek Formations of Montana and their Canadian equivalents, revealing several potential anagenetic lineages in Campanian and Maastrichtian ornithischians [7, 45, 7173].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because Probrachylophosaurus bergei is stratigraphically older than all Brachylophosaurus canadensis specimens, it is hypothesized to represent a basal brachylophosaur morphology, early in the evolution of this lineage from a non-crested ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the small crest of Probrachylophosaurus would represent a transitional nasal morphology between a non-crested ancestor such as Acristavus and the larger crests of adult Brachylophosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth member of Brachylophosaurini, Maiasaura, would represent a cladogenic event, diverging from the lineage that led to Brachylophosaurus at a currently unknown point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
