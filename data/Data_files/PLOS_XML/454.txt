A Basal Lithostrotian Titanosaur (Dinosauria: Sauropoda) with a Complete Skull: Implications for the Evolution and Paleobiology of Titanosauria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We describe Sarmientosaurus musacchioi gen. et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., a titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous (CenomanianTuronian) Lower Member of the Bajo Barreal Formation of southern Chubut Province in central Patagonia, Argentina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotypic and only known specimen consists of an articulated, virtually complete skull and part of the cranial and middle cervical series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sarmientosaurus exhibits the following distinctive features that we interpret as autapomorphies: (1) maximum diameter of orbit nearly 40% rostrocaudal length of cranium; (2) complex maxillalacrimal articulation, in which the lacrimal clasps the ascending ramus of the maxilla; (3) medial edge of caudal sector of maxillary ascending ramus bordering bony nasal aperture with low but distinct ridge; (4) tongue-like ventral process of quadratojugal that overlaps quadrate caudally; (5) separate foramina for all three branches of the trigeminal nerve; (6) absence of median venous canal connecting infundibular region to ventral part of brainstem; (7) subvertical premaxillary, procumbent maxillary, and recumbent dentary teeth; (8) cervical vertebrae with strut-like centroprezygapophyseal laminae; (9) extremely elongate and slender ossified tendon positioned ventrolateral to cervical vertebrae and ribs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cranial endocast of Sarmientosaurus preserves some of the most complete information obtained to date regarding the brain and sensory systems of sauropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analysis recovers the new taxon as a basal member of Lithostrotia, as the most plesiomorphic titanosaurian to be preserved with a complete skull.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sarmientosaurus provides a wealth of new cranial evidence that reaffirms the close relationship of titanosaurs to Brachiosauridae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the presence of the relatively derived lithostrotian Tapuiasaurus in Aptian deposits indicates that the new Patagonian genus represents a ghost lineage with a comparatively plesiomorphic craniodental form, the evolutionary history of which is missing for at least 13 million years of the Cretaceous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skull anatomy of Sarmientosaurus suggests that multiple titanosaurian species with dissimilar cranial structures coexisted in the early Late Cretaceous of southern South America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the new taxon possesses a number of distinctive morphologiessuch as the ossified cervical tendon, extremely pneumatized cervical vertebrae, and a habitually downward-facing snoutthat have rarely, if ever, been documented in other titanosaurs, thus broadening our understanding of the anatomical diversity of this remarkable sauropod clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter two features were convergently acquired by at least one penecontemporaneous diplodocoid, and may represent mutual specializations for consuming low-growing vegetation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Titanosaurian sauropod dinosaurs were extremely diverse and abundant in Upper Cretaceous continental paleoenvironments in the Gondwanan landmasses, and have been discovered throughout the world [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titanosauria currently includes more than 60 genera and is most abundantly represented in South America, particularly in Argentina [4,5,7,8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most currently recognized titanosaurian taxa are represented exclusively or almost exclusively by postcranial bones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the years since Huene [9] described the incomplete craniomandibular remains of the Patagonian titanosaur Antarctosaurus wichmannianus (hereafter Antarctosaurus, since A. wichmannianus is the only species of this genus mentioned herein), discoveries of well-preserved titanosaurian skulls have been extraordinarily rare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, complete or nearly complete skulls are known only for the following taxa: Nemegtosaurus, from the Upper Cretaceous Nemegt Formation of Mongolia [10,11]; Rapetosaurus, from the Upper Cretaceous Maevarano Formation of Madagascar [12,13]; and Tapuiasaurus, from the Lower Cretaceous Quiricó Formation of Brazil [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tapuiasaurus was recovered from Aptian strata, whereas Nemegtosaurus and Rapetosaurus come from Maastrichtian deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, several complete or nearly complete but distorted skulls of generically unidentified embryonic titanosaurs are known from the Campanian Anacleto Formation at the Auca Mahuevo locality in northern Patagonia, Argentina [15,16,17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fragmentary skulls or isolated skull elements are also known for a number of titanosaurs or possible titanosaurs, in addition to Antarctosaurus: Ampelosaurus atacis [18], Ampelosaurus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [19], Bonatitan [2022], Bonitasaura [23,24], Brasilotitan [25], Campylodoniscus [9], Dreadnoughtus [26], Isisaurus [2730], Jainosaurus [28,30,31], Karongasaurus [32], Ligabuesaurus [33], Lirainosaurus [34,35], Malawisaurus [32], Maxakalisaurus [36], Mongolosaurus [37,38], Muyelensaurus [39], Narambuenatitan [40], Phuwiangosaurus [41], Pitekunsaurus [42], Quaesitosaurus [11,43], Quetecsaurus [44], Rinconsaurus [45], Saltasaurus [7,46], Tambatitanis [47], and Vahiny [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated, generically indeterminate titanosaurian cranial and mandibular elements have also been reported [7,9,21,31, 4964].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, complete or even reasonably complete titanosaur skulls remain unknown from the AlbianSantonian (a roughly 30 million year span of the mid- and Late Cretaceous; see Walker et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [65]), which represents a significant impediment to understanding of titanosaur cranial anatomy and evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we describe a new and plesiomorphic early Late Cretaceous (CenomanianTuronian) titanosaurian sauropod represented by a superbly-preserved adult skull articulated with a partial cervical series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The taxon provides a wealth of new information on the early evolution of Titanosauria and the cranial anatomy of basal members of the clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cranium and mandible are only slightly deformed, with most bones fully articulated and all teeth preserved in situ; as such, the new form is one of the very few titanosaurs for which the totality of this anatomical information is available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the unusual anatomy of the cervical series provides novel data on the construction of the neck and tendon system of a Cretaceous sauropod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The new titanosaur comes from an exposure of the Lower Member of the Upper Cretaceous Bajo Barreal Formation on the Estancia Laguna Palacios near the village of Buen Pasto in south-central Chubut Province, central Patagonia, Argentina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bajo Barreal Formation has produced a diverse continental vertebrate fauna that is among the richest of Patagonian dinosaur-bearing units [6675].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its outcrops are widely distributed in southern Chubut and northernmost Santa Cruz provinces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palynological data from a subsurface equivalent of the Bajo Barreal Formation, the Caleta Olivia Member of the Cañadón Seco Formation, initially suggested a late AlbianCenomanian age for these deposits [76].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, Bridge et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [77] reported ArAr radiometric dates from tuffs of the Bajo Barreal Formation that range in age from 95.8 to 91.0 Ma, corresponding to the middle Cenomanianmiddle Turonian of the current Geologic Time Scale [65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most recently, Suárez et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [78] obtained radiometric ages from zircons that further support a Cenomanian age for the Lower Member.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clyde et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [79] argued for a much younger (Campanian) age for the Bajo Barreal Formation on the basis of magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic evidence, but the strata they investigatedexposed in the regions of Lago Colhué Huapi and the Río Chico in southeastern Chubuthave recently been reassigned to a newly identified and significantly younger geologic unit (the Lago Colhué Huapi Formation [80]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted by Canale et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [81], the vertebrate fauna of the Bajo Barreal Formation is closely comparable to that of the lower Cenomanian [82] Candeleros Formation of the Neuquén Basin in northern Patagonia, suggesting that the two units may be correlative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The titanosaur was preserved in a green sandstone horizon that pertains to the upper part of the Lower Member of the Bajo Barreal Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This section of the Lower Member is lithologically characterized by these green sandstones, which were deposited in multiepisodic, interlaced fluvial channel systems [83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vast majority of the tetrapod fossils from the Bajo Barreal Formation have been recovered from these sandstones, which exhibit taphonomic and sedimentological properties that were conducive to vertebrate preservation [84].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skull and cervical series of the titanosaur were articulated and preserved in a fluvial overflow deposit with a high sedimentary load composed of medium-grained sandstones with abundant pelitic matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of articulation and lack of evidence of subaerial weathering of the specimen suggest that it was buried rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Description_and_Comparisons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cranium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cranium of Sarmientosaurus is 43 cm in length as measured from the rostral tip of the articulated premaxillae to the occipital condyle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is approximately 24 cm wide across the postorbitals and 24 cm tall from the dorsal margin of the frontal to the ventral end of the quadrate on the right side (see Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extreme fusion of many cranial bones, as in specimens of Ampelosaurus [18,19] and Saltasaurus [7,46], indicates that the specimen probably corresponds to a skeletally mature (and possibly very old) individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

External_Cranial_Fenestrae  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the cranium of Sarmientosaurus, three large openings are clearly visible in lateral view: from rostral to caudal, these are the antorbital fenestra, the orbit, and the infratemporal fenestra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As preserved, the bony nasal apertures (= external nares of many paleontological works) open rostrodorsally in a confluent fenestra, as in Rapetosaurus; nevertheless, it appears that, in life, these openings would have been separated by a bony lamina formed by the premaxillae and nasals (the internarial bar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this structure has been mostly destroyed by taphonomic processes, the caudally-incomplete narial flange of the premaxillae and a broken rostral projection of the nasals attest to its former existence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ventral to the rostral end of each antorbital fenestra is a minute, poorly preserved opening that we interpret as the homolog of the preantorbital fenestra; this foramen is discussed further in of our description of the maxilla below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The antorbital fenestra of the new Patagonian taxon is small, and its long axis is aligned obliquely with respect to that of the skull.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is teardrop-shaped, with the wider, rounded terminus situated rostroventrally and the pointed end positioned caudodorsally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antorbital fenestra of Sarmientosaurus resembles that of the Jurassic brachiosaurid Giraffatitan [95] but differs from those of the basal macronarians Camarasaurus [96] and Europasaurus [97] and the Cretaceous titanosauriforms Abydosaurus [98] and Euhelopus [99101], which are oriented more vertically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fenestra of Sarmientosaurus also differs from those of Nemegtosaurus [10,11] and Tapuiasaurus [14], which are larger, and especially that of Rapetosaurus, which is extremely large and rostrocaudally elongate [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A greatly enlarged antorbital fenestra also appears to be present in an isolated sauropod (presumably titanosaurian [102]) maxilla from the Maastrichtian Lameta Formation of India (ISI R K 27/528; see Huene and Matley [31]:fig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shape of the rostral edge of the lacrimal of the Late Cretaceous titanosaur Bonitasaura indicates that the caudodorsal margin of the antorbital fenestra was smoothly rounded in this taxon [24] rather than sharply acute as in Sarmientosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antorbital fenestra of the new Patagonian taxon is oriented at an angle of approximately 45° relative to the rostrocaudal axis of the skull, comparable to the condition in Giraffatitan and that reconstructed for Bonitasaura.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The orbit of Sarmientosaurus is proportionally very large, rostroventrallycaudodorsally elongate, and rounded at its caudodorsal and rostroventral margins, with the caudodorsal end rostrocaudally longer than the rostroventral end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in many dinosaurs, the orbit is regionally divisible into a dorsal ocular portion (that housed the eyeball and its adnexa) and a ventral non-ocular portion that was occupied by various soft-tissues (e.g., adductor muscles, vessels, nerves).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orbit differs from those of Camarasaurus, Giraffatitan, Nemegtosaurus, Rapetosaurus, and Tapuiasaurus, which are smaller and shaped differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the orbit of Abydosaurus is also proportionally large, it is not as large as in the new Bajo Barreal titanosaur; furthermore, it is subtriangular rather than ovate in contour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The supratemporal fenestra is bordered caudally by a prominent flange (the transverse nuchal crest), and its long axis is oriented mediolaterally, as in Europasaurus, Giraffatitan, and Rapetosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The infratemporal fenestra is rostrocaudally narrow throughout its dorsoventral extent, and its long axis is oriented roughly parallel to that of the orbit, as in Nemegtosaurus and Tapuiasaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts the conditions in Abydosaurus, Camarasaurus, Euhelopus, and Giraffatitan, in which this fenestra is subtriangular and rostrocaudally wide, especially ventrally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dermal_Cranial_Bones  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Palatal_Complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The palatal region of the Sarmientosaurus holotype was partially damaged by erosion, mainly on its midline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vomers are incomplete, as is often the case in sauropod skulls [96], and parts of the palatines, ectopterygoids, and pterygoids are also missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Braincase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The braincase of Sarmientosaurus is preserved in natural articulation to the remainder of the cranium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some regions are in good condition, such as the supraoccipital, which is only slightly damaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The otoccipitals (fused exoccipitalopisthotic complexes), by contrast, are damaged laterally, having lost some of the paroccipital processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some areas of the surface of the laterosphenoidorbitosphenoid complex are weathered and obscured by sediment, and the basal tubera are eroded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the base of the occipital condyle is preserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this surficial damage, the internal structure of the endocranial cavity is well preserved, and is discussed below (see Cranial Endocast).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cranial_Endocast  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CT scan data of the Sarmientosaurus type specimen provided excellent discrimination of bone and matrix, allowing one of the most complete 3D reconstructions of endocranial anatomy yet produced for any sauropod (Fig 9; S1 Fig; S5 Movie).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cranial endocast, all cranial nerves, and the endosseous labyrinth were recovered from both sides of the specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate discussion, we will refer to the digital casts of structures as if they were the structures themselves (e.g., orbitocerebral vein versus digital cast of orbitocerebral vein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The endocast of Sarmientosaurus is in many ways intermediate between those of basal titanosauriforms such as Giraffatitan [95] and those of more derived titanosaurians [19,21,30,63], yet it also presents features not seen elsewhere in Sauropoda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viewed laterally, the endocast has the typical pontine flexure seen in other saurischians, which is intermediate between the more marked flexure of basal sauropods such as Spinophorosaurus [117] and non-titanosaurian macronarians such as Camarasaurus [118] and Giraffatitan [95] and the almost horizontal conformation (i.e., reduced pontine flexure) seen in more advanced titanosaurs such as Ampelosaurus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [19] and Jainosaurus [30] (Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two rostral swellings on the endocast represent the olfactory bulbs (Fig 9A and 9D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The olfactory tract in Sarmientosaurus is reduced relative to that of Giraffatitan, which probably reflects differences in skull morphology (e.g., in the size and position of the nasal cavity, orbit, and adductor chamber) rather than significant differences in neurology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caudal to the olfactory bulbs and tracts is the region housing the cerebral hemispheres, which must have been modest in size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Details of the cerebrum and other brain regions are obscured by the overlying network of dural venous sinuses, which, as in other sauropods, are extensive (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsally, there is a large rostral dural expansion [118] similar to that of Giraffatitan [95].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In advanced titanosaurs [19,21,30], the rostral dural expansion tends to be comparatively reduced and less globular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Sarmientosaurus, it is continuous with a prominent swelling that courses ventrolaterally to terminate at the orbitocerebral vein, representing an anastomosis between the encephalic and orbital (ophthalmic) veins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These relationships suggest that this swelling likely represents the cerebrotectal (= sphenoparietal) venous sinus (Fig 9), which in extant archosaurs passes between the cerebrum and optic tectum (= optic lobe [118]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The endocast is constricted caudal to the cerebrum by the medial pillars of the laterosphenoid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optic tectum likely resided in this region, since, in extant sauropsids, the optic tectum is approximately bounded by the cerebrotectal sinus and transverse sinus system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caudal to this constriction, there is a straight, ridge-like feature of the endocast between the laterosphenoid and prootic, representing the transverse sinus (= middle cerebral) venous system, as in some derived titanosaurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transversotrigeminal (= rostral middle cerebral) vein exits the endocranium at the lateral terminus of the transverse sinus in association with the trigeminal nerve, as in other sauropods [95,117,118] and sauropsids more generally [121,125129].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the right side, the transversotrigeminal vein has two trunks that externally unite in a common foramen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transverse sinus is continuous dorsally with the caudal dural expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expansion in Sarmientosaurus resembles that of Camarasaurus [118] and Giraffatitan [95] in being relatively large, transversely expanded, and flared dorsolaterally, such that it is separated from the rostral dural expansion by a marked saddle (Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This condition is variable in other titanosaurs, in which the caudal dural expansion is sometimes more rounded dorsally [21] rather than flared dorsolaterally [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Sarmientosaurus, the caudal dural expansion receives a short median venous channel (presenting the appearance of a triangular spike on the endocast) that presumably was a diploic vein draining the supraoccipital bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither the rostral nor the caudal dural expansions seem to breach the skull roof dorsally (to form frontoparietal or postparietal foramina/fontanelles), although they are quite close, being roofed over only by relatively thin bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the presence of such frontoparietal and postparietal foramina/fontanelles is highly variable in sauropods, and some of these structures may even be preservational or preparation artifacts due to the loss of what is often very thin bone [95,118,130].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occipital dural venous sinus and the dorsal longitudinal sinus dominate the endocast caudal to the caudal dural expansion, obscuring the form of the cerebellum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cerebellum should reside more or less caudal to the transverse sinus [118], although, as noted, the shape of the cerebellum is not clearly represented by the endocast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a very slight expansion of the cerebellar region on both sides into the ring bounded by the rostral semicircular canal that might pertain to the floccular (= auricular) lobes of the cerebellum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Floccular lobes are present in a range of archosaurs [129,131133] but have rarely been identified in sauropods, with Nigersaurus [123] and potentially Giraffatitan [119] (L.M.W.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and R.C.R., unpublished data) being the only exceptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their presence in Sarmientosaurus, subtle though it may be, thus carries some significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ventrally, a large pituitary fossa is preserved, and is similar in size to that of other sauropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The infundibular region connecting the pituitary to the remainder of the endocranial cavity is relatively simple in that it lacks the peculiar caudal expansion observed in the Uzbekistan titanosaur [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sarmientosaurus also lacks the median canal (which is presumably venous in origin, a portion of the ventral longitudinal sinus [63]) connecting the infundibular region to the ventral part of the brainstem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This median canal often escapes notice, and has a patchy distribution in that it is present in Spinophorosaurus [117], Camarasaurus [118], and Giraffatitan (L.M.W.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and R.C.R., unpublished data), as well as the derived titanosaurs Bonatitan [21] and Jainosaurus (L.M.W.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and R.C.R., unpublished data) and the unnamed titanosaur from Uzbekistan [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, its absence in Sarmientosaurus would appear to be an apomorphy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pituitary fossa of the new Patagonian taxon resembles that of most sauropods in lacking a ventral median canal answering to the craniopharyngeal canal, whereas such a canal is present in the Uzbekistan titanosaur [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mandible  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When the holotype of Sarmientosaurus was discovered, the two mandibular rami were articulated to the cranium and to each other at the symphysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The somewhat eroded ventral margin of the mandible comprised most of the cranial bone that was visible in the outcrop (Fig 2A2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The right mandibular ramus (Figs 1416; S1 Fig; S6, S7 and S8 Movies) is nearly complete, preserved from the symphysis to the jaw joint, whereas the left (Figs 15 and 16; S1 Fig; S6, S7 and S8 Movies) is damaged, and the area caudal to the coronoid eminence is missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mandibular rami are relatively elongate and articulate rostrally at the symphysis, and they lack external mandibular fenestrae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  External mandibular fenestrae have, however, been reported in the Auca Mahuevo titanosaur embryos [1517] and in the skull of an undescribed titanosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of Rincón de los Sauces in northern Patagonia [138].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fenestra also appears to be present in Tapuiasaurus (see Zaher et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [14]:fig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Sarmientosaurus, the lateral surfaces of the mandibular rami are reasonably well preserved, although the surangular, angular, and symphyseal region are all damaged in the right ramus, and the latter area is slightly eroded in the left ramus as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, significant parts of the medial surfaces of both rami are fractured, cracked, and pitted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, only the Meckelian groove and the suture between the angular and prearticular are clear when externally examining the original fossil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our identifications of sutures between the other elements exposed on the medial side of the mandible are tentative and based largely on CT data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The U-shaped dorsal profile of the articulated mandible of Sarmientosaurus is shared with many sauropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, in many diplodocoids and the titanosaurs Bonitasaura [23,24], Brasilotitan [25], and Antarctosaurus [9], the mandible is rectangular, or nearly so, in dorsal view; among titanosaurs, this condition is particularly marked in the latter two genera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mandibular ramus of Sarmientosaurus preserves a total of six bones: the dentary, surangular, and angular, which are exposed both laterally and medially; and the splenial, prearticular, and coronoid, which are visible only in medial aspect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, most of the right articular appears to be present but fused to the prearticular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large adductor fossa is prominent in medial and caudal views.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mandible of Sarmientosaurus has two distinct and well-differentiated regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rostral region extends from the symphysis to the caudal end of the tooth row, and maintains a near-constant dorsoventral height throughout its length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts the dorsoventral symphyseal expansion of Antarctosaurus, Bonitasaura, Brasilotitan, Malawisaurus, Nemegtosaurus, Rapetosaurus, and Tapuiasaurus and the slight rostral increase in height in Europasaurus and Giraffatitan, and is similar to the morphology present in Abydosaurus; the rostral end of the mandible of the Rincón de los Sauces taxon is, however, described as very dorsoventrally low [138].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The caudal region begins just caudal to the tooth row; here, the mandible progressively expands up to the rostral end of the coronoid eminence, where it reaches its greatest height.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More caudally, it gradually narrows in dorsoventral dimension toward the articular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This narrowing is not as abrupt as that present in Camarasaurus, Nemegtosaurus, Quaesitosaurus, Rapetosaurus, Tapuiasaurus, and possibly Rinconsaurus (Calvo and González Riga [45]:pl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1b), nor as gradual as that in Euhelopus, but is comparable to the condition in Abydosaurus, Europasaurus, and Giraffatitan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dorsolateral margin of the dentary possesses a vertical lamina of bone that borders the tooth row, similar to but lower than the lamina of Nemegtosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dorsolateral and dorsomedial margins coalesce caudal to the tooth row, delineating a triangular dorsal concavity that points toward the adductor fossa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed in medial view, the mandibular symphysis is oriented almost perpendicular to the long axis of the mandible, as in Abydosaurus, Brasilotitan [25], Nemegtosaurus, and Quaesitosaurus [139].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Antarctosaurus (see Huene [9]:pl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29, fig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5c) and Malawisaurus (see Jacobs et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [102]:fig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1b; Gomani [32]:fig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7b), by contrast, the symphysis seems to be oriented more rostrodorsallycaudoventrally, presumably due to the ventral deflection (downturn) of the rostral end of the dentary in these taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symphysis of Sarmientosaurus is subrectangular in medial view, as in Antarctosaurus and Rapetosaurus, not medially convex (i.e., D-shaped or P-shaped) as it is in Bonitasaura [24] and Brasilotitan [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ventral edge of the mandibular ramus is markedly mediolaterally convex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mandibular articulation with the cranium is at a level ventral to the tooth row, as in other titanosauriforms [140].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dentition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The skull of Sarmientosaurus was discovered with the jaws closed and the premaxillary and maxillary teeth overlapping those of the dentary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the jaws were disarticulated, it became clear that the premaxillary teeth are subvertical, the maxillary teeth are procumbent (especially distally), and the dentary teeth are recumbent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there is no evidence that this unique condition is due to taphonomic distortion, we regard it as an autapomorphy of the new Patagonian titanosaur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, the preserved teeth and few empty alveoli indicate the following number of tooth positions: four in each premaxilla, 12 in the left maxilla and 11 in the right, and 13 in each dentary (see Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All known sauropods have four premaxillary teeth; however, the number of maxillary and dentary tooth positions in Sarmientosaurus is greater than in some other titanosaurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the undescribed skull from Rincón de los Sauces has only seven or eight maxillary teeth [138], and Rapetosaurus and Ampelosaurus atacis preserve 11 and nine dentary alveoli, respectively [13,18], though the only known dentary of the latter taxon appears to be rostromedially incomplete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maxillary and dentary tooth counts of the Auca Mahuevo embryosestimated at 78 and ten, respectivelyalso appear to be lower than those of Sarmientosaurus [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the dentary teeth of Antarctosaurus (15 or 16 [7,24]), Brasilotitan (14 [25]), and Malawisaurus (at least 15 [32,102]) are more numerous than in the new Patagonian taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within Titanosauria, the dental formula of Sarmientosaurus appears closest to those of Nemegtosaurus and Quaesitosaurus, which have four premaxillary, eight or nine maxillary, and 13 dentary teeth [10,11,43], though judging from Zaher et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ([14]:fig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) that of Tapuiasaurus may be even more similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dental formula of Sarmientosaurus is also very close to those of the titanosauriforms Euhelopus and Abydosaurus, which have four premaxillary, ten maxillary, and 13 and 14 dentary teeth, respectively [98,111].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The premaxillary teeth of Sarmientosaurus are larger than those of the maxilla and dentary (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the condition in some titanosaurs (e.g., Antarctosaurus, Brasilotitan, Dreadnoughtus [26], Petrobrasaurus [141]), all tooth crowns are elliptical rather than subcircular or oval in cross section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are compressed cone-chisel-shaped (sensu Calvo [140]) with high-angled wear facets, as in many titanosaurs; their Slenderness Index (sensu Upchurch [142]) is intermediate between those of the spatulate teeth typical of many sauropods and those of the elongate, pencil-shaped teeth characteristic of diplodocoids and multiple titanosaurs (e.g., Antarctosaurus, Bonitasaura, Brasilotitan, Dreadnoughtus, Karongasaurus, Lirainosaurus, Maxakalisaurus, Nemegtosaurus, Petrobrasaurus, Pitekunsaurus, Quaesitosaurus, Rapetosaurus, Rinconsaurus, Tapuiasaurus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crowns do not overlap one another as they do in Camarasaurus [140].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in Giraffatitan [143], the upper (i.e., premaxillary and maxillary) teeth exhibit much greater wear than the dentary teeth (Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We arbitrarily choose the first right maxillary tooth (Fig 18) to represent the morphology of the upper teeth of Sarmientosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general terms, their functional morphology is as has been described for other titanosauriform teeth, such as USNM 187535 from the Lower Cretaceous of Texas [144] and MPCA-Pv 96 from the Campanian of Río Negro, Argentina [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first right maxillary tooth has two wear facets situated at a high angle relative to the apicobasal axis of the tooth, one on the lingual surface and the other on the distal surface; the latter facet is essentially a continuation of the first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this tooth, these facets are of subequal size, but in other Sarmientosaurus upper teeth the distal facet is sometimes larger than the lingual facet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these wear facets, there is a low, apicobasally-oriented crest or bulge on the mesiolingual face of the crown that is delimited by two slight grooves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deeper and more distally positioned of these grooves extends along most of the length of the crown, whereas the shorter, shallower mesial groove reaches the apex of the lingual facet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  García and Cerda [61] interpreted the origin of the lingual wear facet in the upper teeth of titanosaurs as a result of contact of the lingual surface with the labial face of the lower teeth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These authors regarded the distal facet as a hallmark of a tooth that had erupted improperly, at an angle to its normal vertical axis, thereby contacting not only the labial or lingual faces of lower teeth (when the jaws were occluded) but also the mesial edge of the following upper tooth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some upper teeth of the Sarmientosaurus type specimen, such as the second left maxillary tooth and the fourth right premaxillary tooth, do not exhibit wear facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we infer that these teeth were not yet functional at the time of death of this individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain areas of the Sarmientosaurus jaws alternately house fully functional teeth and younger, barely functional or not yet functional teeth (Figs 36, 8 and 1316; S1 Fig; S1, S2, S3, S4, S6, S7 and S8 Movies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unsurprisingly, their wear patterns vary with the position of the tooth and the degree to which it was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The basal halves of the lower (i.e., dentary) tooth crowns (Fig 17B) are subcylindrical in cross section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the apical part of the lingual surface is gently excavated, rendering the crowns D-shaped in section here, as in Malawisaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lingual concavity is present in all preserved dentary teeth, but it is best developed in the largest, most mesially-positioned teeth, where it occupies most of the apical half of the crown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mesial and distal margins of each dentary tooth are subparallel throughout most of their extent but converge apically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apex slopes gently lingually and is marked by a diminutive, semicircular wear facet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the enamel of the lingual concavity is smooth, that of the subcylindrical basal area shows fine, longitudinally-oriented wrinkles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The labial surface is gently convex toward the apex, and its enamel is mostly smooth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a fine groove in the apical sector of the mesial margin; this area of the distal margin is occupied by a more prominent wear facet with oblique borders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The general conformation of the lower teeth of Sarmientosaurus is reminiscent of, though slightly taller-crowned than, those of Abydosaurus [98].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical tooth of this morphology, the fifth right dentary tooth (Fig 19), has a lingual groove that borders the mesial surface and a well-developed distolingual wear facet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lingual groove is in the concave part of the crown, and is lanceolate in shape with the point directed apically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is arranged in two planes: an apical plane that is small and relatively flat with a pair of diminutive marks, and a basal plane that is rectangular and comparatively deep with several longitudinal rugosities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distolingual facet is a long, deep groove that was produced by contact with the corresponding maxillary tooth (Fig 19D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In sum, the upper teeth of Sarmientosaurus have two contiguous wear facetslingual and distaland grooves near the mesial margin, whereas the lower teeth are subcylindrical basally but lingually concave more apically, and possess a mesial or nearly mesial groove, a deep distal wear facet, and a smaller apical wear facet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This array of tooth morphologies forms a combination that has apparently never previously been documented within Macronaria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A functional explanation for these features may be proposed following the criteria of García and Cerda [61], who emphasized the mutual and complex interrelationships between the upper and lower teeth at different growth stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Sarmientosaurus, however, we must also consider the consequences of the fact that the opposing teeth are oriented differently: subvertical in the premaxilla and the rostral end of the maxilla, markedly procumbent in the caudal part of the maxilla, and recumbent in the dentary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps this complex dental arrangement explains the unique combination of wear facets observed in the upper and lower teeth of this new titanosaur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of heavy wear on the upper teeth and only small apical facets on the dentary crowns demonstrates that, as in Giraffatitan [140,143], there was no tooth-to-tooth contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the distal wear facet of the lower crowns demonstrates the existence of the interlocked or interdigitated dental contact proposed by Calvo [145] for the titanosauriform Asiatosaurus [146].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Slenderness Index (SI), which is the ratio between the apicobasal height and the mesiodistal width of a given tooth crown [142], has been proposed to separate wide-crowned sauropods (e.g., Camarasaurus, Euhelopus, Jobaria) from their narrow-crowned counterparts (e.g., diplodocoids, many titanosaurs, e.g., Nemegtosaurus, Rapetosaurus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upchurch [142] proposed that an SI of less than 3 corresponds to the wide-crowned group and an SI of approximately 4 or more to the narrow-crowned group, whereas Curry [147] regarded wide-crowned sauropods as those with an SI of less than 4 and narrow-crowned taxa as those with a value higher than 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This index varies in Sarmientosaurus: of six complete, representative teeth in the right upper row, four have an SI of greater than 3 whereas the remaining two do not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also calculated the SI of three teeth in the left upper row, which is more than 3 in each of these cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the four right dentary teeth we examined in this fashion, all have SI values of 3 or more, and of four left dentary teeth, three have an SI of more than 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values suggest that the crowns of Sarmientosaurus, like those of the basal lithostrotian titanosaur Malawisaurus [32,102], record an intermediate stage between the spatulate teeth of basal macronarians such as Camarasaurus or relatively broad-crowned titanosaurs such as Ampelosaurus atacis [18,148] and the peg-like teeth of derived titanosaurians (e.g., Antarctosaurus, Bonitasaura, Nemegtosaurus, Rapetosaurus, Tapuiasaurus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cervical_Series  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The type specimen of Sarmientosaurus preserves parts of the cranial and middle cervical series, including the partial axis and a piece of its right rib articulated to the cranial end of the third cervical vertebra, a fragment of the caudal end of the fifth cervical vertebra adhered to the sixth cervical vertebra and its articulated right rib, and the seventh cervical vertebra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae are somewhat distorted and damaged by erosion; of these, the sixth is in marginally better condition and therefore provides more information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the field, the right ventral side of the cervical series was exposed, whereas the left was missing or covered by sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The series was fully articulated to within a few centimeters of the skull, which was turned at an angle of nearly 90° relative to the craniocaudal axis of the neck.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although additional vertebrae were observed in situ and collected, only the aforementioned five could be recovered during laboratory preparation; the others were too damaged by weathering to be salvageable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the right ventrolateral area of the neck, a cylindrical structure 3 mm in diameter originated a few centimeters from the occipital region of the skull and coursed along several vertebral centra (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Situated ventrolateral to the preserved cervical ribs (i.e., above and lateral to the ribs in the field, since the cervical series was discovered with its ventral side up), this structure is regarded here as an ossified cervical tendon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our identification of the positions of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae is based on their location in the articulated cervical series as it appeared in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these vertebrae may be regarded as middle cervicals, given that the few titanosaurs for which the cervical series is completely represented possess between 13 (the unidentified Brazilian titanosaur informally known as Peirópolis Series A [7,153]) and 17 vertebrae (Rapetosaurus [154]) in this region of the skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Distinctive_Features_of_Sarmientosaurus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_Relationships  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the evolutionary relationships of Sarmientosaurus via two principal phylogenetic analyses, both of which entailed multiple iterations of analysis with TNT (Tree analysis using New Technology) v. 1.1 [175].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first principal analysis, we examined the interrelationships of 22 sauropod genera using the basal form Shunosaurus as an outgroup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ingroup taxa included Abydosaurus, Alamosaurus, Apatosaurus, Baurutitan, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, Epachthosaurus, Euhelopus, Giraffatitan, Jobaria, Malawisaurus, Nemegtosaurus, Neuquensaurus, Nigersaurus, Omeisaurus, Phuwiangosaurus, Rapetosaurus, Rocasaurus, Saltasaurus, Sarmientosaurus, Tapuiasaurus, and Trigonosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 337 characters (105 cranial, 232 postcranial) were compiled by the second author (M.C.L.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characters were drawn or modified from many previous analyses [2,7,12,22,24,34,39,44,88,90,103,115,124,142,156,176185], with a few of these [90,103,142,180] being the original sources of most characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-six characters (numbers 3, 6, 14, 18, 20, 35, 50, 58, 63, 70, 75, 83, 90, 94, 98, 137, 160, 166, 200, 211, 212, 247, 254, 289, 290, and 322) were treated as ordered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The character list and data matrix are provided in the Supporting Information, as S1 and S2 Appendix, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The initial analysis (traditional [heuristic] search, 1,000 replicates of Wagner trees, random addition sequence, tree bisection reconnection branch swapping algorithm, ten trees saved per replicate) yielded three most parsimonious trees of 590 steps in length, the strict consensus of which has a Consistency Index (CI) of 0.55 and a Retention Index (RI) of 0.61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this consensus tree, Sarmientosaurus is placed in a derived position relative to Phuwiangosaurus, Euhelopus, and the basal lithostrotian titanosaur Malawisaurus, as the sister taxon of the more derived lithostrotians in the analysis, the most derived of which form an unresolved polytomy (Fig 29A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further investigate the phylogenetic relationships of Sarmientosaurus, we altered the dataset by adding the titanosaurs Bonitasaura and Opisthocoelica udia to the matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial analysis of this augmented matrix (S3 Appendix) yielded four most parsimonious trees of 613 steps, the strict consensus of which has a CI of 0.54 and an RI of 0.62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed position of Sarmientosaurus relative to other titanosaurs remained unchanged, though the topology among more derived members of Lithostrotia was slightly altered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In an effort to improve recovered phylogenetic resolution within Titanosauria, we removed 42 characters from the original matrix (characters 710, 12, 30, 37, 42, 44, 48, 58, 6062, 70, 72, 8790, 107, 108, 124, 126, 129, 131, 141, 147, 150, 157, 158, 160, 163, 164, 183, 184, 187, 193, 232, 269, 277, and 296), including many that had been optimized as synapomorphies of Neosauropoda in previous iterations of the analysis and others that were poorly informative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also added the Brazilian titanosaur Gondwanatitan [186] to the matrix, thus totaling 25 ingroup taxa and 295 characters (S4 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis yielded 32 most parsimonious trees of 536 steps, the strict consensus of which (Fig 29B) has a CI of 0.51 and an RI of 0.60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet again Sarmientosaurus is hypothesized as a lithostrotian more derived than Phuwiangosaurus, Euhelopus, and Malawisaurus (the latter two of which form a clade); in turn, the new Patagonian sauropod is proposed as the sister taxon of all other titanosaurs in the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second principal analysis was performed using the phylogenetic data matrix published by Zaher et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [14], which included an ingroup of 31 sauropod genera and Theropoda plus Prosauropoda as an outgroup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ingroup genera included Alamosaurus, Amargasaurus, Apatosaurus, Barapasaurus, Barosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diamantinasaurus, Dicraeosaurus, Diplodocus, Euhelopus, Giraffatitan, Haplocanthosaurus, Isisaurus, Jobaria, Malawisaurus, Mamenchisaurus, Nemegtosaurus, Neuquensaurus, Nigersaurus, Omeisaurus, Opisthocoelicaudia, Patagosaurus, Phuwiangosaurus, Rapetosaurus, Rayososaurus, Rebbachisaurus, Saltasaurus, Shunosaurus, Tangvayosaurus, Tapuiasaurus, and Vulcanodon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To these, we added Sarmientosaurus and Epachthosaurus, both of which are known from CenomanianTuronian strata of the Lower Member of the Bajo Barreal Formation in central Patagonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The matrix (S5 Appendix) included 246 characters (241 unordered, five [numbers 8, 37, 64, 66, and 198] ordered), 88 of which were cranial and the remaining 158 postcranial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our initial analytical trial yielded 20 most parsimonious trees of 472 steps, the strict consensus of which has a CI of 0.56 and an RI of 0.75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this tree, Sarmientosaurus is again hypothesized as a basal lithostrotian titanosaur, more derived than Phuwiangosaurus, Tangvayosaurus, and Malawisaurus and the sister group of the other lithostrotians in the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then eliminated nine ingroup taxa that are represented by fragmentary fossils and/or not thought to be closely related to Sarmientosaurus (Barapasaurus, Barosaurus, Diamantinasaurus, Dicraeosaurus, Haplocanthosaurus, Isisaurus, Rayososaurus, Rebbachisaurus, and Tangvayosaurus) and conducted a second iteration of the analysis (S6 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trial recovered seven most parsimonious trees of 434 steps, the strict consensus of which (Fig 29C) has a CI of 0.61 and an RI of 0.76.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once again, Sarmientosaurus is postulated as a basal lithostrotian titanosaur, more derived than Phuwiangosaurus and Malawisaurus but more basal than other Lithostrotia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we added the North American Early Cretaceous titanosauriform Abydosaurus to this reduced matrix, to test its potential relationship to Sarmientosaurus (S7 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trial yielded 14 most parsimonious trees of 447 steps (CI = 0.59; RI = 0.74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strict consensus of these trees (Fig 29D) posits Abydosaurus as a member of Somphospondyli, in an unresolved polytomy with Euhelopus, Phuwiangosaurus, and Lithostrotia at the base of the clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once again, Sarmientosaurus is postulated as a basal lithostrotian titanosaur, more derived than Malawisaurus but more basal than all other lithostrotians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the new Patagonian taxon is always maintained in a considerably more basal position than is Epachthosaurus, which holds implications for the relationships of these taxa to one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Are_Sarmientosaurus_and_Epachthosaurus_the_Same_Taxon?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All known fossils of the titanosaurian sauropod Epachthosaurus were collected from a site approximately 100 km south of that which produced Sarmientosaurus, from strata of the Lower Member of the Bajo Barreal Formation that are closely comparable to (and possibly correlative with) those that yielded the latter sauropod [7,67,187,188].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regrettably, known specimens of Epachthosaurus and Sarmientosaurus do not preserve skeletal elements in common, and as such, the two taxa cannot be directly compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that both are titanosaurs from nearby sites in the same geological formation, it is reasonable to consider the possibility that they may represent the same taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As is the case for Sarmientosaurus (see above), Epachthosaurus has been frequently (though not universally) regarded as a basal titanosaurian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the results of our phylogenetic analysis suggest that Sarmientosaurus occupies a substantially more basal position within Lithostrotia than does Epachthosaurus, casting doubt on the possibility that the two forms could be synonymous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, however, at least conceivable that they might represent a single titanosaurian taxon in which the skull and neck are more morphologically conservative than the remainder of the skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another point that should be considered in this context is demonstrated in Table 5: titanosaurian sauropods are remarkably diverse in the CenomanianTuronian strata of the Lower Member of the Bajo Barreal Formation that produced Epachthosaurus and Sarmientosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these two forms, comparable levels of this formation exposed in northern Santa Cruz Province (Argentina) have yielded a third titanosaurian taxon, Drusilasaura [73], and slightly younger (TuronianConiacian; G.A.C., unpublished data) beds in southern Chubut have produced a fourth titanosaur, Elaltitan [7,106,189].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the locality in southern Chubut Province that yielded known material of Epachthosaurus (the Estancia Ocho Hermanos; see Martínez et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [67]) has also produced the following titanosaurian specimens from comparable levels of the Bajo Barreal Formation: (1) a series of caudal vertebrae similar in morphology to those of the basal titanosaurian Andesaurus (e.g., UNPSJB-PV 178 and 595 [51]; Fig 30A and 30B); (2) another partial caudal series (UNPSJB-PV 175, 176, 177, 876, and 877 [51]; Fig 30E) associated with two hemal arches and a fragmentary femur (UNPSJB-PV 172) of a taxon that is clearly distinct from Epachthosaurus [51] (Fig 30C and 30D); and (3) a left premaxilla (UNPSJB-PV 669 [51]) that is proportionally dorsoventrally taller and mediolaterally wider than those of Sarmientosaurus (Fig 31A and 31B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Sciutto and Martínez [53] described a titanosaurian left maxilla (UNPSJB-PV 583; Fig 31F and 31H) from a locality very close to that which yielded MDT-PV 2, and from an equivalent horizon of the Bajo Barreal Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This maxilla differs strongly from those of Sarmientosaurus in several features: (1) it is relatively rostrocaudally short and dorsoventrally tall; (2) it preserves the margin of the narial opening, which was clearly more rostrally placed than in Sarmientosaurus; (3) it has only eight alveoli (versus 1112 in Sarmientosaurus); and (4) its teeth are narrower-crowned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that at least one other titanosaur with a comparatively short and high skull coexisted with Sarmientosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The taxonomic situation involving Sarmientosaurus and Epachthosaurus is closely comparable to that between the titanosaurs Nemegtosaurus [10] and Opisthocoelicaudia [190] from the Upper Cretaceous Nemegt Formation of Mongolia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these Nemegt titanosaurs are currently considered valid, though the former is represented only by the skull and the latter only by postcrania.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As is the case for Sarmientosaurus and Epachthosaurus, definitively determining whether or not Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia belong to the same taxon will require the discovery of specimens that preserve an association of skeletal elements that are already known for both of these forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implications_of_Sarmientosaurus_for_Titanosauriform_Evolution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our cladistic analyses have consistently recovered Sarmientosaurus as an archaic lithostrotian titanosaur, phylogenetically basal to taxa such as Nemegtosaurus, Rapetosaurus, and Tapuiasaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phylogenetic position of the new Patagonian form relative to Tapuiasaurus is of particular interest given the respective geologic ages of these sauropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tapuiasaurus comes from Aptian (possibly early Aptian) strata in Brazil [14], whereas Sarmientosaurus is from CenomanianTuronian beds in southern Argentina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the current Geologic Time Scale [65], the Aptian extends from 126113 Ma and the CenomanianTuronian from 10089.8 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the comparatively derived Brazilian form is at least 13 million yearsand more probably some 25 million yearsolder than the new Argentinean titanosaur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The craniodental anatomies of these sauropods differ dramatically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sarmientosaurus retains a relatively plesiomorphic skull and wide-crowned dentition reminiscent of those of non-titanosaurian titanosauriforms such as Abydosaurus and Giraffatitan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tapuiasaurus, by contrast, closely resembles other derived titanosaurians in having a proportionally low and elongate skull with narrow-crowned teeth restricted to the rostral ends of the jaws.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of Sarmientosaurus in the CenomanianTuronian suggests that, in South America and perhaps elsewhere, comparatively short-skulled, broad-toothed titanosaurs persisted alongside their more advanced, diplodocoid-like relatives for tens of millions of years, at least into the early stages of the Late Cretaceous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disparate skull and tooth morphologies of these titanosaurs may well reflect distinct dietary preferences and/or feeding mechanisms; if so, the coexistence of these animals may have been facilitated by niche partitioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another notable aspect of our strict consensus trees is that, in contrast to several earlier studies [12,14,180], Rapetosaurus and Tapuiasaurus are never recovered as members of Nemegtosauridae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nemegtosauridae is defined as the stem-based clade that includes all titanosaurs more closely related to Nemegtosaurus than to Saltasaurus; apart from the former genus, the only other indisputable nemegtosaurid is Quaesitosaurus [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, until now, Nemegtosaurus, Rapetosaurus, and Tapuiasaurus were the only titanosaurians for which complete or nearly complete skulls had been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore suspect that the purported monophyly of these three genera has been an artifact of differential preservation among titanosaur taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stated simply, Nemegtosaurus, Rapetosaurus, and Tapuiasaurus have been artificially pulled together in previous analyses because they were the only titanosaurs for which most craniomandibular characters could be definitively scored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (DEmic [115]:644646] briefly discussed this phenomenon as it pertains to the phylogeny of Titanosauriformes more broadly, terming it the monophyly of the preserved.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incorporation of Sarmientosaurus into phylogenetic analyses has had the effect of redistributing craniomandibular character data throughout Titanosauria, such that many putative nemegtosaurid synapomorphies are now proposed to characterize wider taxonomic groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Wilson ([11]:313) predicted such an eventuality: As more well-preserved titanosaur skulls are discovered, the distribution of characters supporting nemegtosaurid monophyly will likely broaden to diagnose more inclusive groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lastly, an unexpected result of our phylogenetic analyses involves the Early Cretaceous North American titanosauriform Abydosaurus [98].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This taxon has been nested within Brachiosauridae in all previous analyses in which it has been included [98,115,124,159,191].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our strict consensus trees, however, Abydosaurus is always recovered as a basal titanosauriform that is closer to Titanosauria than to the only uncontroversial brachiosaurid in our matrices, Giraffatitan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that Abydosaurus may not be a member of Brachiosauridae, and that this clade (at least as it has been conceived by some recent authors [98,115,124]) may be paraphyletic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, Abydosaurus exhibits similarities with Sarmientosaurus: for instance, the orbit is proportionally large and the tooth count is closely comparable in both taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most notably, Abydosaurus and Sarmientosaurus share a foramen on the lateral surface of the postorbital, near the junction of the rostrodorsal, caudodorsal, and ventral processes, a condition that is presently unique to these genera, but that may also occur in other sauropods (L.M.W., unpublished data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of these morphologies should be investigated in future phylogenetic analyses of Titanosauriformes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the comprehensive description of the Abydosaurus material (especially the abundant postcranial remains [98]) will undoubtedly clarify the systematic position of this taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Feeding_Mechanism_of_Sarmientosaurus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The jaw mechanics of sauropods have been studied by numerous authors [140,143,192200].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is general consensus that, in these herbivorous dinosaurs, food was swallowed with little to no oral processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many works [192,201] have assumed the presence of a gastric mill that would have done much of the processing of ingested vegetation, although more recent studies [202] have cast considerable doubt on the existence of this type of structure in sauropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Calvo [140] argued that, in sauropods, dental microwear patterns provide evidence of the direction of jaw motion on the occlusal surfaces of the teeth, evidence that can, in turn, be evaluated by examining the mandibular joint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on his observations of titanosaur microwear and mandibular morphology, Calvo [140] proposed that these sauropods possessed a simple, up-down, orthal, isognathic jaw mechanism similar to that which he reconstructed for Giraffatitan but distinct from the propaliny he proposed for Diplodocus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Christiansen [143] examined the feeding mechanics of Giraffatitan, among other sauropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although he could not precisely determine the cropping mechanism that this titanosauriform would have employed, he proposed that Giraffatitan raked foliage from stems and branches in a fashion at least broadly comparable to that which he inferred for the diplodocoids Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He also argued that the dental wear pattern of this brachiosaurid does not indicate that it was produced by tooth-to-tooth contact, despite the occasional existence of apical wear facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, Christiansen [143] concurred with Calvo [140] in suggesting that Giraffatitan might also have utilized some form of shearing mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
García and Cerda [61] proposed a hypothesis to explain the formation of wear facets on teeth that exhibit these facets on both their labial and lingual surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These authors suggested that contact of the teeth with each other as well as with plant material produced these wear facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  García and Cerda [61] also argued that it is not possible to precisely reconstruct which plants a given sauropod might have eaten based solely on its dental microwear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the animal would have frequently (and presumably, inadvertently) ingested sediment along with the vegetation it consumed, and this sediment would also have produced microwear on its teeth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The premaxillary and maxillary teeth of Sarmientosaurus exhibit lingual and distal wear facets accompanied by slight, submesially-placed grooves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional dentary teeth do not have labial wear facets, but instead have strong distal wear facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These distal wear facets on the dentary teeth are not present in the sample of 185 titanosaurian teeth from a diversity of geological formations analyzed by García and Cerda [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Calvo [140,145] considered the teeth of the sauropod Asiatosaurus mongoliensis (widely regarded as a nomen dubium; [90,203,204]) to belong to Titanosauriformes due to the high angle of their wear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the two teeth of this taxon described by Osborn [146] have mesiodistal wear facets that imply interdigitated occlusion as in Camarasaurus [150].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calvo [140,145] regarded the jaw movements of Asiatosaurus to be orthal, as in titanosauriforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Sarmientosaurus, the prominent distal wear facet of the dentary teethwhich is oriented parallel to the long axis of the toothis correlated with the submesial groove of the upper teeth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates the existence of some degree of occlusal interdigitation, as present in the aforementioned macronarians but absent in advanced titanosaurians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the subvertical wear facets of its teeth and the general orientation of its dental microwear [113], the new Patagonian taxon would have employed orthal jaw movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The peculiar orientation of the tooth crowns of Sarmientosaurus is not observed in other sauropods, and its functional significance is therefore difficult to interpret.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the combination of subvertical premaxillary and mesial maxillary crowns and recumbent dentary crowns might indicate the existence of specialized shearing movements in the rostral part of the mouth that would have facilitated the slicing of plant matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Diet_of_Sarmientosaurus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In interpreting the diet of Sarmientosaurus, several factors must be considered, including the type of teeth present in the new sauropod, the paleoenvironmental and paleobotanical record of the time and place in which the animal lived, and what is known about its body structure and posture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ryan and Vickaryous [205] considered sauropods to be gut processors with simple teeth; assuming that this is the case, these dinosaurs must have had specialized intestines to digest fibrous, poorly nutritive plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As tools for slicing vegetation, the teeth of Sarmientosaurus formed the first phase of the digestive process of this titanosaur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When considering the diet of Sarmientosaurus, we must also take into account the probable habitual postures of the head and neck.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on several lines of anatomical evidence (e.g., the likely orientation of the snout in life, the morphology of the inner ear and cervical series), Sereno et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [123] envisioned the diplodocoid sauropods Diplodocus and Nigersaurus as low-height browsers when the neck was held in its neutral position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inferred orientation of the occipital condyle of Sarmientosaurus indicates that, as in these diplodocoids, the skull was habitually held with the snout pointing mostly downward relative to the craniocaudal axis of the neck.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconstructed anatomy of the semicircular canals supports this interpretation (see above) in that the alert posture of the head in Sarmientosaurusas determined by aligning the lateral semicircular canal with Earth horizontal (see Witmer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [118,132] and references therein)also indicates a strongly downturned head posture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as in Nigersaurus, the new Patagonian titanosaur had an extensively pneumatized cervical series (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these features suggest a habitually neutral neck position that would have restricted the diet of Sarmientosaurus to relatively low-growing plants, as Stevens and Parrish [122] have proposed for other sauropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stevens and Parrish [206] suggested three possible forms of browsing with a habitually neutral neck posture: by ventriflexion, dorsiflexion, or neutral browsing, but all of these hypothesized positions are based primarily on digital analyses of the necks of sauropods for which this part of the skeleton is well preserved, such as Apatosaurus and Diplodocus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, the incompletely known cervical series of Sarmientosaurus precludes conducting these types of analyses on the new titanosaur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we lack information on neck flexibility in Sarmientosaurus, and can only speculate on most of its relevant body dimensions (e.g., shoulder height).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stevens and Parrish [122,206] concluded that most sauropods were low- and medium-height browsers, but estimated that Diplodocus, for example, could feed up to four meters above the ground by virtue of its large body size and long neck.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As did Sereno et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [123] in the case of Nigersaurus, Parrish [207] argued that diplodocids and nemegtosaurid titanosaurswith their downwardly-angled heads, rostrally broad snouts, and rostrally-located teethwere adapted to browsing at low heights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though only the first of these features is present in Sarmientosaurus, it is, in our view, probable that the new titanosaur was primarily a low browser as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the comparatively robust nature of its teeth, it seems unlikely that Sarmientosaurus fed on soft vegetation, as has been proposed for Nigersaurus [123], but see [208].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stevens and Parrish [122] argued that titanosaurs, especially derived members of the clade, used their teeth to strip leaves from stems or slice vegetation (albeit softer vegetation than more basal macronarians such as Camarasaurus and Giraffatitan could process).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Cenomanian is widely considered as the interval when angiosperms began to dominate continental macrofloras, including those in Patagonia [209]; as such, it is likely that Sarmientosaurus regularly fed on some of these flowering plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oldest known records of Poales (grasses)a potential food for the new titanosaurare younger than the early Late Cretaceous [210], although it is possible that the group originated in Gondwana during the middle Cretaceous [211].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The paleobotanical record of the Lower Member of the Bajo Barreal Formation (the unit that yielded Sarmientosaurus) includes fossil wood of the araucarian conifer morphotype Agathoxylon [212] and pollen of the angiosperm genera Liliacidites, Nyssapollenites, Rousea, Tricolpites, and Verrutricolpites [76,213].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An early Late Cretaceous angiosperm leaf assemblage was recovered some 900 km to the south of the Sarmientosaurus locality, in strata of the CenomanianConiacian Mata Amarilla Formation of Santa Cruz Province [209].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This flora consists of a dozen morphotypes distributed in two depositional settings: a marine environment and a floodplain, the latter of which is comparable to the paleoenvironment reconstructed for the Lower Member of the Bajo Barreal Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with fern and conifer remains, these Mata Amarilla Formation strata have yielded fossil leaves consistent with the angiosperm genera Laurophyllum, Sterculia, Myrcia, and Peumus; the first two forms are suggestive of a subtropical, humid climate [214].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the geographic and stratigraphic proximity of the Bajo Barreal and Mata Amarilla formations, it is likely that Sarmientosaurus inhabited this type of paleoclimate as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by the morphology of the Agathoxylon wood from the Bajo Barreal Formation, which has weak growth rings that indicate a lack of significant climatic seasonality [212].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to angiosperms, plants such as gleicheniaceous ferns [215], horsetails, and cycads probably also contributed to the diet of the new titanosaur, as has been proposed for sauropods from other landmasses and temporal intervals [194,196,216222].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cervical_Pneumaticity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cervical vertebrae of Sarmientosaurus show the camellate, highly pneumatic internal structure characteristic of the presacral vertebrae of somphospondylan sauropods (Fig 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of pneumaticity in sauropod vertebrae has been documented by numerous workers [32,155,223229], but studies of axial pneumaticity in titanosaurs are relatively scarce [46,94,147,225,230,231].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wedel [225] regarded the extensive vertebral pneumaticity of various sauropod clades (including Titanosauria) as a specialization related to increased body mass and neck length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wedel [226] examined the extent of pneumaticity in different sauropods by calculating the Air Space Proportion (ASP) of transverse sections through vertebrae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He ([226]:table 7.2) estimated the average sauropod ASP at 50%60% air by measured volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We examined the pneumaticity of the preserved vertebrae of Sarmientosaurus via a CT-based analysis, using the methodology proposed by Wedel [226].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this analysis is the first of its kind yet performed on a titanosaurian cervical series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CT images revealed extraordinarily high ASP valuesup to 88.19% airin each axial cross section (see Table 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average ASP of the Sarmientosaurus axis and third cervical vertebra is 81.64%, whereas that of the sixth cervical vertebra is 70.56% and the seventh is 75.18%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower ASP values are generally observed in the articular condyles and cotyles of the centra; this is probably a consequence of biomechanical factors related to maintaining structural strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, a cervical vertebra of a juvenile individual of the non-titanosaurian somphospondylan or basal titanosaurian Phuwiangosaurus has a mid-centrum ASP of only 55% [165,226].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ASPs vary considerably in non-titanosaurian sauropods, the maximum recorded values for cervical centra are 74% at mid-centrum in the titanosauriform Sauroposeidon and 77% near the caudal cotyle in the diplodocid Tornieria ([219]:table 7.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sereno et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [123] reported extreme cervical vertebral pneumaticityprobably even greater than that of Sarmientosaurusin the African rebbachisaurid Nigersaurus, but did not calculate an ASP or comparable quantitative value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it is clear that the new Patagonian titanosaur possesses some of the most extensively pneumatized cervical centra yet documented within Sauropoda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When considering the paleobiological significance of the highly pneumatic cervical vertebrae of Sarmientosaurus, we should also take into account the other distinctive morphologies of the taxon, such as exceptionally elongate cervical vertebrae accompanied by ossified, ventrolaterally-positioned tendons, a downwardly-angled skull, and a habitually neutral or proportionally low neck posture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suite of features would have made the new titanosaur an efficient harvester of vegetation, probably from plants growing at medium to low heights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Nigersaurus also possesses the combination of an exceptionally pneumatized neck and a downward-facing snout [123]; nevertheless, the two forms differ considerably in that Sarmientosaurus has a much more robustly-constructed skull and teeth and (probably) a proportionally longer neck.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These shared cranial and cervical features of Nigersaurus and Sarmientosaurus represent a series of previously undocumented convergences between Diplodocoidea and Titanosauria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps not coincidentally, these two sauropod genera inhabited mid-Cretaceous paleoecosystems in the western Gondwanan continents (Afro-Arabia and South America, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the intriguing possibility that the convergent morphologies observed in these taxa may represent an adaptive response to some factor common to these paleoenvironments, perhaps the diversification and increasing dominance of angiosperms during the mid-Cretaceous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sarmientosaurus musacchioi is the first titanosaurian sauropod from southern South America for which an articulated, virtually complete adult skull has been discovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that the new taxon is an archaic member of the titanosaurian subclade Lithostrotia, occupying a position more derived than Malawisaurus but more basal than taxa frequently regarded as nemegtosaurids (Nemegtosaurus, Rapetosaurus, and Tapuiasaurus) and saltasaurid titanosaurs such as Alamosaurus, Neuquensaurus, and Saltasaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, Sarmientosaurus is the most basal known titanosaur to be represented by a well-preserved skull.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new taxon exhibits a previously-undocumented cranial form that consists of an amalgam of plesiomorphic titanosauriform features such as a comparatively broad snout with a large narial fossa and a deep mandibular adductor chamber with more derived morphologies such as an elongate rostral process of the prefrontal (Figs 33 and 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These characters offer novel cranial support for the phylogenetic hypothesis that titanosaurians are closely related to Brachiosauridae and other titanosauriformsa hypothesis that, although now well-established, had previously been based primarily on evidence from the postcranial skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the occurrence of the more derived lithostrotian Tapuiasaurus in the Aptian of Brazil raises the possibility that the new Patagonian taxon represents a titanosaurian ghost lineage, the evolutionary history of which remains undocumented for almost all of the mid-Cretaceous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Sarmientosaurus possesses a number of distinctive features that have not been observed in other sauropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cranial endocast presents among the most complete information about the brain and sensory systems for any sauropod, let alone titanosaurs, and thus will be important for the developing picture of neural evolution in Sauropoda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endocast and inner ear possess clear titanosaurian apomorphies, but also retain a number of plesiomorphies, supporting the hypothesized phylogenetic position of Sarmientosaurus as a basal member of Lithostrotia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dentition of the new Patagonian taxon is also unique in the disposition and morphology of its wear facets and the peculiar orientations of the upper and lower teeth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adaptive significance of the latter feature is currently unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a ventrolaterally-positioned ossified tendon in the neck of the new sauropod is an anatomical novelty within non-avian dinosaurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ossified tendons occur in numerous ornithischian taxa, but in these animals, the tendons are associated with the neural spines of the caudal dorsal, sacral, and proximal caudal vertebrae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other non-avian dinosaur exhibits ossified tendons situated ventrolateral to the cervical ribs, or tendons that maintain a constant, diminutive diameter over several meters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Sarmientosaurus provides key data on the extent of cervical pneumatization in titanosaurs, in having vertebrae that are internally comprised much more by air than by bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new Argentinean lithostrotian exhibits remarkable convergence to the diplodocoid Nigersaurus in this regard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the occurrence of Sarmientosaurus in the CenomanianTuronian Lower Member of the Bajo Barreal Formation underscores the significance of this geologic unit as an important source of information on non-avian dinosaur diversity and evolution during the early Late Cretaceous in southwestern Gondwana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 2 km from the Sarmientosaurus type locality, and from a stratigraphically equivalent horizon, earlier field efforts led by the senior author (R.D.F.M.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  recovered a titanosaurian left maxilla [53] that differs dramatically from that of the new taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, this isolated maxilla is rostrocaudally short and dorsoventrally tall, suggesting that the sauropod to which it pertained had a similarly short, high skull, unlike the relatively elongate skull of Sarmientosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, Powell et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [51] reported a titanosaurian left premaxilla, again from Bajo Barreal Formation strata at least approximately correlative to those that produced Sarmientosaurus, but from a more distant locality (the Estancia Ocho Hermanos in the Sierra de San Bernardo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This premaxilla contrasts with that of the new lithostrotian in being relatively tall and mediolaterally wide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these discoveries suggest that multiple titanosaurian lineages with disparate cranial morphologies coexisted in the CenomanianTuronian of central Patagonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps these distinct cranial specializations reflect different dietary preferences in these large herbivores; if so, then these sauropods may have able to coexist by partitioning their niches to exploit different types of vegetation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the angiosperm radiation was well underway by the early Late Cretaceous, these flowering plants were almost certainly a significant food source for Sarmientosaurus and other coeval titanosaurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, the new Patagonian sauropod provides critical insights into the cranial and cervical anatomy of basal members of Titanosauria, which in turn enhances our understanding of the evolutionary history and paleobiology of this extraordinarily diverse and abundant herbivorous dinosaur clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
