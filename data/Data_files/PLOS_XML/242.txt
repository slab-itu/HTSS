Standardized Assessment of Biodiversity Trends in Tropical Forest Protected Areas: The End Is Not in Sight  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extinction rates in the Anthropocene are three orders of magnitude higher than background and disproportionately occur in the tropics, home of half the worlds species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite global efforts to combat tropical species extinctions, lack of high-quality, objective information on tropical biodiversity has hampered quantitative evaluation of conservation strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the scarcity of population-level monitoring in tropical forests has stymied assessment of biodiversity outcomes, such as the status and trends of animal populations in protected areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we evaluate occupancy trends for 511 populations of terrestrial mammals and birds, representing 244 species from 15 tropical forest protected areas on three continents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the first time to our knowledge, we use annual surveys from tropical forests worldwide that employ a standardized camera trapping protocol, and we compute data analytics that correct for imperfect detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that occupancy declined in 22%, increased in 17%, and exhibited no change in 22% of populations during the last 38 years, while 39% of populations were detected too infrequently to assess occupancy changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite extensive variability in occupancy trends, these 15 tropical protected areas have not exhibited systematic declines in biodiversity (i.e., occupancy, richness, or evenness) at the community level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results differ from reports of widespread biodiversity declines based on aggregated secondary data and expert opinion and suggest less extreme deterioration in tropical forest protected areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simultaneously fill an important conservation data gap and demonstrate the value of large-scale monitoring infrastructure and powerful analytics, which can be scaled to incorporate additional sites, ecosystems, and monitoring methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an era of catastrophic biodiversity loss, robust indicators produced from standardized monitoring infrastructure are critical to accurately assess population outcomes and identify conservation strategies that can avert biodiversity collapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Humans are currently driving numerous animal species toward extinction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species loss is especially high in tropical regions where most species live and where biodiversity threats are severe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protected areas such as national parks are the cornerstone of species conservation, but whether protected areas really sustain animal populations and prevent extinction has been debated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This applies particularly to understudied areas such as tropical forests, for which high-quality data are usually not available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used camera traps to monitor populations of ground-dwelling mammals and birds in 15 protected tropical forests around the world and then used powerful analytics to determine their population trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that some animal populations increased while others decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the number and distribution of species in these areas did not decline during the 38 years we examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are more optimistic about the success of protected areas than were previous studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrates the importance of standardized monitoring for conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rates of human population growth are among the highest in the tropics, and natural resource-based economies in many developing countries subject tropical landscapes to rapid rates of land conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, defaunationanimal loss ranging from local population decline to species extinction [1]is most extreme in the tropics [1,2], with projected land-use changes expected to cause widespread loss of biodiversity [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tropical mammals and birds, and the primary forests that support them, are essential [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their loss can prompt cascading effects throughout ecosystems [5,6], with empty forest syndrome [7] negatively affecting ecological function and human wellbeing [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to the biodiversity crisis, nearly two hundred nations have committed to increase coverage of effective protected areas, prevent extinctions of threatened species, and improve the status of species in decline by 2020 under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi Biodiversity Targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two key information challenges inhibit progress on achieving Aichi Targets 11 (Protected Areas) and 12 (Preventing Extinctions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first challenge is the significant disparity in the amount of tropical biodiversity data that exists in comparison with higher latitude regions [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of the disparity is compounded by the fact that species richness is highest in the tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This data void prevents rigorous evaluation of tropical species responses to threats, which precludes targeted conservation efforts [10,11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second challenge is the quality of available biodiversity data in the tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, there is a lack of primary in situ data on populations in tropical protected areas [12], which results in conclusions based on aggregated secondary data and expert opinion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the most comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of tropical forest protected areas was largely based on expert opinion and suggested that many parks were failing [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gravity of conservation decisions necessitates more objective evaluations using primary data and robust indicators of biodiversity change [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Camera traps that photograph animals as they pass by sensors allow for noninvasive surveys in even the most remote places.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring Network (TEAM), established in 2002 to help fill the tropical data void, uses large-scale arrays of camera traps to systematically monitor terrestrial (i.e., ground-dwelling) mammals and birds in tropical protected areas on an annual basis (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEAM includes 17 sites, 15 of which have three or more years of camera trap data (Fig 1 and S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined, the surveys produce approximately 500,000 images per year and sample over 3,200 km2 to inform management of more than 61,000 km2 of protected areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEAM currently monitors 511 populations from 244 ground-dwelling vertebrate species, which include 41 Threatened (TH), 25 Near Threatened (NT), 169 Least Concern (LC), and nine Data Deficient (DD) species (S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate populations via an extensive data collection infrastructure, TEAM uses occupancy analyses that correct for detection probability, as well as the Wildlife Picture Index (WPI), a robust biodiversity indicator developed for camera-trap data and designed to evaluate composite biodiversity trends by being sensitive to changes in species occupancy, richness, and evenness (Methods) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trends in occupancy for mammal and bird species in 15 tropical protected areas assessed with standardized surveys using camera traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of populations with unknown, decreasing, stable, or increasing occupancy is shown for each site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The type of landscape is indicated by marker color, and the number of years of camera trap data is indicated inside the square marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Green shading depicts tropical forest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See S1 and S2 Tables for numerical data and information corresponding to 3-letter site codes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002357.g002  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Occupancy is the estimated probability of a species occurrence at a site [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the relationship between abundance and occupancy is not linear [16,17], empirical studies have documented a correlation in field settings [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, occupancy is an indicator of abundance, and provides information on both abundance and extinction likelihood [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the rarity of most tropical mammal and bird species, detections generally are too infrequent to adequately estimate abundance; occupancy provides the best obtainable metric for assessing infrequently detected tropical vertebrates because it requires fewer detections than do metrics of abundance [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we assess current occupancy trends of terrestrial mammals and birds in tropical forest protected areas throughout the Neotropics, Africa, and Southeast Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we aggregate population-level occupancy trends into composite trends with the WPI to examine the status of tropical vertebrate biodiversity in protected areas at the global scale and at the local level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the properties of the composite index [21,22], we expect decreases in the WPI if (1) overall occupancy declines, but richness and evenness are constant, (2) species evenness declines, but richness and occupancy are constant, or (3) richness declines but occupancy and evenness are constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we expect no trend in the WPI if occupancies of particular species vary while overall occupancy, richness, and evenness do not change significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the last 38 y, the occupancy of 84 mammal (21.1%) and 27 bird populations (23.9%) exhibited significant declines, the occupancy of 94 mammal (23.6%) and 17 bird populations (15%) was stable, and the occupancy of 70 mammal (17.6%) and 18 bird populations (15.9%) exhibited significant increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to infrequent detection and, therefore, reduced power to detect change (Materials and Methods), the occupancy status of the other 150 mammal (37.7%) and 51 bird populations (45.1%) was classified as unknown (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 201 unknown status populations, 97 were of species evaluated at other TEAM sites, 48 were of species with consistently unknown occupancy status at multiple sites, and 56 were species found at a single site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002357.t001  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Occupancy trends did not differ significantly between vertebrate classes, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List statuses, or body mass categories (S1AS1C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of populations with unknown occupancy status differed significantly by dietary guild, landscape connectivity, and hunting level (S1DS1F Fig; S1 Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, while the variance in occupancy trends decreased over time, trends did not differ significantly based on the number of years of camera trap data (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that, despite differences in time series lengths among sites, the proportion of populations with increasing, decreasing, stable, or unknown occupancy status was consistent over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We document that (1) systematic decreases or increases in occupancy, richness, and evenness of mammal and bird populations did not occur in general (Fig 2a); (2) the occupancy dynamics of vertebrate populations were variable (Fig 2B and S3 Fig); (3) protected areas did not evince systemic declines in occupancy, richness, or evenness (Fig 2C); and (4) differences in occupancy dynamics were not significantly related to monitoring duration (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of a significant difference in occupancy trends based on IUCN Red List Status suggests that populations of TH and NT species in these protected areas are faring as well as populations of LC species during the examined time period (S1B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using unparalleled, standardized, in situ camera-trap data and robust analytics, we found that 15 protected areas throughout the worlds tropical forests have not exhibited systematic declines in occupancy, richness, or evenness of terrestrial mammal and bird species despite exhibiting extensive variability in population-level occupancy trends during the last 38 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to reports of declining tropical biodiversity based on expert opinion [13] and other biodiversity indicators [23], our inaugural pantropical assessment suggests less dire outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Meeting Aichi Targets requires systematic monitoring [24,25] coupled with indicators to track conservation progress [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most published data sources used with Aichi Target 12 indicators are relatively old given the ten-year time frame for evaluating progress under the CBD [26], are biased geographically toward temperate areas [27], rely heavily on expert opinion or disparate sources of information [28], may suffer from publication bias, and do not account for imperfect detection, which can bias estimates [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the WPI is the first Target 12 indicator that focuses on tropical species, uses current in situ data, and accounts for imperfect detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results and approach we present fill an important gap in the CBD indicators for Aichi Target 12 [30] by providing near real-time, essential biodiversity information [14] on species and community characteristics (i.e., occupancy, richness, and evenness) for elusive animals in tropical forestsunderstudied ecosystems with high concentrations of species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results contrast with severe biodiversity declines estimated by the Living Planet Index (LPI), which is also an Aichi Target 12 indicator [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the LPI reports a 56% decline in tropical populations, a 39% decline in global terrestrial populations, and an 18% decline in terrestrial populations in protected areas between 1970 and 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several factors may contribute to different results between the WPI and the LPI, in particular, the (1) temporal duration, (2) exclusion versus inclusion of nonprotected areas, and (3) level of community representativeness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assessment of populations for conservation planning requires long-term demographic data, especially for long-lived animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is possible that 38 y is an insufficient duration for detecting meaningful change, power analyses indicate that significant declines in the WPI can be detected within this timeframe [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found no significant differences in occupancy trends over time with respect to the number of years of data collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, continued monitoring is necessary to distinguish whether the detected occupancy trends reflect short-term fluctuations [31] or false stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the status of terrestrial vertebrate populations in protected areas may be less dire than previously suggested, we caution that our results are not generalizable to other, nonprotected landscapes, in which many species encounter habitat loss, hunting, and other threats [3234].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the TEAM site in the Udzungwa Mountains supports much higher species richness than a nearby forest with uncontrolled illegal hunting [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protected areas currently cover approximately 13% of land, providing a critical conservation tool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, maintenance of species occupancy, richness, and evenness within protected areas is likely insufficient to stem the ongoing global extinction crisis, because numerous species exist outside of current protected area coverage, or only a fraction of their geographic ranges are protected [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LPI reports more than twice the rate of decline when terrestrial populations outside of protected areas are considered; we recommend future application of the WPI to nonprotected areas for a comparable global examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How well particular species populations represent broader biodiversity trends may also influence differences in the conclusions from the WPI and LPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both are composite indices that calculate a geometric mean for the included populations (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the LPI uses population data from disparate sources and geographic locations, while the WPI calculates the geometric mean for all species observed in a community using a standardized sampling protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the WPI provides complete community-level representativeness that captures the consequences of community-level processes such as trophic cascades and compensatory dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trophic cascades may have occurred at some of the TEAM sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that species with substantial home range requirements, such as large carnivores [37], appear especially affected by habitat loss outside of protected areas (S4 Fig); this is particularly true for small reserves (e.g., Bwindi Impenetrable Forest [BIF], Pasoh Forest Reserve [PSH], S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both BIF and PSH have high proportions of herbivores with increasing occupancy and carnivores with decreasing occupancy; declines in carnivore occupancy may have released herbivores from top-down control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such a situation, variability would occur at the population level, but little change in overall occupancy, richness, or evenness at the community level would be reflected as community stability by the WPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, if higher predation from increased carnivore occupancy had caused declines in herbivore occupancy at the Congo site (Nouabali Ndoki [NNN]), community-level stability would also be observed (S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compensatory dynamics, in which changes in one population are counterbalanced by changes in another population, may have contributed to the community-level stability measured by the WPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple global studies have documented the maintenance of species richness and other community characteristics despite population-level changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a meta-analysis of disturbance studies indicated that compensatory dynamics contributed to observed community-level resiliency, that is, the lack of a strong relationship between variability in species-level colonization and extinction events and community-level dynamics [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a global analysis of population-level time series illustrated changes in species composition over time, but found no evidence for systematic change in species richness over time, indicating species substitution rather than loss [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the population-level, the occupancy of numerous populations at TEAM sites declined significantly, and even more were detected too infrequently to evaluate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the question of whether defaunation [1] is occurring in these protected areas despite community-level stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defaunation may, of course, have occurred in these protected areas prior to the onset of monitoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the synergistic effects of human activity and natural demographic variation may have also affected many populations during the examined time period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we found a higher proportion of populations with unknown occupancy status in patchy landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with fragmentation disrupting sourcesink dynamics and causing increases in the incidence of species rarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found a smaller proportion of hunted populations that were of unknown occupancy status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with hunting causing Allee effects that can result in increased local extinction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, numerous other factors, such as resource limitation, disease, extreme climate events, and environmental stochasticity may have also driven occupancy trends [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because most species are rare and observed infrequently [41], we expect that occupancy trends would not be measurable for some populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, variation in the proportion of unknown occupancy statuses among guilds is likely due to energetic constraints that result in fewer individuals from species of higher trophic levels [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assessing progress on meeting Aichi Target 11 requires measures of the effectiveness of protected areas [43], but current evaluations (e.g., Protected Area Management Effectiveness Assessments [PAME] [30]) do not include reliable information on such biodiversity outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data collection infrastructure and analytics that we have leveraged in this study provide a critical solution that is easily transferable to additional sites, ecosystems, and monitoring methods (e.g., acoustic data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our infrastructure works seamlessly as additional data are included, efficiently manages monitoring data, and computes complex analytics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our results are publically available (wpi.teamnetwork.org) so that anyone can monitor population trends in these protected areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this approach, we envision a world in which conservation decisions are based on large quantities of standard biodiversity data that are collected globally, shared openly, analyzed rapidly, and synthesized into indicators that assess the effectiveness of protected areas and specific conservation tactics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the first time, conservation can now be based on near real-time assessment of population trends that are unbiased and sensitive to demographic change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our highly scalable approach can be readily extended to governments and organizations with vested interests in monitoring wildlife, such as national park networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expansion of this new paradigm provides a global opportunity to identify successful conservation strategies to avert biodiversity collapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Occupancy_Modeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first examined how well dynamic occupancy models recovered dynamics based on the number of detections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we explored different numbers of detections and evaluated how well models recovered parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, for species with less than five detections per year, models always resulted in occupancy estimates close to one, as the models were unable to distinguish between low detection and low occupancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these exploratory analyses, we identified three cases based on the species detection level per site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thereafter used three different models depending on detection level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For populations with annual detection greater than 8% (Case 1), we used a Bayesian dynamic occupancy model that accounted for imperfect detection and employed covariates [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For populations with five or more detections per year but annual detection less than 8% (Case 2), we used the same Bayesian dynamic occupancy model as in Case 1, but omitted covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For populations with fewer than five detections per year (Case 3), we calculated the naÃ¯ve (i.e., observed) occupancy of a population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hereafter, we describe each of these three approaches in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
