Decadal-scale variation in diet forecasts persistently poor breeding under ocean warming in a tropical seabird  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Climate change effects on population dynamics of natural populations are well documented at higher latitudes, where relatively rapid warming illuminates cause-effect relationships, but not in the tropics and especially the marine tropics, where warming has been slow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we forecast the indirect effect of ocean warming on a top predator, Nazca boobies in the equatorial Galápagos Islands, where rising water temperature is expected to exceed the upper thermal tolerance of a key prey item in the future, severely reducing its availability within the boobies foraging envelope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 1983 to 1997 boobies ate mostly sardines, a densely aggregated, highly nutritious food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 1997 until the present, flying fish, a lower quality food, replaced sardines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breeding success under the poor diet fell dramatically, causing the population growth rate to fall below 1, indicating a shrinking population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Population growth may not recover: rapid future warming is predicted around Galápagos, usually exceeding the upper lethal temperature and maximum spawning temperature of sardines within 100 years, displacing them permanently from the boobies island-constrained foraging range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides rare evidence of the effect of ocean warming on a tropical marine vertebrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Long-term studies of animal populations have provided crucial evidence regarding effects of climate change on population size, abundance, and future viability [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, longitudinal studies at the population level often cannot effectively evaluate the proximate factors affecting population size under climate change, because disentangling the separate effects of demographic vital rates (breeding, survival, emigration, immigration) requires long-term individual-based data [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Connecting vital rates with climate to reach a mechanistic understanding of a natural populations vulnerability requires experimental approaches [8,9], or, since experimental manipulations are often impractical, data on survival, breeding, and movement under contemporary climate change and variability [6,10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Important progress has been made using this second method in long-term studies of identifiable individuals at locations where climate change is already rapid, permitting evaluation of cause-effect relationships in real time (e.g., [1114]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enables robust projections of species responses to climate change for these areas, but leaves significant gaps in our mechanistic understanding of population viability under climate warming for tropical animals because warming has been slow in much of the tropics [1517].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tropical systems are greatly underrepresented in climate change studies [1821], as are marine systems [2223].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the intersection of these two knowledge gaps, increasing our understanding of species responses to climate change in the tropical oceans is a high priority [18,24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The very high velocity and impact of climate change expected in much of the tropics [16,25,26], particularly the tropical oceans, makes this geographic bias especially noteworthy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Top predators may face stiff challenges in the tropics because their generation times are typically long, so they have little capacity for adaptive evolution on the time scale required by rapid climate change [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, many long-lived predators must cope with climate change chiefly through plastic phenotypic adjustments in real time, within a few generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aspects of their phenotypes, such as life history characteristics and diet composition, must be flexible enough that new combinations of vital rates and ecological interactions avoid negative population growth [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we exploit contemporary decadal-scale variation in diet and breeding of a tropical pelagic predator (the Nazca booby, Sula granti) in the Galápagos Islands to forecast the effect of future exclusion, by ocean warming, of a key prey species on this seabirds population growth rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate change will manifest in a variety of ways relevant to seabird populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include abiotic effects of precipitation, ocean acidification, sea level rise, and indirect biotic effects mediated by trophic relationships and other interspecific interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider regional increase in sea surface temperature and ensuing trophic effects on Nazca boobies under ocean warming, recognizing that climate change in this region will probably involve many additional effects on tropical seabirds, including altered frequency of extremes in climate such as El Niño events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is growing recognition that disrupted biotic interactions [28] are a main determinant of population responses of long-lived predators to climate change [2931].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focus on indirect thermal effects reflected by sea surface temperature (SST) because recent refinements of ocean-atmosphere coupled global climate models indicate that the ocean water in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) around Galápagos will become 4.5°C warmer over the next 100 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rate exceeds that of almost all other regions of the worlds oceans [32,33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a dramatic change in mean SST will probably make a critical prey species, Pacific sardines (Sardinops sagax; [34]), functionally absent from this top predators central-place foraging range around Galápagos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rising ocean temperatures are expected to move distributions of many marine fish pole-ward [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially true of small-bodied species like Pacific sardines with short generation times [35,36], and at the margin of a distribution [36] such as the peripheral population of this species in the equatorial Galápagos [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacific sardines are lipid-rich schooling forage fish [3840], prominent in the diets of Nazca boobies (Fig 1), Galápagos blue-footed boobies (S. nebouxii; [34]), and Galápagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki; [41]) until the 199798 El Niño event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The provenance of these prey is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacific sardines are capable of migrating or dispersing significant distances [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any such movements from the large possible source populations in the thermally temperate Peruvian Upwelling should stop within 100 years because the SST expected around Galápagos will usually exceed the upper incipient lethal temperature (the maximum temperature that can be tolerated indefinitely [43]) of adult, warm-adapted, temperate-origin Pacific sardines [44] (Fig 2, S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, if the population were local, self-sustaining, and tropical-origin and could tolerate high SST, it will live in waters at temperatures typically above the maximum spawning temperature of the species [4547] (Fig 2, S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the provenance of these prey, thermal constraints are expected to severely reduce their availability or exclude them from the boobies diet within 100 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(a) Numerical representation of the two major prey types in systematic and opportunistic regurgitation samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Missing years due to permit restrictions (mid-2000s) or to lack of data (1980s and mid-1990s; sardines (black fill) dominated casual observations during these gaps until the 199798 El Niño event [dashed line] but data not recorded).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  # prey items at top of bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breeding spans two calendar years (October-May), breeding seasons are labelled by the first year in each two-year spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black and gray bars do not sum to 1.0 because sardines and flying fish are not the only prey types in the diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Probability of a bird producing at least one prey item in 1,345 systematic regurgitation samples collected in January-April (probability is lower after 199798; Mann-Whitney U Test, N1 = 4, N2 = 11, Z = 2.48, P = 0.01; see S1 Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Food controls the breeding success of tropical seabirds (other environmental factors like predators and weather usually have negligible direct effects [49,50]), so contemporary variation in sardine availability affords a window into the future for Nazca boobies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1997 sardines became rare in the diets of sea lions and both booby species ([5153]; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lacking these valuable prey, the Galápagos population of blue-footed boobies (a sardine specialist [34]) declined by approximately 2/3 because breeding performance is linked to sardine availability [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dramatic demographic effect motivated our use of time series data on diet and longitudinal data on breeding of individually marked, known-age Nazca boobies to test the idea that a more flexible predator [34] can maintain breeding success and population viability when sardines are not available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis parallels the demographic approach commonly used at higher latitudes (e.g., [13,54]), taking advantage of a qualitative change in a key ecological relationship that anticipates the relationship expected under future ocean warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data_collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We studied diet, breeding, and survival of Nazca boobies as part of a long-term study at Punta Cevallos, Isla Española, Galápagos Islands (1°20 S, 89°40 W; see [55,56] for details of the site) from the 198384 breeding season until the 201213 season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nazca boobies in our population breed seasonally from October to June, with most egg laying completed by January, raising no more than one offspring to independence per annual breeding season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to breeding seasons by the calendar year in which the season began.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marking of adults and young of the year with uniquely numbered metal leg bands began in 1984.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young of the year were banded in 19841987 and 19922012 and analyses restricted to known-age birds use these individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most years some birds were banded as adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These adults are considered to be at least 4 years old when banded because 4 years is the median age at recruitment [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We monitored annual breeding parameters of banded adults in all years of the study except 19871991.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Newly independent young leave Galapagos for 27 years before recruiting to the breeding colony [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An individual was considered an adult, and therefore a potential breeder, from its year of recruitment until its death (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual Breeding Success is our primary dependent variable for breeding and is defined as the production of an independent offspring (yes/no) given that the adult was alive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual Breeding Success was scored as 1 for a given parent in a given year if that parent had an offspring late in the breeding season and we did not find its offspring dead at the nest site or (noting its band number) elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daily nest monitoring for all banded birds in some years allowed finer grained assessment at sequential reproductive stages, all of which were similarly dichotomous: laying of at least one egg given that the bird was alive (initiate a clutch | alive), hatching of one or more eggs given that a clutch was initiated (hatch an egg | clutch was initiated), and production of an independent offspring given that at least one egg hatched (produce independent offspring | hatch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Re-nesting occurs only if the first clutch fails, and we did not distinguish between hatchlings produced or offspring reaching independence from an original clutch versus from a re-nest clutch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual Breeding Success was monitored for all banded birds from 19922012 except 2007, when only a subset of banded individuals was tracked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete data on all reproductive stages were available for the period 19922004.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seasons 20052009 lack comprehensive monitoring of clutch initiation and hatching success, and 20102012 lack comprehensive information on hatching success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All analyses excluded rare adoption cases (adoptions affect only 1.6% of clutches) and one anomalous record when a pair raised two offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Annual survival and recapture data came from nighttime band resight surveys (BRS) conducted early in each season in 19842014 except 1988 [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We considered a bird dead (and so no longer a breeder) in the first year of a series of two or more years in which it did not appear in the BRS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resight probabilities in our population are essentially 1 for breeders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recapture rates are lower and more variable for nonbreeders [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only 1% of birds that were absent in two consecutive years ever reappear in our BRS dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Death is unlikely to be confounded with emigration because Nazca boobies are highly philopatric and show high colony fidelity after recruiting to their natal colony [55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of diet on the breeding success of male and female Nazca boobies was first examined in detail across the successive stages of a breeding attempt (laying eggs, hatching eggs, raising offspring).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young, middle-aged, and old breeders may respond differentially to environmental challenges (e.g., [59,60]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such age by environment interactions contribute to our understanding of life-history variation in the wild and may critically affect population dynamics [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these analyses focused on interactions between diet and age, as well as on the main effects of diet on breeding performance in Nazca boobies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Environmental variation impacts population viability through effects on vital rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Links between environmental variation and survival, reproductive success, and juvenile recruitment may not agree in strength or sign (e.g., [11,62]) so that consideration of multiple vital rates is prerequisite to understanding the total effect of an environmental parameter of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking this into consideration, we parameterized matrix population models with data on Nazca booby reproduction, juvenile survival, and adult survival to evaluate the effect of high- and low-quality diet on population growth rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Food_limitation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the Flying Fish Phase, Nazca boobies experienced lower energy density in their diet [39,40], smaller prey [34], and lower foraging success (Fig 1b), implying stricter food limitation than during the Sardine Phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nestling growth gave strong evidence of this limitation after the switch from the Sardine Phase to the Flying Fish Phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nazca boobies raise a single offspring per year [83], and the typical time between that offsprings hatching and acquisition of juvenile plumage [56,57] was 8 days longer during the Flying Fish Phase than during the Sardine Phase (linear mixed model  = -8.31, 95% CI = [-13.4, -3.1]; likelihood ratio test, 2 = 8.87, df = 1, P = 0.003; S6 Table, details in S1 Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural selection favors fast growth in this species because fast-growing nestlings have higher survival after becoming independent [57]; slow growth indicates a nutritional deficit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lengthening of the nestling period implies at least a 7% reduction in survival of newly independent offspring [57] during the Flying Fish Phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Breeding_success  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under the nutritional deficit imposed by a flying fish diet, we predicted lower breeding success during the Flying Fish Phase than during the Sardine Phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nazca boobies begin to breed successfully at approximately age 4 yrs, improve breeding performance up to age 8, and decline in performance between ages 15 and 21 (S5 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controlling these age effects from early adulthood until the peak in breeding success in middle age, we found that Annual Breeding Success (probability of producing an independent offspring given that bird was alive in that year) declined by approximately 50% during the Flying Fish Phase for each sex (Fig 3a and 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females poor performance during the Flying Fish Phase was due primarily to failure to hatch eggs and to raise hatchlings to independence, while the probability of initiating a breeding attempt (laying eggs) was similar in the two Fish Phases (Fig 4, S1 and S7 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young and middle-aged males showed similar deficits, as well as fewer initiations of breeding, in the Flying Fish Phase (Fig 4, S2 and S7 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sigmoid patterns of early life improvement were similar across Fish Phases, aside from markedly depressed performance during the Flying Fish Phase (all Age x Fish Phase interaction coefficients, with data on a logit scale, were close to zero and excluded from top models).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our long-term study has revealed no other environmental effects (e.g., predation, disease, anthropogenic effects) that can help explain the Fish Phase effect on Nazca booby demography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher elevation of females values than males for Annual Breeding Success (Fig 3) and clutch initiation (Fig 4) are both products of the mating system of this population: both sexes provide extensive parental care throughout the breeding attempt, but a strongly male-biased adult sex ratio excludes approximately 1/3 of males from the breeding pool in a given year [66].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparing breeding success across Fish Phase for adults in senescent decline, to complete analysis across the lifespan, relied on YBD, a proxy for chronological age [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with young and middle-aged adults, Fish Phase affected Annual Breeding Success and its component stages similarly across the range of YBD (Fig 3b and 3d; interactions between YBD and Fish Phase were poorly supported for both sexes for Annual Breeding Success and all component stages; S3, S4 and S8 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds in the five years preceding death showed dramatically lower breeding success during the Flying Fish Phase at almost all stages of breeding, although the effect for females initiating breeding was weak (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the evidence of senescent decline in Fig 5 is conservative because YBD confounds the flat or shallow performance trajectories of birds dying in late middle age with the steeper trajectories of truly old individuals (see S5 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Population_growth_rate_and_Fish_Phase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We parameterized the models of population growth rate () with our breeding data and with age-specific data on annual adult survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Candidate models for adult female survival that grouped time into a three-level factor (Period: Sardine Phase 19841996, the 1997 El Niño, and Flying Fish Phase 19982013) ranked higher than models with time-independent survival (S5 Table; LRT comparing models with and without Period: 2 = 192, df = 2, P less_thanless_than 0.001; see S1 Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grouping time into a four-level factor as above, except Sardine Phase was split into 19841991 (when diet data were sparse) and 19921996 (consistent diet of sardine), was less parsimonious (S5 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result validates the comparison between Sardine Phase and Flying Fish Phase using Period as a three-level factor, ignoring the sparseness of the diet data from 1984 to 1991.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Costs of reproduction may have been reduced by the poor breeding success under a flying fish diet: survival was ~4% higher in the Flying Fish Phase than in the Sardine Phase (S2 Fig; 95% CI for increased survival during the Flying Fish Phase relative to the Sardine Phase does not span zero,  = 0.55, 95%CI = [0.39, 0.70]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inter-annual variation in annual survival probability within each Fish Phase was important: the model differentiating each breeding season 19842013 in a multi-level factor best explained variation in the data (S5 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual survival was typically  0.90 (27/28 seasons at age 10, decreasing with age in known-age birds) and annual recapture probabilities were  0.90 for most years (24/28 seasons at age 10, increasing and then decreasing with age in known-age birds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stochastic  (the long-term average growth rate across 10,000 simulated projection intervals) for the Flying Fish Phase was markedly less than 1 (0.963), with a 95% confidence interval [0.962, 0.964] excluding 1 (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, stochastic  = 1.000 estimated from the last five years of the Sardine Phase (95% CI = [0.999, 1.000]; Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stochastic  for the Flying Fish Phase is robust: it is based on 15 years of data encompassing wide variation in fertility and survival (S2 and S4 Figs), which yield corresponding annual variation in  due to a source of variation that has not been accounted for.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A population decline is projected during the Flying Fish Phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid a stochastic  less than 1 during the Flying Fish Phase, a very large increase (~55%) in one of the demographic rates underlying fertility (juvenile survival or Annual Breeding Success) is necessary, applied across all years and all relevant demographic parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When Nazca boobies lost Pacific sardines from their diet their expected breeding success fell dramatically (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult males and females of all ages had much lower success hatching eggs and raising nestlings during the Flying Fish Phase (controlling individual identity and other variables; Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, males of all ages had lower success initiating breeding during the Flying Fish Phase (Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a direct consequence, and despite higher adult survival, during the Flying Fish Phase the stochastic population growth rate  was less than 1, forecasting a shrinking population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nazca boobies showed more diet flexibility than blue-footed boobies did during the Sardine Phase [34] and were able to adjust their foraging enough to raise some offspring during the Flying Fish Phase, unlike the sardine specialist blue-footed boobies [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the Nazca boobies foraging plasticity and complementary shifts in breeding and adult survival were insufficient to cope with the loss of sardines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither booby species can maintain a stable population under the conditions of the Flying Fish Phase at our Galápagos site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a lipid content of less_than 1% [84], flying fish are effectively junk food (sensu [85,86]) compared to sardines (lipid content 8%; [87]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This result provides rare evidence that ocean warming will affect a tropical marine vertebrate: the contemporary effect of a long-term qualitative change in diet on vital rates forecasts the demographic trajectory of this predator if, as seems likely, the predicted acceleration in ocean warming in the ETP makes sardines functionally absent from the Nazca boobys present foraging range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pelagic seabirds are well known for extreme mobility, yet extending the foraging range from the current breeding site is not a remedy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the Sardine Phase few trips exceeded a single daylight period and most birds foraged ~65km from the colony [88], but comparable data from the Flying Fish Phase are already several times those values [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the current link between diet and breeding applies in the future, and sardines are unavailable, then this Nazca booby population will shrink dramatically in a persistent Flying Fish Phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detecting changes in actual counts of birds is a task for the future: annual estimates of  from our matrix models show that shrinkage of the countable adult population should only now begin to be detectable (data not shown), due to this species' extended pre-breeding period, when they are at sea and not available to us to count, and to a bottom-heavy age structure for much of the Flying Fish Phase to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Large-scale range contractions and multi-decadal oscillation in population sizes of the Pacific sardine are well known on the continental margin around most of the Pacific, where fishery data provide long time-series of population abundance [89].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The historical record of the Galápagos population of sardines begins in the early 1980s (Galápagos lacks an industrial sardine fishery), providing too short a time span to evaluate the idea that sardine availability to Galápagos boobies oscillates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, the unusual oceanic location of Pacific sardines in Galápagos, distant from the important influences of the continental shelf and shoreline [42], may remove the drivers of the oscillation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, the Flying Fish Phase may be a novel foraging environment for which Nazca boobies are poorly prepared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the population of Pacific sardines in the nearby Peruvian Upwelling was large from the early 1970s until the mid-1990s, and nearly absent since then [89,90], roughly congruent with the pattern in Galápagos (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that case, the conditions of the Flying Fish Phase would occur regularly in the evolutionary history of this population and would not be novel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacific sardines are strong swimmers, with individuals ranging widely within their lifespans to track their habitat requirements, although typically on the pelagic edge of continental shelves [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active movement or passive transport in the northwest-flowing Humboldt Current from the Peruvian Upwelling to Galápagos has not been demonstrated but appears to be possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any such source-sink or migratory connection between the sardines in the Peruvian Upwelling and the Galápagos population could explain the recent diet shift of Galápagos marine predators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The availability of Pacific sardines to Nazca boobies and other top predators in Galápagos ([41,52]; Fig 1) during the Sardine Phase may be puzzling, given the frequency with which SST exceeded the sardines thermal tolerances in Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coarse 2° x 2° spatial scale of that analysis admits the possibility of small thermal refuges that could attract sardines during warm periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this idea, radio-tracking in the 1980s showed that most foraging of both Nazca and blue-footed boobies occurred at two hotspots above seamounts that might have deflected cool subsurface water to the surface [88].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these booby species were capturing mostly Pacific sardines at that time [34], their foraging distribution implies an abundance of sardines over the seamounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A variety of sub-surface predators also concentrated foraging activity at these sites [88].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Galápagos waters probably provided a marginal and patchy environment for Pacific sardines during the Sardine Phase of our study, yet sardines were effectively absent from the Nazca boobies foraging range during the Flying Fish Phase without any meaningful change in SST (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infer from this that population dynamics on the continental margin, with a population crash around the time that our Sardine Phase ended [89], combined with transport or active movement on the Humboldt Current to Galápagos, provides the best explanation for sardine availability in Galápagos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sardines in the Humboldt Current Ecosystem associate with a temperature range of 925°C [91], suggesting similar temperature preference and tolerance to those recorded for temperate-origin, warm-adapted sardines from the California Current Ecosystem used to measure UILT [44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regional warming of 4.5°C in Galápagos due to ocean warming expected within 100 years will move SST above the UILT and maximum spawning temperature of warm-acclimated temperate-origin Pacific sardines in all 12 months of an average year, and in all but 34 months of unusually cool years (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot rule out the persistence of micro-scale thermal refugia within the archipelago under the predicted warming, these results suggest that acceptable habitat will become extremely rare, both temporally and spatially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The oscillation of sardines on the continental margin is approximately anti-phase with that of anchovies (Engraulis spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; [89]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predators there can switch between sardines and anchovies, depending on availability, and obtain high quality schooling prey in either case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our diet samples never contained anchovies, and predators of sardines in Galápagos evidently struggle when sardines are rare, lacking a comparable replacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the Galápagos sardines are an oscillating population, then the cycle over the continental shelf suggests that the prey population will rebound in roughly 5 to 10 years [89,92].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But regardless of past and present population dynamics of Pacific sardines in Galápagos, the considerations summarized in Fig 2 indicate that in the longer term sardines will be functionally absent from the diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results forecast poor conditions at this populations current location due to the indirect trophic effect of the ocean warming component of climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nazca boobies show remarkable fidelity to that location: virtually all individuals breed within a few hundred meters of their natal nest [55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, exceptional individuals do settle elsewhere [55], so a range shift [4] appears to be possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A continental or fully marine animal might have the option of shifting its range across relatively continuous habitat to meet its critical ecological requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, seabirds in much of the worlds oceans live in a fundamentally discontinuous habitat, punctuated by the location of breeding islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of an archipelago like Galápagos, our study population on the southernmost Galápagos island might move to a northern island, but SST is even higher to the north, following a consistent gradient influenced by the Humboldt Current in the south [93].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They might move to the western margin of Galápagos where the cool upwelling of the Equatorial Countercurrent [93] could provide a refuge of limited extent for a point (probably unstable) population of sardines and a remnant population of Nazca boobies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outside Galápagos, the islands within 2000 km include only one (Cocos) that is not either already occupied by Nazca boobies (Malpelo, La Plata, Lobos de Tierra, and Lobos de Afuera) or already occupied by congeneric habitat specialists that are probably competitive superiors in that area (guano islands in the Peruvian Upwelling).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study population of Nazca boobies is the largest of several in Galápagos, representing approximately 60% of the archipelagos population [55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one other significant breeding site exists, on Isla Malpelo (4° 00N 81° 36W), 1000 km to the northeast, supporting the worlds largest [94], but poorly documented, Nazca booby colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While SST around Malpelo is predicted to rise ~4°C [32] and will also be unsuitable for Pacific sardines, it cannot be excluded as a suitable future breeding site without knowing more about the local diet and its links to breeding success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, range reduction to a single significant colony at Malpelo would represent a consequential change in conservation status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The example of Nazca boobies illustrates the special difficulties that island-breeding, ocean-feeding vertebrates will face in a rapidly changing climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, detecting and predicting the effects of climate change on these animals will generally be challenging, despite their relative conspicuousness [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a long-term study of Nazca boobies limited to only one Fish Phase could not have detected the dramatic demographic effect of the disappearance of sardines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projection of this populations decline under ocean warming, despite little contemporary change in the ETP, is clarified by several circumstances: Nazca boobies are top predators (higher trophic levels do not impinge on their population dynamics), their diet composition is simple, and loss of their sardine prey is catastrophic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abiotic, especially thermal, effects of climate change on populations are pervasive and well-documented, but biotic effects of trophic and other biological interactions are acknowledged less often [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biotic effects similar to that of sardines on Nazca boobies are probable for other species pairs whose separate niches include different habitat types that are themselves affected differently by climate change (for example, polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and their marine prey [95].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results may also forecast, more generally, population trends of many organisms with a close ecological tie to another, but with contrasting capacities for range shift as the climate changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
