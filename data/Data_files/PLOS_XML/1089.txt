Knoetschkesuchus langenbergensis gen. nov. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., a new atoposaurid crocodyliform from the Upper Jurassic Langenberg Quarry (Lower Saxony, northwestern Germany), and its relationships to Theriosuchus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We report a new, small-sized atoposaurid crocodyliform from the Upper Jurassic of Langenberg, Northeastern Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atoposaurids are small-sized Mesozoic crocodyliforms of mainly European distribution, which are considered to be phylogenetically close to the origin of Eusuchia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knoetschkesuchus langenbergensis gen. nov. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. is represented by two well-preserved skulls and additional cranial and postcranial remains representing different ontogenetic stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3D reconstructions of a juvenile skull based on micro-computed tomography allow the most detailed description of cranial remains of any atoposaurid hitherto presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our new analysis contradicts previous preliminary assignment of the Langenberg atoposaurids to Theriosuchus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knoetschkesuchus gen. nov. is characterized in particular by the presence of two dental morphotypes in the maxilla and dentary, slit-like secondary choanae within a narrow groove on the surface of the pterygoid, absence of lacrimonasal contact, presence of an antorbital foramen and an external mandibular fenestra, and proportional characters of the interorbital and intertemporal region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar combination of characters allows attribution of Theriosuchus guimarotae to Knoetschkesuchus, forming the new combination Knoetschkesuchus guimarotae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis provides an osteological basis for the separation of Theriosuchus and Knoetschkesuchus and helps further delineate generic differences in other closely related crocodylomorphs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our phylogenetic analysis corroborates inclusion of Knoetschkesuchus into Atoposauridae and supports a position of Atoposauridae within Eusuchia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The discovery of the dwarfed sauropod dinosaur Europasaurus holgeri made the Langenberg Quarry a fossil locality of world-wide importance [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The marly limestones at the Langenberg near Goslar, deposited in a shallow marine inlet or a small marginal basin of the German Late Jurassic Basin [2, 3], yield a high diversity of invertebrate, micro- and macrovertebrate as well as plant fossils [4, 5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these fossils are the remains of marine and terrestrial atoposaurid crocodylians [68], which here are described for the first time in detail for the first time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous preliminary description placed the specimens in the genus Theriosuchus, but provided only limited evidence for that determination [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Atoposauridae is a family of small sized crocodyliforms typically smaller than one meter in body length that was first described by the French palaeontologist Gervais in 1871 [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were included into Crocodylia by the German palaeontologist Zittel in 1890 [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atoposaurid crocodyliforms have a short snout with paired external nares, in relation to the overall skull proportions large orbits and relatively small supratemporal fenestrae in relation to the overall skull proportions, enlarged anterior maxillary teeth, an often reduced or closed antorbital fenestra, slender limbs, and occasionally reduced osteodermal armor [1117].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Buscalioni and Sanz [17], Atoposauridae comprises the five core genera Theriosuchus, Alligatorium, Alligatorellus, Montsecosuchus and Atoposaurus [17, 18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monophyly of this group has been questioned [16], because both the skull morphology and the small body size are also a strong ontogenetic signal in morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the majority of skeletons of atoposaurids have been found in limestone slabs and were preserved more or less flattened, further complicating morphological interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In phylogenetic analyses, usually only the genus Theriosuchus is coded, sometimes also Alligatorium [1925].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theriosuchus itself is probably the best-known and best-preserved taxon within Atoposauridae [26, 27], although a good diagnosis of this taxon is still pending.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several characters separateTheriosuchus from other atoposaurids, which make an assignment to Atoposauridae uncertain [8, 16, 17, 19, 24, 28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed examination of new finds and thorough descriptions will help to shed new light on the taxonomic status of Theriosuchus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our re-examination of the atoposaurid specimens from Langenberg assigned to Theriosuchus pusillus (i.e., DFMMh/FV 200 and DFMMh/FV 605) [8] raised doubts regarding the validity of this determination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exceptionally well preserved material warranted a more thorough description and a detailed comparison with other species of Theriosuchus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Langenberg remains have been preparated meticulously, parts of the skulls remained in the sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, micro-computed tomography (CT) made it possible to study one of these skulls (DFMMh/FV 605) in more detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to add a lot of information to the anatomy of the specimens with the help of three-dimensional (3D) images obtained from the CT studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the Theriosuchus material from Langenberg provides new information on the characters included in a diagnosis of Theriosuchus, adds new information on different ontogenetic states and 3D studies of its anatomy, and in the end makes it possible to separate these specimens from Theriosuchus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Locality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All described material has been found in the Langenberg Quarry at the northern rim of the Harz Mountains near the town of Goslar, Lower Saxony, northern Germany (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quarry exposes well-preserved sections of Upper Jurassic shallow marine strata [2931].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beds consist of impure carbonates which grade into marls and which are tilted to a near vertical, slightly overturned position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quarrying by blasting proceeds along strike, exposing the beds only in cross-section and not along bedding planes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the sequence, changes in water depth and clear brackish influences are evident in the sediment composition and invertebrate fossil record, but except for very rare dinosaur tracks, evidence of subaerial exposure is missing [3032].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well dated biostratigraphically, the sediments in the quarry range from late Oxfordian to late Kimmeridgian in age [2931] and belong to the SÃ¼ntel Formation [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most terrestrial vertebrate remains including the sauropod dinosaur Europasaurus holgeri [3436] and all atoposaurid material described herein was found in bed 83 (Fig 2), and not in bed 93 as erroneously stated in several recent publications [3436].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bed 83 is a light grey-greenish marly limestone, which contains micritic intraclasts up to several cm in diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been assigned to the Mittleres Kimmeridge, a northwest-German equivalent to the lower part of the Upper Kimmeridgian of the international chronostratigraphic time scale [37, 38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Paleogeographically, the Langenberg Quarry is situated in the Lower Saxony Basin, which covered most of northern Germany during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region was probably an archipelago that was surrounded by large paleo-islands [39], which were the source of the clastic components in the sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All described fossils were found in an Upper Jurassic (Upper Kimmeridgian) marine marly limestone, bed 83 after Fischer [29], at the Langenberg Quarry near Goslar, Lower Saxony in northwestern Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The material comprises the following collection numbers: DFMMh/FV 200, slab with one individual; DFMMh/FV 605, complete skull of a juvenile individual; DFMMh/FV 261, angular; DFMMh/FV 790.12, partial left dentary; DFMMh/FV 279, femur; DFMMh/FV 790.11, metatarsal; and DFMMh/FV 325, osteoderms, vertebra and partial ribs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fossils are housed at the Dinosaurier-Freilichtmuseum MÃ¼nchehagen/Verein zur FÃ¶rderung der NiedersÃ¤chsischen PalÃ¤ontologie (e.V.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (catalogue numbers DFMMh/FV), in Rehburg-Loccum near Hannover in northern Germany (Dinopark MÃ¼nchehagen, Alte ZollstraÃe 5, 31547 Rehburg-Loccum, Germany).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statutes of the FÃ¶rderverein (supporting association) state that all of the DFMMh material will always be accessible to researchers; in case of the liquidation of the association it will imperatively be transferred to a public institution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preparation of the specimens was carried out at the preparation lab of the Dinosaurier- Freilichtmuseum MÃ¼nchehagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matrix surrounding the bones was removed using pneumatic micro-scribes (Micro Jacks by PaleoTools).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the small size of the specimens, most of the morphological studies of the specimens were carried out under a stereomicroscope (Leica WILD MZ8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Micro-computer tomography scans were carried out at the Steinmann Institut at the University of Bonn with a v|tome|x phoenix|x-ray as well as at the Museum fÃ¼r Naturkunde Berlin by using a Phoenix|x-ray Nanotom tomography machine (GE Sensing and Inspection Technologies GmbH, Wunstorf, Germany).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices were reconstructed using the datos|x-reconstruction software, version 1.5.0.22 64 bit (GE Sensing and Inspection Technologies GmbH, Phoenix|x-ray).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting volume with the highest resolution was segmented and analyzed with the softwares Avizo v.8.1 and MeshLab v.1.1.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
No permits were required for the described study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Diagnosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to Schwarz & Salisbury 2005, K. guimarotae possesses the following unique combination of features: lateral surface of squamosal beveled ventrally, with a distinct lateral notch rostrally; caudolateral corner of the squamosal forms a rounded, caudally projecting process with sculpture pitting on its dorsal surface that is similar to that on the rest of the cranial table; premaxillomaxillary suture aligned caudomedially in dorsal aspect; minimum space between supratemporal foramina comprises one third of the total width of the cranial table; dentition that comprises only pseudocaniniform and lanceolate-shaped teeth, all with mesial and distal carinae; minimum width of the frontal between the orbits comprises one third of the maximum width of the skull at the orbits; external mandibular fenestra present; all vertebral bodies amphicoelous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to the genus diagnosis of Knoetschkesuchus gen. nov. as given in this paper, the minimum space of the supratemporal foramina and the interorbital space, the dentition with two tooth morphs, and the presence of an external mandibular fenestra are diagnostic on a genus level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurence of amphicoelous vertebrae is not an autapomorphic feature and should be omitted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knoetschkesuchus guimarotae (new combination) is distinguished from K. langenbergensis by a caudomedially directed premaxillo-maxillary suture, a more elongate prefrontal, a rectangular parietal, absence of a distinct lateral crest on the descending postorbital process, a squamosal medially overlapping the postorbital in its rostral extent, secondary choanae positioned in the rostral half of the pterygoid wing, a mandibular symphysis extending to the 6th dentary tooth, and a relatively higher angular and caudal mandibular ramus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preservation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All specimens are three-dimensionally preserved with little or no distortion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several bones have been removed from the matrix, but their foramina, other openings and fractures are still filled with carbonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotype skull is prepared from dorsally and both lateral sides, but ventrally embedded in matrix (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large crack dorsally at the cranial table has been filled with glue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The juvenile skull DFMMh/FV 605 has been prepared completely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Teeth are preserved in situ on both skulls and the isolated dentary (DFMMh/FV 790.12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both skulls were slightly crushed dorsally during diagenesis, and in particular DFMMh/FV 200 shows medially tilted dermal bones because of the distortion of the skull.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigations by CT of the juvenile skull DFMMh/FV 605 supplement the description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most vertebrae lack their neural spines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the bones shows signs of abrasion or weathering, but several bones have fractures along their surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Completeness and preservation of small cranial elements and other bones indicate a short distance transport before burial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on preservation of the skeletal regions are given together with the description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Phylogeny  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
84 crocodylomorph taxa were coded for 321 morphological characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The matrix was taken from Turner [21], but several changes in the coding were made to adapt it for the analysis of this taxon (see supplementary data for detailed documentation of changes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of taxa used here is smaller than in the original matrix of Turner [21], as the focus of this study lay on the Neosuchian relationships of Knoetschkesuchus langenbergensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theriosuchus grandinaris [53] and the new taxon were added to the matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theriosuchus ibericus has been left out due to the pending re-description of this taxon (Tennant et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pers comm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theriosuchus guimarotae (Knoetschkesuchus guimarotae new combination in this work) was re-coded due to poor previous coding in the matrix of Turner [21] (S1 Text, S1 Matrix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The poor coding of this taxon by Turner [21] is simply the result of insufficient image quality in the original publication [21] (i.e., the pdf was set to a very low resolution and printing quality that obscured the fine anatomical details), lack of the description of some data that could be added now (DS pers obs) and finally some mistakes in the reconstructional drawing of the skull in Schwarz & Salisbury [21] (see Ontogeny for explanation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TNT v. 1.5 [54, 55] was used for the phylogenetic analysis, following in parts the procedure described by Turner [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tree was rooted on Gracilisuchus stipanicicorum as an outgroup taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All characters in the matrix were used unmodified, so no status like additive or inactive was chosen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the analysis, the taxon Elosuchus cherifiensis turned out to severely influence the stability of the trees and therefore has been excluded within TNT directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the remaining 83 taxa, a heuristic search with equally weighted parsimony was carried out, calculating Wagner trees with 10000 replicates (with random addition sequences = RAS), and a following TBR branch swapping with holding 10 trees per replicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best trees obtained at the end of the replicates were subjected to TBR branch swapping again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zero-length branches were collapsed if they lacked support under any of the most parsimonious reconstructions (rule 1 of consense options in TNT [54, 55]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The heuristic search included a total number of 18931860 rearrangements and produced 18 most parsimonious trees (MPT) with a tree length of 1418 steps each, a consistency index (CI) of 0.279, and a retention index (RI) of 0.634.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The character support of the nodes in the most parsimonious reconstructions was calculated with the technique of Bremer support in TNT, and is visible as a consensus tree (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A Maximum Parsimony Analysis (MPA) was done with the same matrix, resulting via 674652933 rearrangements in only one, very stable tree with a tree length of 1669 steps, a CI of 0,874, and aRI of 0,976 (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jackknife support analysis and bootstrap analysis were run in TNT on the character matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The jackknife support analysis was performed as in Turner [21], using 1000 replicates of RAS followed by TBR branch swapping (saving 10 trees per replicate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bootstrap analysis was done with a simple addition replicate and 1000 bootstrap replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tree topologies obtained both from jackknifing and bootstrapping are summarized using GC frequencies (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(A) Single most parsimonious tree resulting from maximum parsimony analysis (MPA) of 82 ingroup taxa and 321 phenotypic characters (tree length is 1669 steps, CI = 0,874, RI = 0,976).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atoposauridae is marked bold in here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) The three alternative arrangements within Atoposauridae out of the 18 most parsimonious trees resulting from the heuristic search of the matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In all of the obtained trees, Knoetschkesuchus langenbergensis clusters with Theriosuchus and Alligatorium in a clade that depicts Atoposauridae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unit of Atoposauridae is supported by Jackknifing and Bootstrap analysis, but has very low Bremer support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the 18 trees of the heuristic search, three different topologies within Atoposauridae are possible (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knoetschkesuchus langenbergensis and Knoetschkesuchus guimarotae (new combination) form a very stable sister group relationship with high support values (S1 and S2 Figs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the topologies do also indicate a close relationship between a clade consisting of Knoetschkesuchus langenbergensis and Knoetschkesuchus guimarotae new combination, and Theriosuchus grandinaris, which has also high support values in the Boostrap and Jackknife analysis (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theriosuchus pusillus, T. symphiestodon and Alligatorium are swapping their positions and have lower support values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas most previous phylogenetic analyses have placed Atoposauridae in a position near the basis of all Neosuchia (e.g., [19, 24, 28, 5658], more recent works have placed them as a sister group to Paralligatoridae, within Eusuchia and together with Paralligatoridae as the sister group to Crocodylia [21, 23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In consistence with the analysis provided by Turner [21], the clade Atoposauridae in this work (Fig 9) is nested deeply within Eusuchia, and closely related to the clade Paralligatoridae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the obtained most parsimonious tree is in many aspects similar to the strict consensus tree represented by Turner [21: fig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14], there are some differences in the arrangements of single clades that might be the result of a smaller amount of taxa used and corrections of the coding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main groups Crocodyliformes, Neosuchia, and Eusuchia are similarly depicted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main differences refer to the placement of Susisuchidae, which are in contrast to the placement within Neosuchia in Turner [21] included within Eusuchia and part of a larger clade comprising also Hylaeochampsidae in the work here (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to Turner [21], also both coded species of Allodaposuchus cluster together as closely related to Atoposauridae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bernissartia is positioned directly at the base of Crocodylia, but the support values are not good for this arrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ontogeny  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The material described from Knoetschkesuchus langenbergensis represent specimens of at least three different body sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cranial material of specimens DFMMh/FV 200 and DFMMh/FV 605 represents different ontogenetic stages (see below) and sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isolated angular DFMMh/FV 269 is larger than the articulated angular of specimen DFMMh/FV 200, whereas the isolated postcranial material is comparable in size to DFMMh/FV 200.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum number of indiviuals thus would be three, based on size differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ontogenetic traits are based on both proportions and morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proportional changes are described with biometric skull ratios (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportional lengthening and widening of the rostral region of the skull is described 1.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  by the ratio between rostral skull length and total skull length, which changes from 0.37 in the smaller skull (DFMMh/FV 605) to 0.47 in the larger skull (DFMMh/FV 200); and 2.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  by the ratio between length and width of the rostrum of the skull, which is 1.37 in DFMMh/FV 605 and 1.50 in DFMMh/FV 200.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rostral region of the skull in Knoetschkesuchus langenbergensis lengthens proportionally in relation to the total skull length, as well as in relation to its width (Fig 7A and 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes correspond to extant crocodylians, which are initially extremely brevirostrine with a high length/width ratio of the rostrum, then grow in rostral length [52, 59, 60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In older ontogenetic stages, the width of the rostral region in extant crocodylians increases again [52, 59, 60], which might explain why the difference between DFMMh/FV 605 and DFMMh/FV 200 is not too big.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ratio between the width and the length of the cranial table is 0.64 in the smaller skull (DFMMh/FV 605) and 0.53 in the larger skull (DFMMh/FV 200), indicating that the cranial table gets wider during growth as in extant crocodylians [52, 59, 60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio between the rostral width of the cranial table and the caudal width of the cranial table is 0.95 in the smaller skull (DFMMh/FV 605) and 0.66 in the larger skull, which is due to the increasing converging of the lateral margins of the cranial table in rostral direction as in extant crocodylians [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Orbital size is proportially larger in early ontogenetic stages of extant crocodylians [59, 60] and described as ratio between orbital length and total skull length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio between orbital length and total skull length changes from 0.28 in the small skull (DFMMh/FV 605) to 0.32 in the large skull (DFMMh/FV 200), which is not significant and demonstrates that the orbit remains rather large in relation to the total skull dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small size-reduction of the orbit during ontogeny is known from atoposaurids in general [15, 17, 61], and might represent paedomorphism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Shape change of the supratemporal foramen during ontogeny have been documented by a number of authors for extant crocodylians [52, 59, 60, 62], and are also visible in Knoetschkesuchus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shape of the supratemporal foramen is narrow oval and 54% longer than wide in DFMMh/FV 605, but more rounded rectangular and 42% longer than wide in DFMMh/FV 200 (Fig 7A and 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar, ontogenetic change in the outline of the supratemporal foramen is visible in specimens of K. guimarotae (new combination) [61] (Fig 10C and 10F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, coding the shape of the supratemporal foramen for a phylogenetic analysis (see Character 254 in S1 Text) might require using multiple stages for one character.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in the outline of the supratemporal foramen does not influence the proportional contribution of the surrounding bones to the margin of the foramen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular the parietal retains its mostly medial contribution to the foramens margins and does not expand caudolaterally in the larger specimen DFMMh/FV 200.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the proportional changes of the supratemporal foramen influence the absolute and relative width of the intrafenestral bar formed by the parietal and rostrally by the frontal [52, 59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the expansion of the supratemporal foramen, the frontal becomes restricted to the rostromedial tip of the supratemporal foramen in DFMMh/FV 200 (Fig 7A and 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medial part of the postorbital is broader in DFMMh/FV 200 than in DFMMh/FV 605 and sculptured, and it restricts the frontal contribution to the rostromedial corner of the supratemporal foramen (Fig 7A and 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The squamosal surface on the cranial table is reduced by the expansion of the supratemporal foramen in DFMMh/FV 200, as is the parietal surface (Fig 7A and 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exactly similar modifications are visible in the cranial table of Knoetschkesuchus guimarotae (Fig 10F), whereas the former skull reconstruction of Knoetschkesuchus guimarotae [IFPUB Gui Croc 7309, 61: Fig 2] does not correctly depict the relationships between parietal, frontal, and postorbital on the skull roof (DS pers obs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All in all, the observations made here contradict the statement of Schwarz & Salisbury [61] that the shape and the size of the supratemporal foramina would not change in K. guimarotae (new combination) during ontogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Skull bone sculpturing is deeper in the larger skull of Knoetschkesuchus langenbergensis (DFMMh/FV 200) and the isolated angular DFMMh/FV 369, whereas the smaller specimen DFMMh/FV 605 possesses only faint sculpturing, which indicates an ontogenetically younger age [52, 59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frontals are fused in the smaller specimen DFMMh/FV 605.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison with DFMMh/FV 200, the frontals of DFMMh/FV 605 are wider between the orbits and on the cranial table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both skulls, the parietals are fused, but the former median suture is still visible as a median fusion line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, in extant Alligator, frontals and parietals are unfused after hatching and fuse only until young adult stage [62, 63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The probably most striking ontogenetic change of a skull element is visible in the lacrimal, which is caudolaterally reduced to a narrow process in DFMMh/FV 605, but wider in DFMMh/FV 200 (Figs 4C, 5C, 5D, 7A, 7B and 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lacrimal of DFMMh/FV 605 is completely excluded from a nasal contact by the prefrontal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In DFMMh/FV 200, the lacrimal contacts the nasal in a very narrow tip (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar shape change of the lacrimal is visible in Knoetschkesuchus guimarotae (Fig 10E and 10F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The supraoccipital is dorsally exposed on the cranial table in DFMMh/FV 605, as in the smallest specimen of Knoetschkesuchus guimarotae [IFPUB Gui Croc 7309, 61: Fig 2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to Theriosuchus pusillus, K. langenbergensis and K. guimarotae have a very reduced sharp ridge on the lateral surface of the angular [21: char.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  219].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the size of skull ridges increases in ontogenetically older extant crocodylians [59], this is most probably ontogenetic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to the observations discussed above, DFMMh/FV 605 represents a specimen of rather young ontogenetic age with partly unfused sutures, slight dermal ornamentation, and significantly juvenile skull proportions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the dense sculpturing on the bone surface, more adult skull proportions and the fused sutures of the dorsal vertebrae identify DFMMh/FV 200 as a subadult or adult specimen [61, 64] close to maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The angular DFMMh/FV 269 belongs to another, still older and larger specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traits not discussed here as ontogenetic variation are significant for taxonomy and phylogeny of Knoetschkesuchus langenbergensis and are discussed below by comparisons with Theriosuchus (Figs 10 and 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Taxonomic_relationships_with_Theriosuchus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relationships_to_other_atoposaurids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Knoetschkesuchus shows more similarities to Theriosuchus than to the other European atoposaurids Alligatorellus, Alligatorium, Atoposaurus [15, 83], and Montsecosuchus [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except Montsecosuchus from the Early Cretaceous of Spain, all of these taxa derive from Upper Jurassic deposits of Southwestern Germany and France [9, 15, 83], and therefore existed contemporaneously with Knoetschkesuchus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of ontogenetically influenced features in the skull of atoposaurids make it difficult to identify reliable taxonomic characters in Atoposauridae, but the group is generally characterized by small body size of not exceeding one meter in length, a brevirostrine skull, and orbits at least twice as large as the supratemporal fenestrae [15, 17, 18, 28, 61, 73, 78, 83, 84].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the past, it has been suggested that the specimens of Atoposaurus might represent juvenile individuals of the sympatric atoposaurids Alligatorium and Alligatorellus [17], or that all three taxa belong to the ontogenetic growth series of a single taxon [16, 28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a recent Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of skull measurements and additional anatomical evidence have demonstrated that Atoposaurus, Alligatorium, and Alligatorellus can be treated as separate taxa [83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some new, important osteoderm-based characters [83] cannot be used for taxonomic discussions of atoposaurids here, because they are not preserved in the osteoderms of Knoetschkesuchus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to the revised diagnosis of Alligatorellus [83], Knoetschkesuchus differs from Alligatorellus in its sculptured rostral part of the skull and sculptured external surface of the dentary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to Alligatorellus, Knoetschkesuchus possesses an enlarged fifth maxillary tooth, two tooth-morphs in the upper and lower jaws, a narrow wedge-like rostral frontal process, raised orbital rims, perforated supratemporal foramina, and a rostral process of the squamosal restricted to the skull roof (i.e., not reaching the orbital margin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Knoetschkesuchus differs from Atoposaurus by possessing a sculptured skull (smooth/unsculptured in Atoposaurus) and palpebral bones (absent in Atoposaurus) [83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, Knoetschkesuchus possesses osteoderms, the absence of which in Atoposaurus is considered to be diagnostic and not due to an ontogenetically young developmental stage of the specimens [83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Wellnhofer [15], Knoetschkesuchus differs from Atoposaurus also in the presence of well-developed supratemporal foramina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alligatorium is distinguished from Alligatorellus and Atoposaurus based on osteoderm morphology by Tennant and Mannion [83], which is not preserved in this detail in Knoetschkesuchus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knoetschkesuchus differs from Montsecosuchus in its caudoventrally directed retroarticular process of the mandible, and absence of a domed or dolichocephalous occiput, and in the length-to-width-proportions of the skull [15, 18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distribution_of_Knoetschkesuchus_in_the_Jurassic_and_ecological_implications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the last years, fossil finds and localities yielding bone material and/or isolated teeth attributed to Theriosuchus have increased [see overviews in 61, 68, 78, 83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The type species Theriosuchus pusillus comes from the Lower Cretaceous (Berriasian) Purbeck Formation [26, 27, 64, 65, 71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most finds are concentrated to the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous of West-Central Europe, where Theriosuchus represents a typical member of mid- to late Mesozoic crocodyliform communities [79], but remains of Theriosuchus are also known from the Upper Cretaceous of West and East Europe [68, 85].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rare, and partially ambiguous reports of Theriosuchus are known from the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous of Eastern Asia [53, 70, 86], the Mid-Jurassic of Madagascar [87],and the Lower Cretaceous of North America [88].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent find of a dentary of Theriosuchus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from the Middle Jurassic (Bajocian-Bathonian) of Scotland [78] represents the geologically oldest fossil evidence of Theriosuchus (but see remark above about the putative problems with the determination of this specimen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knoetschkesuchus langenbergensis from the Langenberg Quarry in German and K. guimarotae from the Guimarota coalmine in Portugal [61, 81] are contemporaneous taxa from the late Jurassic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their generic separation from Theriosuchus reduces the biogeographic diversity of Theriosuchus, and adds to the overall diversity of Late Jurassic crocodyliform paleocommunities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Guimarota locality in Leiria, Portugal lies at the eastern margin of the Lusitanian Basin and is an abandoned coal mine with sediments belonging to the AlcobaÃ§a-Formation [89].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A diverse crocodyliform community has been described, comprising partial skeletons and isolated dental and skeletal elements of Machimosaurus hugii [81, 90, 91], Bernissartia sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [80], Lisboasaurus estesi [92], Goniopholis baryglyphaeus [93], Lusitanisuchus mitracostatus [94] and Knoetschkesuchus guimarotae (new combination) [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Guimarota locality represents a lagoonal environment with occasional freshwater influx and periodical flooding by salt water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area can be imagined as a swamp like region, comparable superficially with recent Mangrove forests [89].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Guimarota crocodyliforms had a large variety of different prey: Machimosaurus hugii was a marine crocodyliform that probably cam only to the coast for egg laying and fed on fish and marine reptiles such as marine turtles [81].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Goniopholis baryglyphaeus was a large, amphibious and generalistic taxon that preyed on shelly and also soft prey items feasible for its size, comparable to extant Alligator mississippiensis [93].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small (about 0.5 m in length) crocodyliforms Lisboasaurus estesi [92] and Lusitanisuchus mitracostatus [94] had a diet of overally small prey items, most probably different kinds of insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K. guimarotae is interpreted to feed on insects and small vertebrates, with a similar spectrum to juvenile extant crocodylians [61, 80].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Langenberg Quarry belongs to the southern part of the Lower Saxony Basin, which represents shallow marine conditions and was interspersed with small islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sediments in the Langenberg Quarry seem to have occasional freshwater influx, and salinity levels changed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crocodyliform assemblage from the Langenberg Quarry comprises besides Knoetschkesuchus langenbergensis also partial skeletons of Goniopholis, Machimosaurus, and Steneosaurus [68], it is therefore less diverse than that of Guimarota and contains allochthonous and autochtonous elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the marine crocodyliforms Machimosaurus and Steneosaurus would have fed mainly on fish and marine turtles, the feeding preferences of Goniopholis and Knoetschkesuchus are comparable with the same taxa from Guimarota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the Langenberg Quarry is probably an allochthonous deposit, into which animals and plants from the nearby islands were transported (see section Locality), so that the quarry itself does not represent the genuine habitat of T. langenbergensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the Late Jurassic and also the earliest Cretaceous, Europe was covered largely by shallow epicontinental seas, with interspersed continental islands, such as the Iberian Meseta and the Amorican Massif [95].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  North America and Eurasia were separating by ongoing crustal extension that started already in the Late Triassic and initiated subsidence of the Lusitanian Basin [96].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high Jurassic and Cretaceous diversity of neosuchian crocodyliforms is attributed to paleogeography with a system of island archipelagos and periodic sea level changes [39, 97, 98], which, for example, could have facilitated allopatric speciation of different atoposaurids [83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knoetschkesuchus guimarotae from the Lusitanian basin inhabited an area at the margin of the Iberian Meseta, whereas K. langenbergensis is associated with a landmass comprising the Rhenisch Massif, Bohemian Massiv, and London-Brabant Massif [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biogeographically, dispersal between the two localities in the Late Jurassic would have been possible for Knoetschkesuchus, chosing routes along larger landmasses in the marine basins such as the Amorican Massif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism would be similar to a postulated faunal interchange between the Early Cretaceous terrestrial fauna in the Lower Saxon Basin and the Wesses-Weald Basin [99].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is equally plausible that the epicontinental sea provided an insurmoutable geographic barrier for such small sized taxa, separating species from each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Progressive uplift of the basin margins in the latest Jurassic caused a change from lagoonal environments like Guimarota and the later carbonate dominated Purbeck facies to fluvial clastics as found in the Wealden facies [96, 97].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could have triggered the evolution of differences in the dentition between the closely related taxa Knoetschkesuchus, and Theriosuchus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the tripartite tooth morphology of Theriosuchus has been compared to the dentition of extant iguanids [67, 100], comprising a mainly entomophagous diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison with Iguana iguana, Brinkmann [67] assumed that Theriosuchus might have equally likely had a herbivorous component in its diet, which was corroborated by the study of Ãsi [101].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been suggested by Young et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2015 [78] that the different tooth morphologies in atoposaurids might be indicative for dietary specializations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that in concert with the changing paleoenvironment, the development of a specialized dentition in Theriosuchus would have allowed the animals to respond to the environmental changes and to realize particular niches different to those realized by Knoetschkesuchus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular the type species Theriosuchus pusillus derives from an extremely diverse crocodyliform paleocommunity [26, 27], where specialization to a certain type of well available food such as insects, or the addition of plant material into the diet might have been an ecological advantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential niche partitioning in the Early Cretaceous crocodyliform community of Western Europe suggested by Tennant & Mannion [83] is supported by our finds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphological diversity of dentition was described to be a potential driver of the evolution of atoposaurids in the Middle to Late Jurassic by Young et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [78] and would be consistent with the ecological, biogeographical and taxonomical variation of taxa hitherto associated with Theriosuchus and Knoetschkesuchus as described herein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
