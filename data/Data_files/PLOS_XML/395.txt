From Clinging to Digging: The Postembryonic Skeletal Ontogeny of the Indian Purple Frog, Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis (Anura: Nasikabatrachidae)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Indian Purple frog, Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis, occupies a basal phylogenetic position among neobatrachian anurans and has a very unusual life history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tadpoles have a large ventral oral sucker, which they use to cling to rocks in torrents, whereas metamorphs possess adaptations for life underground.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The developmental changes that underlie these shifts in habits and habitats, and especially the internal remodeling of the cranial and postcranial skeleton, are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a nearly complete metamorphic series from free-living larva to metamorph, we describe the postembryonic skeletal ontogeny of this ancient and unique monotypic lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The torrent-dwelling larva possesses a dorsoventrally flattened body and a head with tiny dorsal eyes, robust lower and upper jaw cartilages, well-developed trabecular horns, and a definable gap between the trabecular horns and the tip of the snout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike tadpoles of many other frogs, those of Nasikabatrachus retain larval mouthparts into late metamorphic stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unusual feature enables the larvae to maintain their clinging habit until near the end of metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent ontogenetic shift from clinging to digging is correlated with rapid morphological changes and behavioral modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metamorphs are equipped with a shortened tibiafibula and ossified prehallical elements, which likely facilitate initial digging using the hind limbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the frogs may shift to headfirst burrowing by using the wedge-shaped skull, anteriorly positioned pectoral girdle, well-developed humeral crests and spatula-shaped forelimbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition from an aquatic life in torrents to a terrestrial life underground entails dramatic changes in skeletal morphology and function that represent an extreme in metamorphic remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis enhances the scope for detailed comparative studies across anurans, a group renowned for the diversity of its life history strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis, the sole known representative of Nasikabatrachidae, the most recently discovered frog family, is endemic to the Western Ghats of India [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Termed the coelacanth of frogs in reference to its surprising discovery in 2003 and its distant phylogenetic relationship to most other living frogs [2], Nasikabatrachus provides a window into the early history of anurans and gives insight into the evolution of advanced frogs, the neobatrachians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As adults, Nasikabatrachus shares a stout body, sturdy limbs and tiny eyes with several burrowing frogs from disparate lineages, and its phylogenetic relationships have been controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its closest living relatives were originally considered to be the Sooglossidae, a family of frogs known only from the Seychelles, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, with a divergence time of 130 my [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are, however, several morphological dissimilarities between the two families as well as striking differences in their reproductive biology, which might argue against a close relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, Scott [3] proposed Nasikabatrachidae to be more closely related to the Hemisotidae (comprising a single genus, Hemisusthe African purple-nosed frogs) on the basis of external morphology, while Frost et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4] relegated Nasikabatrachidae a synonym of Sooglossidae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of detailed morphological data led to the further speculation of Nasikabatrachus being a hemisotid or a microhylid [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent phylogenetic studies reaffirm the sister-group relationship between Nasikabatrachidae and Sooglossidae while emphasizing that Nasikabatrachus constitutes an independent evolutionary lineage that deserves recognition at the family level [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis has many intriguing features that remain underexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The species has large clinging tadpoles that inhabit torrents [9], while metamorphs dig directly into the soil and lead a secretive life underground [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults are among the largest digging frogs and emerge with the onset of the rainy season to breed in mountain streams [9,10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tadpoles use their mouths for feeding, for attachment and for locomotion across submerged boulders in torrents or on the sharp rocky inclines of rheophilic habitats [9,11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their oral discs are relatively large, which maximizes both area of attachment and attachment force [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While attached, they feed using keratinized teeth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult Nasikabatrachus are active diggers that share several specialized external adaptations with other digging frogs, including small yet sturdy heads, small mouths and powerful limbs [1,12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults were not observedand remained formally undescribeduntil recently, in part because of their extremely secretive fossorial habit [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the very conspicuous tadpoles have been collected by naturalists and utilized by forest-people long before they were scientifically described [13,14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nasikabatrachus tadpoles begin to dig at Gosner stages 4445, before metamorphosis is complete and when the residual tail is still being resorbed [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They appear to spend the metamorphic climax underground.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we describe the metamorphic transformation of the cartilaginous and bony skeleton of Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis based on a nearly complete series of free-living stages from suctorial tadpole to early digging metamorph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We especially highlight the autapomorphies and characters convergent with other digging species, thus contributing to the comparative analysis of anuran skeletal development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ethics_statement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study was conducted with permissions and guidelines from the responsible authorities in the State Forest Departments, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocol of our collection and research complied with the ethical conditions under the provision of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, Government of India.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific methods of collection, euthanasia, tissue sampling and fixation followed the guidelines for use of live amphibians and reptiles in field research by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (ASIH) (http://www.asih.org/pubs/herpcoll.html; dated 13 March 2006), and were approved by the internal ethical committee of Department of Environmental Studies, University of Delhi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Field_surveys_and_specimen_collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Field collection of tadpoles at Methotti, Kulamaav (09°4920.83N, 76°5329.60E, 560 m asl) was made by AT and SDB during the monsoon season, between April and September 20082013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tadpoles were randomly sampled from streams to minimize location effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following collection, tadpoles were immediately euthanized by immersion in tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were subsequently preserved in 70% ethanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

External_morphology_of_the_tadpole_stages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preserved tadpoles were staged according to Gosner [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tadpoles of Nasikabatrachus have a distinctive ventromedial vent-tube with a triangular flap that can obscure the developing hind limb bud.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During staging, the flap was deflected with a needle and blue ink applied to assess the limbs relative development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tadpoles were measured as in Altig [16] and Altig & McDiarmid [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following external measurements were made to the nearest 0.1 mm by using a digital caliper or a binocular microscope fitted with an ocular micrometer (S1 Table): maximum height of body (BH), maximum length of body (BL), maximum width of body (BW), maximum diameter of eye (ED), internarial distance (NN), naro-pupillar distance (NP), interpupillar distance (PP), rostro-narial distance (RN), distance from tip of snout to opening of spiracle (SS), distance from tip of snout to insertion of upper tail fin (SU), snout-vent length (SVL), total length (TL), distance from vent to tip of tail (VT), tail muscle height (TMH) and tail muscle width (TMW).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens are deposited in the Systematics Lab, University of Delhi (SDBDU), under accession numbers SDB 10041073.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Osteology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Osteological preparations and descriptions are based on 69 specimens representing Gosner stages 2546.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All specimens were skinned, eviscerated and differentially stained for bone and cartilage [18], except for one stage-30 specimen that was only stained for cartilage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial dehydration in absolute ethanol was followed by cartilage staining using Alcian blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens were then macerated with trypsin dissolved in 30% aqueous sodium borate, stained for bone using Alizarin red dissolved in 0.5% aqueous KOH, and cleared and ultimately preserved in glycerin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All specimens were scored for bone within one day following staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When necessary, cleared-and-stained larvae were dissected carefully to observe individual bones and cartilages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A given bone was scored as present based on the presence of calcified (reddish-colored) bone matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of calcified endolymph, which also stained red, was recorded separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separate ossification indices for cranial and postcranial elements were calculated for each stage: ossification index = number of bones present at a given stage/total number of bones present at stage 46 (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cleared and stained specimens were photographed with a Nikon SMZ 800 zoom-stereomicroscope with a digital microscope camera (DS-Fi1) and standalone control unit (DL-L3), or with a Canon 60D digital camera with Canon EF 100 mm macro lens or Canon MP-E 65 x1-5 dedicated macro lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cartilage terminology follows Cannatella [19] and Hanken & Hall [20]; bone terminology follows Trueb [21], Duellman & Trueb [22], Pugener & Maglia [23,24], Maglia et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [25] and Pugener et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A nearly complete ontogenetic series of tadpoles, lacking only Gosner stages 34 and 40, was examined (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For brevity, only stages 25, 26, 30, 31, 33, 36, 38, 42, 44, 45 and 46 are described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Description of the neurocranium and the first visceral arch at stage 30 is followed by the morphology of a stage-46 metamorph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage 30, which lacks adult nasal cartilages, provides a baseline for evaluating the cartilage remodeling and ossification of subsequent stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resolving the morphology of the hyoid skeleton in cleared-and-stained whole mounts of the heavily muscularized larvae of Nasikabatrachus proved difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the hyolaryngeal skeleton is described only for stage 46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Larval_neurocranium_and_the_first_visceral_arch_(stage_30)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Description of the larval neurocranium is based on four stage-30 tadpoles (Fig 1A1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average width of the cranium equals 99% of its length (N = 4); the greatest width is attained at the level of the muscular processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trabecular horns extend from the ethmoid plate and are relatively long46% of chondrocranial length (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The horns are uniform in width but diverge anteriorly, resulting in a V-shape with an angle of 74° with the ethmoid plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lateral process arises from the lateral margin of each trabecular horn near its base.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anteriorly, each trabecular horn curves to articulate with lateral alae and central corpus of the suprarostral (upper jaw) cartilage on the same side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The single suprarostral cartilage is oriented dorsoventrally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It comprises a medial corpus bordered laterally by two well-defined, triangular alae (Fig 1A1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsal and ventral margins of the suprarostral are complete; anterolateral margins articulate with the posteriorly curved anterior ends of the trabecular horns via synovial joints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pair of well-developed adrostral cartilages are present dorsal, lateral and posterior to the posterior margin of the suprarostral alae (Fig 1A and 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paired, wedge-shaped infrarostral cartilages are joined medially by a cartilaginous commissura intramandibularis, and each infrarostral articulates anterolaterally with an L-shaped Meckels cartilage (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ramaswami [27] describes from serial sections a second connective-tissue attachment between infrarostral and Meckels cartilages of a given side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could not discern this connective tissue in whole mounts, but in other species the component, which also is termed commissura intramandibularis, is often discernible only in sections [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each Meckels cartilage articulates posteriorly with the articular process of the palatoquadrate and is positioned obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the neurocranium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The paired palatoquadrate cartilages are located lateral to the braincase and are concave in dorsal view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anterior margin of each articular process (pars articularis quadrati [26]) overlaps the posterior margin of Meckels cartilage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arcus subocularis (suborbital cartilage [26]) is roughly spherical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The palatoquadrate is expanded at its anterolateral margin, giving rise to a reduced muscular process and quadratocranial commissure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apex of the muscular process lies anterior to the quadratocranial commissure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anterior portion of the arcus subocularis gives rise to the hyoquadrate process ventrally, which articulates with the ceratohyal cartilage of the hyobranchial skeleton (not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ascending process articulates with the lateral braincase wall slightly dorsal to the oculomotor foramen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A flat, plate-like otic process is present at the posterolateral corner of the palatoquadrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The muscular process has a ligamentous attachment to the processus antorbitalis of the lamina orbitonasalis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A cartilaginous nasal septum separates the paired nasal capsules and merges posteriorly with the tectum nasi, which roofs the nasal capsules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tectum nasi arise laterally as rounded projections that are located dorsally to the anterior quadratocranial commissure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lamina orbitonasalis comprises a small triangular projection medial to the anterior quadratocranial commissure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frontoparietal fenestra is undivided and bordered by the taenia tecti marginalis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fenestra is 36% of the total length of the chondrocranium and widest at the anterior margin of the otic capsules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taenia tecti transversalis and taenia tecti medialis are absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Laryngeal_apparatus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A partially developed laryngeal apparatus is situated between the posteromedial processes of the hyoid skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It comprises a pair of hemi-spherical arytenoid cartilages and a pair of incomplete cricoid cartilages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arytenoids are broader than the cricoid cartilages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anterior-most end of each cricoid cartilage expands to form an irregular-shaped bronchial process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unique post-hatching ontogeny of Nasikabatrachus includes an abrupt metamorphosis from a torrent-dwelling, clinging larva to a fossorial froglet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the shift to an underground microhabitat is completed even before metamorphic climax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We document several characters and ontogenetic patterns that provide a structural framework for this dramatic transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also reveal character convergence with larval and adult frogs of disparate lineages that have similar habits and occupy similar habitats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generalized, stream-dwelling tadpoles use their tails to swim and their suctorial mouths to browse on suspended and stationary food [17,22,29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a torrent habitat, however, free-floating food is accessible to only the most agile swimmers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, torrent-dwelling tadpoles typically feed on stationary food sources such as aufwuchs associated with submerged boulders or algae growing on exposed boulders in splash zones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To feed on these firmly attached food sources, torrent-inhabiting tadpoles typically have the oral disc modified to serve as a ventral sucker, which is supported by a specialized cartilaginous skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Suctorial tadpoles have evolved in several disparate neobatrachian lineages in response to the similar ecological challenges posed by fast-flowing streams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stream-dwelling Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis are characterized by dorsoventrally flattened bodies, heavy muscularized tails, a medial vent-tube with a triangular flap, robust serrated jaw sheaths and suctorial mouthparts with marginal and submarginal papillae [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suctorial larvae (stages 2543) of N. sahyadrensis share this condition with Ascaphus truei [3032], Heleophryne spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [27], Hyla claresignata [33], Litoria and Nyctimystes [34], and Amolopus and Ansonia [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ramaswami [27] identified the torrent-dwelling tadpoles initially reported by Annandale [36], now known to be N. sahyadrensis, ascystignathids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing these tadpoles with those of Heleophryne, he speculated that torrent-dwelling larvae might resemble one another externally but not internally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He reported trabecular horns absent in Heleophryne but present in cystignathids; the processus ascendens absent in Heleophryne but present in cystignathids; and operculum development during metamorphosis in Heleophryne but during premetamorphosis in cystignathids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Haas & Richards [34] conclude that suctorial tadpoles show convergence of both external and internal features; these include expanded trabecular horns, robust infrarostrals, fusion of the suprarostrals, a robust palatoquadrate and an enlarged ventral process of the palatoquadrate for articulartion with the orbitohyoideus muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we show that the chondrocranium of N. sahyadrensis shares several conspicuous features with those of other lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Nasikabatrachus, a well-developed larval chondrocranium persists from stage 25 until stage 44, when the skull undergoes a dramatic metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trabecular horns are narrow, elongate and possess anteriorly truncated tips; they diverge anteriorly to support the well-developed upper jaws (suprarostral cartilage).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attachment of the trabecular horns to the suprarostral via both its central corpus and lateral alaea synapomorphy in bufonids, dendrobatids and hylids [37]is also seen in Nasikabatrachus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, a pair of well-developed adrostral cartilages adjacent to the posterior and lateral ends of the suprarostral also is a conspicuous feature of many other suctorial tadpoles, including Litoria nannotis, L. rheocola and L. dayi [34], Rhinella quechua [38], and Heleophryne, Megophrys and Spea [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that this feature evolved independently in Nasikabatrachus, a phylogenetically basal lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haas & Richards [34] propose that, in Litoria, each adrostral functions as a pushing rod which transmits force to the suprarostral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional study is needed to see if the same functional mechanism applies to the convergently evolved adrostral cartilages in N. sahyadrensis and other disparate lineages of neobatrachians that inhabit fast-flowing streams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lower jaws are robust in N. sahyadrensis, Hyla claresignata [33], Litoria and Nyctimystes [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such altered proportions of underlying jaw cartilages and trabecular horns may serve to buttress the enlarged mouthparts and suctorial discs of torrent-dwelling tadpoles [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the adherent oral discs aid in the hitching movement of larvae over the substrate [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A robust palatoquadrate with broad anterior quadratocranial commissure and well-developed posterior articular process is present in Hyla claresignata [33], Litoria and Nyctimystes [34], as well as in Nasikabatrachus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Suctorial larvae have shovel-shaped, depressed bodies, which help them press against or even attach to submerged rocks and boulders and resist strong currents [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small dorsal eyes, which facilitate aerial vision when moving along rocks, are also characteristic of suctorial tadpoles [35], as is a considerable gap between the rostral end of the trabecular horns and the tip of the snout, which is often filled with a semi-gelatinous tissue and may function as a shock absorber [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features are also present in Nasikabatrachus (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151114.g007  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transition from a torrent-dwelling, clinging larva to a metamorphosed adult presents a broken or greatly damaged ontogenetic sequence whereby larval mouthparts are retained into late developmental stages when compared to the metamorphosis of a typical tadpole, in which loss of larval mouthparts is congruent with absorption of the tail [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the tadpoles of N. sahyadrensis age and move towards the edges of streams, dramatic modifications of chondrocrania occur rapidly and osteogenesis of postcranial and cranial elements coincide with the new requirements of their burrowing lifestyle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This metamorphic pattern resembles those of other torrent-dwellers such as Amolops, Ansonia [35] and Ascaphus truei [40,41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A hitching action, whereby tadpoles of Nasikabatrachus in splash zones scrape algae from rocks covered by a thin film of water, is observed during stages 2644 [914].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same behavior is reported for Ansonia longidigita and Amolops orphnocnemis [35], Adenomus kandianus [42], Bokermannohyla claresignata [33], Ascaphus truei [30,31], Ghatophryne ornata [9] and Rhinella quechua [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metamorphosis is a vulnerable period for most anuran larvae due to the substantial developmental rearrangements and associated changes in habits and habitats that occur during that time [43,44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that light, persisting within the splash zone, a microhabitat that offers protection from both strong stream currents and aquatic predation, until the well-developed tail is absorbed may be of considerable survival value [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Nasikabatrachus, rapid loss of the specialized larval mouthparts and suctorial oral disc coincides with the onset of fossoriality at stage 45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metamorphs spend little time moving between these two specialized and protective habitats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cartilaginous lower and upper jaws are retained into late metamorphic stages (4344; Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There also is a lag in the elongation of Meckels cartilage and corresponding increase in the size of the gape (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By stage 44 all postcranial elements are well ossified in comparison to cranial elements (Table 1 and S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shift to a fossorial life involves additional internal and external transformations that enhance digging and feeding abilities in this new zone of safety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently metamorphosed Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis (stages 4546) migrate towards the banks of streams where they begin to burrow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They possess stout bodies accommodating adaptations for burrowing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include large frontoparietals and nasals, which are extensively ossified and almost completely cover the cranium dorsally; both features are considered plesiomorphic for burrowing anurans [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As is true for nearly all species of digging frogs, Nasikabatrachus digs predominantly with its hind feet (the remaining species dig headfirst [45]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frogs push against the substrate with their hind feet, often concentrating the force in the vicinity of the metatarsal tubercle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In N. sahyadrensis, well-ossified prehallical elements of the strong metatarsal tubercles (Figs 2J and 6K, Table 1) presumably are used as spades to shift soil [45,46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shortened tibiafibula (19% of SVL) enhances the force of the metatarsal tubercle during digging [45] and may facilitate quadrupedal locomotion (walking) underground [45,47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emerson [45] speculated that well-developed humeral crests and robust humeri enable attachment of broad pectoral and forelimb muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both features are present in burrowing forms such as Hemisus and Glyphoglossus [45] and in N. sahyadrensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pectoral girdle of Nasikabatrachus is located at the rostral-most end of the trunk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it partially overlaps the prootics and exoccipitals at the caudal end of the skull (Figs 2F and 3C), a convergent feature that is shared with other burrowers such as Hemisus (headfirst [45]) and Rhinophrynus dorsalis (hind-feetfirst [46]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased anterior deployment of the pectoral girdle provides a mechanical-coupling with the body, thus providing increased surface area for attachment of pectoral musculature [45] and possibly increasing maneuverability of the forelimbs involved in forward movement [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This anterior placement of the pectoral girdle has been used as one of the prominent characters of headfirst burrowers (Glyphoglossus molossus [45]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though Nasikabatrachus uses its hind feet to initiate burrowing, it may move through the soil headfirst, especially when searching for food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A wedge-shaped skull with a thick epidermal knob at the tip of the pointed snout and forelimbs with well-ossified prepollical elements likely would facilitate forward movement underground, which would be useful for locating new food sources and refuges (as also noted for Rhinophrynus dorsalis [46]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In larval Nasikabatrachus, endolymphatic sacs invade the extradural space of both the cranium and the vertebral column; they extend posteriorly to the sacrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nasikabatrachus possesses type V endolymphatic sacs, which are large and lie in the extradural space of both the endocranial and vertebral cavities [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They develop and expand as larval development progresses (Fig 4A4F) but persist even in well-developed metamorphs (stages 4546; Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sacs are made of aragonite, a form of calcium carbonate [22,48] and likely represent an important source of calcium for bone formation during and after metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study provides material for comparative analyses with other anurans as well as insights into the varied survival strategies of amphibians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two highly specialized life history stages of Nasikabatrachus, clinging tadpoles and burrowing adults, display many peculiar features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relic from the Jurassic era reminds us that extreme specialization can be an effective survival strategy over evolutionary time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
