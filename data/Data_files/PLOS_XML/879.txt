Dynamic Cholesterol-Conditioned Dimerization of the G Protein Coupled Chemokine Receptor Type 4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) allow for the transmission of signals across biological membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a number of GPCRs, this signaling was shown to be coupled to prior dimerization of the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) was reported before to form dimers and their functionality was shown to depend on membrane cholesterol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we address the dimerization pattern of CXCR4 in pure phospholipid bilayers and in cholesterol-rich membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using ensembles of molecular dynamics simulations, we show that CXCR4 dimerizes promiscuously in phospholipid membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of cholesterol dramatically affects the dimerization pattern: cholesterol binding largely abolishes the preferred dimer motif observed for pure phospholipid bilayers formed mainly by transmembrane helices 1 and 7 (TM1/TM5-7) at the dimer interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, the symmetric TM3,4/TM3,4 interface is enabled first by intercalating cholesterol molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data provide a molecular basis for the modulation of GPCR activity by its lipid environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The G protein coupled C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is a transmembrane receptor that plays an essential role in the human immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, overexpression of CXCR4 has been shown to lead to metastasis of breast and lung cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the HI-Virus infects T-cells through binding to CXCR4 resulting in immunodeficiency and AIDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function of CXCR4 as well as its interaction with HIV depends on the presence of cholesterol in the cell membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, dimerization of CXCR4 is considered to be functionally relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using more than a thousand of molecular dynamics simulations, we aim to connect the cholesterol-modulated function of CXCR4 with a potentially cholesterol-conditioned dimerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that the dimerization pattern of CXCR4 is drastically altered by cholesterol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we suggest that a functionally competent CXCR4 dimer is exclusively formed in the presence of cholesterol, while the preferred CXCR4 dimer interface in the absence of cholesterol is shifted to probably inactive forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Signaling across cell barriers by G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) is increasingly associated with GPCR dimerization or more general oligomerization [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While G protein coupling was shown for many GPCRs to not necessarily depend on dimerization, a direct coupling of function with homo- or hetero-dimerization was reported for a number of GPCRs from both class A and class C [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is supposed to form dimers for proper biological activity [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This class A GPCR is responsible for directed migration of cells (chemotaxis) in nerve and immune cells of the human body [6, 7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overexpression of CXCR4 has been shown to lead to metastasis [8] and increased levels of CXCR4 expression were in particular found in breast and lung cancer cells [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, CXCR4 is known to be a major receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) upon infecting human T-cells leading to immunodeficiency and AIDS [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXCR4 dimers have been suggested to be either preformed, induced, or stabilized by the interaction with its agonist CXCL12 [5, 1113].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Function of CXCR4 requires the presence of cholesterol [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cholesterol may influence CXCR4 function by either inducing conformational changes upon binding or by cholesterol-altered CXCR4 dimerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, no direct proofs for either of those mechanisms exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cancer cells, the chemotaxis response following CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 was abolished, inhibiting CXCR4-mediated cell migration, if the receptor homodimerization was modulated by removing cholesterol or blocked by a TM4 peptide (an analog of the transmembrane (TM) helix 4 of CXCR4) [14, 15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another study revealed that the CXCL12-induced increase of the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-signal intensity, was greatly reduced in presence of TM4 peptides in living cells, whereas TM6 and TM7 peptides showed significantly weaker influence [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, CXCR4-mediated inhibition of cAMP production was almost abolished due to the binding of TM4 peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations hint to a mechanism where dimeric interfaces involving TM4 enable ligand-induced conformational changes which are required for CXCR4 signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, the dimerization of wildtype CXCR4 with a truncated form was shown to cause the WHIM (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections and Myelokathexis) syndrome [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structural information on GPCR dimerization or oligomerization interfaces mainly comes from available crystal structures of class A GPCRs [18, 19] displaying preferred interfaces under crystal conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different dimer interfaces were found for various receptors: the transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) and helix 8 (H8) form the symmetric dimer interface of opsin [20] and of the human 2-adrenergic GPCR [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TM1 and TM2 as well as H8 were found at the symmetric interface of the human  opioid receptor [22], and TM1,7 and H8 for rhodopsin [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the latter, atomic force microscopy data further hinted to TM4,5 as the physiological interface [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) a crystal packing with an asymmetric interface including TM1,7 and H8 on one monomer and TM4,5 for the second was obtained [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some receptors even displayed different dimer configurations in different crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E.g., for the 1-adrenergic GPCR both symmetric TM1,2,H8 as well as TM4,5 interfaces were observed [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also the high-resolution crystal structures of CXCR4 in complex with either a small antagonist (IT1t), a cyclic antagoinst (CVX15), or a viral chemokine antagonist (vMIP-II) showed symmetric TM5,6 interfaces as the dominant dimerization interfaces [17, 27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CXCR4 dimers were likewise formed by TM1/TM5-7 interactions, or displayed TM1/TM1 as a dimerization interface (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005169.g001  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another important source of information about GPCR dimerization are in silico molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coarse-grained (CG) simulations allow to study GPCR self-assembly on the microsecond timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two commonly used techniques to obtain a statistical view on the oligomerization process include simulations of multiple receptors [28, 29] and multiple independent parallel dimerization or oligomerization simulations [2931].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These in silico methods have shown that individual GPCRs may interact by different interfaces and suggested for the 2-adrenergic receptor a possible modulation of the dimer interface by cholesterol [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of GPCR dimer interfaces may be approximated by analyzing the potential of mean force [32, 33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This methodology has shown that both the 1- and 2-adrenergic receptors prefer the symmetric TM1,H8 dimerization interface over the also symmetric TM3,4 interface [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rhodopsin also mostly favors the TM1,H8 interface, followed closely by symmetric TM5 and TM4,5 interfaces [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A coupling between GPCR function and dimer interface configuration was first shown by cross linking experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These revealed that the homodimer interface of the dopamine receptor (class A GPCR) differs considerably between active (TM4/TM4) and inactive (TM4,5/TM4,5) states of the receptor [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR, class C GPCR) adopts different dimer configurations depending on whether the receptor is in its active (TM6/TM6) or inactive (TM4,5/TM4,5) state [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differently, the serotonine receptor (5HT2c, class A GPCR) was found to form both TM1/TM1 and TM4,5/TM4,5 dimers, however, only the latter dimer was activation sensitive [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While evidence for a coupling of GPCR function and dimerization is increasing, it is not known whether activation selects between different pre-existing GPCR dimer configurations or whether activation drives a reorientation of the receptors in a dimer into an activation-compatible state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A couple of recent crystal structures revealed intercalating cholesterol molecules within assembled GPCR oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of the A2A adenosine receptor, three cholesterol molecules from the upper membrane leaflet were reported to intercalate at the TM1-TM3/TM5,6 dimer interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cholesterol molecules were bound between TM2 and TM3 and closely packed around TM6 of the protomers [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symmetric TM5,6/TM5,6 dimer interface of the P2Y12 receptor was stabilized by two cholesterol molecules from the lower leaflet which intercalate between TM3 and TM5 of the protomers [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the antagonist-bound, (and thus considered inactive) -opioid receptors shows a symmetric dimer interface involving TM5, TM6 and cholesterol bound to TM6 [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also for the agonist-bound receptor, in orchestra with a G protein mimetic fragment coupled to the intracellular part, a cholesterol molecule bound to TM6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the dimerization via symmetric TM5,6 interactions was disabled due to the outwards movement of the lower part of TM6 [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the symmetric TM1,2,H8/TM1,2,H8 dimer (also formed in the inactive state) could still be observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations from different GPCR dimer structures further support the hypothesis that GPCR dimer interfaces may differ between active and inactive configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, cholesterol binding appears to be receptor specific and thus hard to classify in a general way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we report a combined coarse-grained and atomistic simulation study of the dimerization of the chemokine receptor type 4, showing a promiscuous, however, specific binding pattern of CXCR4 in a phospholipid bilayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study further pinpoints how cholesterol binding to a specific binding site on TM1,7 largely suppresses the formation of a dimer interface involving TM6, which was reported to be essential in receptor activation [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, cholesterol-rich domains are shown to favor a symmetrical TM3,4 dimer interface of CXCR4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings connect the experimental observations that CXCR4 signaling is cholesterol-dependent and that the TM4 helix is a key player in building up signaling-competent homodimer interfaces in a molecular manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dimerization of CXCR4 in absence and presence of cholesterol was studied using ensembles of MD simulations at a coarse-grained level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we performed 1,500 coarse-grained simulations of two CXCR4 monomers embedded in a phospholipid bilayer built of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) molecules at 0%, 10%, and 30% cholesterol content [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The receptors were initially separated by at least 3.5 nm, the simulation lengths were 3 s (0% cholesterol) and 6 s (10% and 30% cholesterol) for every simulation, accumulating to a total simulation time of 7.5 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Promiscuous_dimerization_of_CXCR4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dimerization of CXCR4 in pure POPC was observed in  50% of all simulations within 3 s (For a sample dimerization process see S1 Video).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of cholesterol led to a markedly decreased dimerization: Association was obtained in 29% of all simulations at 10% cholesterol concentration, and only 10% of the systems dimerized at 30% cholesterol content within 3 s (145 and 53 simulations resulting in dimer formation, respectively, (see S1 Fig)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 6 s of simulation time, 55% and 21% of the simulation systems at 10% and 30% cholesterol content, respectively, showed dimerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that the decrease in dimerization can not be attributed to the decrease in protein mobility only: cholesterol reduced the diffusion coefficient of a monomeric receptor only by 25% and 50% (for 10% and 30% cholesterol, respectively), compared to a corresponding decrease in dimerization by 42% and 79% (see Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, assuming a simple hit-and-dimerize model, a reduced diffusion coefficient would lead to a proportionally decreased receptor dimerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that cholesterol affects dimerization either by changing the membrane properties or by direct interaction with the receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all dimerization simulations, the receptor did not substantially affect the membrane thickness in its surrounding, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the lipid bilayer frustration [42] is expected to be of minor importance for the dimerization in the POPC systems (compare S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few dissociation events of CXCR4 dimers could be observed, allowing to estimate a lower bound for the binding free energy between -20 kJ/mol (30% cholesterol) and -24 kJ/mol (pure POPC, see Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, an orientation analysis of the monomers in the sampled dimer structures revealed seven different dimer configurations (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most populated dimers in pure POPC were a compact asymmetric TM1/TM5-7 dimer (configuration B, population 26%), a TM1/TM5 dimer (C, 24%), a loosely bound configuration via terminal TM5/TM5 contacts (A, 20%), and a symmetric TM1/TM1 dimer (D, 13%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interconversions between initially formed dimer interfaces were hardly observed with the exception of transitions between interfaces B and C (compare S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most populated dimer configuration B (TM1/TM5-7) is in excellent agreement with one of the available CXCR4 dimer crystal structures (marked as blue spots in Fig 2a, root mean square deviation, RMSD, 3.9 Å, for a molecular view see Fig 3): The crystal structure (pdb entry 3OE8 [17]) has a symmetric TM5,6/TM5,6 interface in a trimeric complex, but also contains an interface formed by TM1 of one monomer and residues of TM5, TM6, and TM7 of the second receptor (Figs 1b and 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, at the N-terminal side of the receptor, Lys38 (TM1) and the aromatic Phe276 form a -H pair and Ile261 (TM6) interacts with the backbone of Lys38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central part of the interaction interface is built up by hydrophobic interactions between leucines at positions 50 (TM1) and 253 (TM6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contacts between Val54, Leu58, and Val62 of TM1 and Leu216, Cys220, Ile223, and Ser224 of TM5 complete this dimeric CXCR4 interface at the C-terminal side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second most populated dimer configuration (C) contains an asymmetric TM1/TM5 interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar interface was reported for the CCR5 chemokine receptor [25], although there TM4 contributed as well to the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symmetric TM1/TM1 interface (observed for 13% of all spontaneously formed dimers in pure POPC, D) is also seen in the contact region between two TM5,6/TM5,6 dimers in the crystal structure (compare Fig 1b, pdb entry 3OE9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dimer interface is mainly built by Thr43 and Ile47 of each receptor (RMSD between crystal and simulated TM1/TM1 amounts to 4.1 Å, Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to the well reproduced TM1/TM5-7 and TM1/TM1 crystal dimers, the rather compact TM5,6/TM5,6 crystal interface was not sampled in the simulations regardless of the cholesterol concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of this dimer interface was found to be hindered by significant differences in the tilt of TM5 between the monomeric CXCR4 form (tilt of upper part of TM5, Asp193-Met205, 28°; lower part of TM5, Val206-Ser227, 35°) and the TM5,6/TM5,6 crystal dimer (tilts of 12° and 22°, respectively), a result that was obtained independent of the membrane thickness (S2 Fig, S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I.e., under crystallization conditions the TM5 helix in the symmetric TM5,6 dimer is oriented more parallel to the (hypothetical) membrane normal as compared to CXCR4 monomers in a phospholipid membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that the formation of the crystal compact TM5,6/TM5,6 dimer in biological membranes requires either prior or induced receptor tilting upon dimerization or conformational receptor rearrangements resulting in an altered TM5 tilt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, atomistic simulations of the crystal TM5,6/TM5,6 dimer showed an asymmetric orientation of the TM5 helix at the interface, suggesting a reduced stability of the crystal TM5,6/TM5,6 CXCR4 dimer symmetry in a membrane environment (S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A different picture emerges for the TM1/TM5-7 and TM1/TM1 dimer configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the TM5 helices of the simulated crystal dimers adopt similar orientations to those observed in CXCR4 monomer simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cholesterol-conditioned_changes_of_the_CXCR4_dimerization_interface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of cholesterol in the lipid bilayer significantly affected the preference for the formation of different dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the population of dimer A (loose TM5/TM5 dimer) was only slightly affected, the population of dimers including helices TM1 and TM5-7 (dimers B, C, and D) decreased significantly with increasing cholesterol concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At high cholesterol concentration, the formation of dimers B and D (found in crystal structures) is impeded resulting in relative populations of only  5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, in the presence of cholesterol dimers interacting via the TM3,4 interface (dimers F, G) are substantially enhanced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance of the asymmetric dimer G (TM1,7/TM3-5 interface) was already enhanced at 10% cholesterol content while the occupancy of the symmetric dimer F (TM3,4/TM3,4), hardly sampled in a pure POPC membrane ( 1%), increased to  20% at high cholesterol concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in the dimerization profile were largely induced by specific cholesterol-receptor interactions (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The function of several G protein coupled receptors was shown before to be coupled to dimerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent pieces of evidence further prompted to the existence of multiple dimer interfaces, and the selective importance of individual interfaces for signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, crystallographic studies suggest that GPCRs may adopt type-specific dimer configurations, despite their structural similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, based on ensembles of dimerization simulations, a high plasticity of the dimer interface of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 is reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three compact dimer structures emerged as main configurations in a cholesterol-free membrane, involving a TM1/TM5-7 interface, a TM1/TM5 interface, as well as a symmetric TM1/TM1 configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the symmetric and compact dimer including helices TM5 and partially TM6, predominant in crystals of the receptor, could not be reproduced in the membrane environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for this difference could be ascribed to the different orientations of the TM5 helix in the membrane-embedded CXCR4 monomer and the crystal TM5,6/TM5,6 dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In cholesterol-depleted membranes CXCR4 is known to be inactive [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GPCR activation and desensitization are connected with movements of TM6 and TM7, respectively [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in the absence of cholesterol, the involvement of these helices in the dimerization interface, as reported here, is likely to hinder their activation-related movements resulting in chemotaxis-inactive dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation is further supported by a FRET study [15] that reported only a small reduction of FRET signals (1520%) between CXCR4 proteins upon depletion of cholesterol, while the CXCR4 chemotaxis response to CXCL12 was completely abolished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either the binding of the CXCL12 ligand (or its dimer) is disabled or the G protein signaling is disrupted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Addition of cholesterol drastically affected the dimerization pattern: The cholesterol binding between TM1 and TM7 mostly disabled the formation of the TM1/TM5-7 dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, a new cholesterol-induced symmetric TM3,4 dimer was enabled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This novel TM3,4 CXCR4 binding mode in cholesterol-rich membranes is corroborated by the experimental finding that addition of TM4 peptides weakened CXCR4 interactions and signaling in malignant cells [15]; the binding of TM4 peptides to CXCR4 likely competes with dimerization at this interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional experimental support for the functional role of dimerization for signaling is provided by earlier work of Percheranicer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  on HEK cells: Using BRET the authors demonstrated a CXCL12-induced rearrangement of CXCR4 homodimers coupled to the activation of the receptor [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TM6 and TM7 peptides did not affect these CXCL12-induced configurational changes, however, addition of these transmembrane peptides significantly lowered the receptor signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together with our results, this experiment may be interpreted as follows: We assume a pool of different dimers, both active or activatable and inactive, formed by CXCR4 in cholesterol containing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon addition of CXCL12 the preformed TM3,4 homodimers are stabilized by the interaction with the ligand, shifting the pool towards this dimer configuration and resulting in the observed increased BRET intensity and receptor signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of TM4 peptides impedes the formation of this complex resulting in drastically decreased BRET intensity and receptor signaling [15, 16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, addition of TM6 and TM7 peptides hardly affect the formation of the activation-competent TM3,4 dimer but probably blocked receptor activation by binding to the activation site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, not the BRET intensity but the activity is influenced by the presence of TM6 or TM7 peptides in the experiment [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn supports the conclusion derived above, that dimers including TM6 at the interaction interface likely represent inactive dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Activation-competent CXCR4 dimers are therefore suggested to necessitate binding via the TM3,4 interface which can only be achieved by cholesterol intercalation as shown here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further validate these findings, a number of experiments could be performed to analyse different aspects of the discussed results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E.g., cross-linking experiments are highly effective in identifying TM helices that contribute to dimeric interfaces and further to test dimer function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar way as performed by Guo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [34], cross-linking different sets of substituted cysteines on distinct TM helices will provide experimental insight in how different dimer interfaces can affect agonist-induced activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding agonists to cross-linked TM1/TM5-7 dimers, should result in reduced CXCR4 signaling as compared to adding agonists to cross-linked TM3,4/TM3,4 dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to address the functionality of cholesterol-induced TM3,4/TM3,4 dimers, mutations of residues on TM3 and TM4 can be introduced that stabilize this interface in the absence of cholesterol, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mutations that insert bulky and hydrophobic residues in order to pad the otherwise cholesterol-filled volume at the interface (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leu166Phe, Thr168Trp or Ile169Phe).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to our observations, CXCR4 signaling is suggested to be less cholesterol-dependent for these mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our results suggest a highly dynamic dimerization pattern for the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and provide evidence for a modulation of the dimerization pattern by the membrane composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with experiments, the total dimerization is only slightly affected by cholesterol while the specificity of the interaction interface and thus probably the signaling capability are drastically altered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All dimerization molecular dynamics simulations were prepared using DAFT [30] and performed with GROMACS 4.6.x [46] using the coarse-grained Martini force field [47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, three CXCR4 (Fig 1a) dimerization assays with 0%, 10%, and 30% cholesterol content in a POPC lipid bilayer were studied, comprising  500 independent simulations each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation lengths were 3 s each for the pure POPC bilayer systems and 6 s for the mixed POPC:cholesterol membranes (consisting of POPC:cholesterol in 9:1 ratio and in 7:3 ratio) in order to account for the reduced diffusion and dimerization kinetics of the receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The orientation of CXCR4 monomers in membranes of varying thickness as well as the preferential cholesterol binding sites were addressed in additional simulations at both CG and atomistic resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, for analysis of the dimer interfaces and lipid-protein interactions selected CG structures were converted back to atomistic resolution [48] and relaxed atomistically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For an overview over all performed CG and atomisitic simulations see Tables 1 and 2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

System_preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dimer crystal structure 3OE0 [17] was obtained from the Protein Data Bank and adjusted in the following way: First, all non-protein atoms, one monomer, and lysozyme (cocrystallizing agent) were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the mutations of residues L125W and T240P, required for crystallization, were mutated back to represent the wild type protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the end, two missing intracellular loops were modelled by MODELLER [49] (The loop comprising K67, K68, L69, and R70 was not resolved in the crystal structure and in place of residues S229 and K230 lysozyme was present in the crystal structure.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MODELLER output structure was energy-minimized using the GROMOS54a7 force field [50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the termini were not resolved in the crystal structure, the final model contained 279 (25303) of the 352 residues of the CXCR4 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The DAFT procedure involved the following steps: First, atomistic structures of CXCR4 were converted to the Martini2.2 CG force field [47] using martinize [47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary and tertiary structure of the protein was assured to be stable by applying a RubberBand network for all backbone bead pairs within the distance of 0.9 nm and excluding the i  i + 1 and i  i + 2 pairs (which are connected by bonds and angles within the Martini force field).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RMSD of the TM helices of CXCR4 was as low as 1.5 Å (500 ns, CHARMM36 force field) or even 1.0 Å (Amber14sb/Lipid14) in atomistic simulations of CXCR4 (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the application of structural restraints in the coarse-grained model is not expected to influence the results on receptor dimerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CG proteins were randomly rotated around the z-axis and placed in pairs with the minimum distance of circumscribed spheres of 3.5 nm into a rhombic box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the next step a CG lipid bilayer [51], either pure POPC or mixed POPC/cholesterol with 9:1 or 7:3 ratio, and CG water [52] were added by insane [53, 54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those systems were then passed to martinate [55] where they underwent 500 steps of steepest-descent energy minimization and 10 ps of position restrained NVT simulation with a 2 fs time step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, 100 ps of MD simulation in an NpT ensemble with a 20 fs time step were performed to heat the system to 310 K and adjust the pressure to 1 bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Production runs succeeded in an NpT ensemble, where the temperature was kept at 310 K by applying the Berendsen thermostat [56] with a 1 ps time constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pressure was controlled in a semi-isotropical manner (xy and z were independent) to 1 bar using the Berendsen barostat [56] with a 3 ps time constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative permittivity was set to be 15 and the electrostatic interactions were shifted to 0 between 0 and 1.2 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The van der Waals forces were described by the 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential that was shifted to zero between 0.9 and 1.2 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integration time step was 20 fs and the movement of the center of mass of the system was removed linearly every 10 steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Atomistic_simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Atomistic simulation systems were set up in Gromacs 5.0.4 [57] by backmapping relaxed coarse-grained systems to an atomistic resolution (either CHARMM36 [58, 59] or Amber14sb/ Lipid14 [6062] force fields) using backward [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of crystal structure simulations the corresponding monomer or dimer crystal structures were fitted on the backmapped structures and energy minimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before production run simulations, 2 ns simulations were performed with position restraints applied on the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final simulation runs were performed in the NpT ensemble, where the temperature was kept constant at 310 K using the v-rescale thermostate [63] with a coupling time constant of 0.5 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pressure was controlled semiisotropically to stay at 1 bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The center of mass motion was removed for the whole simulation system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation of the TM3,4/TM3,4 dimer in POPC with 30% cholesterol content was prepared in GROMACS 4.6.5 using the GROMOS54a7 [50] force field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The particle mesh Ewald summation [64] was applied to compute the long-range electrostatics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further simulation details see Pluhackova et al [65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A summary of all atomistic simulations is given in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
