Individual Differences in Dynamic Functional Brain Connectivity across the Human Lifespan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individual differences in brain functional networks may be related to complex personal identifiers, including health, age, and ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamic network theory has been used to identify properties of dynamic brain function from fMRI data, but the majority of analyses and findings remain at the level of the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we apply hypergraph analysis, a method from dynamic network theory, to quantify individual differences in brain functional dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a summary metric derived from the hypergraph formalismhypergraph cardinalitywe investigate individual variations in two separate, complementary data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first data set (multi-task) consists of 77 individuals engaging in four consecutive cognitive tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that hypergraph cardinality exhibits variation across individuals while remaining consistent within individuals between tasks; moreover, the analysis of one of the memory tasks revealed a marginally significant correspondence between hypergraph cardinality and age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding motivated a similar analysis of the second data set (age-memory), in which 95 individuals, aged 1875, performed a memory task with a similar structure to the multi-task memory task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the increased age range in the age-memory data set, the correlation between hypergraph cardinality and age correspondence becomes significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss these results in the context of the well-known finding linking age with network structure, and suggest that hypergraph analysis should serve as a useful tool in furthering our understanding of the dynamic network structure of the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Complex patterns of activity in each individual human brain generate the unique range of thoughts and behaviors that person experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual differences in ability, age, state of mind, and other characteristics are tied to differences in brain activity, but determination of the exact nature of these relationships has been limited by the intrinsic complexity of the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we apply dynamic network theory to quantify fundamental features of individual neural activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We represent functional connections between brain regions as a time varying network, and then identify groups of these interactions that exhibit similar behavior over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result of this construction is referred to as a hypergraph, and each grouping within the hypergraph is called a hyperedge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the number of these hyperedges in an individuals hypergraph is a trait-like metric, with considerable variation across the population of subjects, but remarkable consistency within each subject as they perform different tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find a significant correspondence between this metric and the subjects age, indicating that the dynamics of functional brain activity in older individuals tends to be more dynamically segregated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new insight into age-related changes in the dynamics of cognitive processing expands our knowledge of the effects of age on brain function and confirms our methods as promising for quantifying and examining individual differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Functional connectivity (FC) analyses based on fMRI data are effective tools for quantifying and characterizing interactions between brain regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many approaches borrow methods from the field of graph theory, in which FC is used to build graphs that model the brain as a complex network, treating brain regions as nodes and using functional connections (pairs of nodes with significantly related BOLD signal dynamics) to determine the edge structure of the network [1, 2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual differences in both underlying FC and the complex network structure resulting from graph theory approaches have been investigated for a variety of task states, developmental stages, and clinical diagnoses [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Certain characteristics of FC have been found to vary consistently over the course of normal human aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of clear segmentation between neural systems is widely reported: many intrinsic functional connectivity networks in the brain tend to become less internally coherent with age, and the functional differences between these intrinsic networks generally become less pronounced [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes are most commonly reported in the default mode network (DMN) [915], although they have also been observed in other networks, including those associated with higher cognitive functions [9, 11, 1416].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, inter-network connectivity between the DMN and other regions of the brain has been found to increase, diminishing the ability to discriminate between networks based on FC [13, 15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are some intrinsic functional networks, however, that show no changes or even increased intra-network connectivity with age, such as sensory networks [10, 12, 14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The bulk of studies on age-related changes and other individual differences in FC, including those that use methods from complex networks and graph theory to represent FC patterns, are performed using static FC analysis, which represents the similarities of brain region activity (or some other measure of concordance) aggregated across an entire data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present investigation, we build upon recent advances in network science to study individual differences in human brain activity and behavior from a dynamic network science perspective [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) extends FC to examine how functional organization evolves over time [18, 19], allowing investigation of the changes in FC during the course of a cognitive task or scanning session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts to probe the dynamics of functional brain networks have revealed that functional structure reconfigures over time in response to task demands [2024] and spontaneously at rest [18, 25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFC methods have also been used to inform understanding of individual differences related to aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, dynamic community structure was found to vary significantly with age [26] and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations of FC (ALFF-FC) was used to show age-dependent changes in the dynamics of interactions between networks [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both studies imply that functional dynamics should be considered when investigating how aging affects brain network organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address this, we use hypergraph analysis, a method from dynamic graph theory, to examine individual differences in DFC network structure in fMRI data acquired as subjects perform cognitively demanding tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method is based on a generalization of standard graph theoretical techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, by defining the standard node-node FC graph in successive temporal epochs, we construct a set of edge timeseriesthat is, a vector of how the edge changes over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The edge-edge DFC graph is constructed by treating these edge timeseries analogously to the node timeseries in the first step, and computing the relationship between every edge pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we focus on hyperedges, which are connected components of the absolute valued edge-edge DFC graph (described in more detail in Methods) [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To contextualize hypergraph analysis, we define the graph theoretic elements used to construct hypergraphs as follows:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Node: As in the FC literature, nodes denote brain regions, or groups of voxels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Edge: Also corresponding to the FC literature, edges denote correlations in activity between pairs of nodes over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A node-node graph G = {V, E} on N nodes will have  edges, because each pair is considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the majority of FC analyses, the edges are not thresholded for significance in the hypergraph analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Links: Links denote significant correlations in activity between pairs of edges over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An edge-edge graph G = {V, E} on  edges will have  possible links, but tends to be sparse in practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hyperedge: A hyperedge denotes a group of links connecting two or more edges with significantly correlated temporal profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyperedges are the simplest form of link community, since they are simply the connected components of the edge-edge graph G = {V, E}, where V is the set of edges and E is the set of links.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hypergraph: A hypergraph is a set of hyperedges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hypergraph analysis is a simple first step toward understanding the structure of functional dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyperedges are the connected components of the edge-edge graph, and so avoid the introduction of additional unconstrained parameters, unlike many common FC and DFC methods such as community detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The groups of brain regions that comprise hyperedges are not necessarily strongly active or strongly interconnected brain regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, correlations in the dynamic connectivity of these regions are the defining characteristics that determine hyperedge structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, hyperedge analysis is able to identify groups of dynamic connections that change from strong to weak (or vice versa) cohesively together over time, providing complementary information to other DFC methods that focus on only the strongest node-node correlations, such as dynamic community detection [26, 29, 30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that our choice of hyperedge metrics, as opposed to any other graph theoretic measure, is due to the simplicity of the hyperedge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is beyond the scope of the present investigation, other graph properties of the edge-edge graph are likely to provide insight into dynamic brain network structure along other relevant dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, hyperedges have some appealing intuitive validity in terms of the neural properties they might uncoverthat is, in defining collections of nodes (or more technically, edges) on the basis of their similar dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In previous work, we demonstrated that hyperedges discriminate between diverse task states in a group-level analysis of an fMRI data set spanning four tasks, which we refer to as the multi-task data set [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed notable variation in descriptive hypergraph measures across individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the level of abstraction involved in the construction of the hypergraph, an important first question is whether the method is able to capture well-known phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the variability in hypergraph cardinality and other individual difference measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We develop and employ hypergraph measures that capture individual differences in functional brain dynamics to determine correspondences between dynamics and specific demographic and behavioral measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the multi-task data set, we find that hypergraph cardinalitythe number of distinct hyperedges within a subjects hypergraphexhibits marked variation across individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, we find this measure is consistent within individuals, across overall hypergraphs and those associated with specific tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To elucidate the drivers of this striking variation in hypergraph metrics observed across subjects, we explore systematic relationships between hypergraph cardinality and individual difference measures spanning distinct domains such as demographics, cognitive strategy, and personality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the multi-task data set, we find a suggestive relationship between hypergraph cardinality and participant age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relationship is confirmed with an independent analysis of a data set with participants who range in age from 18 to 75, which we refer to as the age-memory data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report a strong positive relationship between age and hypergraph cardinality: older participants are significantly more likely to have a larger number of distinct hyperedges in their hypergraph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This agrees with the widely reported phenomenon of the loss of cohesion within intrinsic functional brain systems, because an increase in the number of distinct hyperedges linking various brain regions points to interconnections between functional groups evolving in time [13, 15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the hypergraph method agrees with previous descriptions of age-related brain changes, while capturing information about dynamics that adds a novel dimension to previous studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work further recommends the hypergraph as a useful tool in studying structure in dynamic functional connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Background_and_Multi-task_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Age-Memory_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The majority of the methods are identical to those discussed for the multi-task data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below, we point out aspects that differ between the two analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As mentioned above, the hyperedge method has been applied to the multi-task data set in a previous study [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we first recapitulate the key findings from that investigation and provide results of exploratory analyses that motivate the followup analyses on the age-memory data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then present results from the age-memory analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Summary_of_Prior_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A previous study of the multi-task data identified measures that capture significant differences in population-level hypergraph structure across tasks [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, extensive variation was observed in several hypergraph measures, including hypergraph cardinality, across individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results emphasize that hypergraph structure can be used to differentiate between task states and motivates our investigation of the correspondence between hypergraph structure and individual difference measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fig 3 depicts the empirical cumulative hyperedge size distributions for all hyperedges found across all subjects in the multi-task data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a null test, we shuffle the data over time and find no hyperedges of size greater than one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a rough power law for the smaller sizes (s less_than 100), followed by a gap in the distribution from about 100 to 1000 and a sharp drop at the system size ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shape of the distribution is due to the consistent hypergraph structure across individuals; the majority of subjects in this study have a hypergraph composed of one large hyperedge and many small hyperedges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this characteristic structure is common to most subjects in the study, the size of the largest hyperedge varies across individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This size is closely related to the hypergraph cardinality, defined as the number of hyperedges in a hypergraph, a measure which also exhibits large variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fig 3 also depicts task-dependent differences in the cumulative size distributions of task-specific hyperedges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Memory-specific hyperedges tend to be more numerous than those specific to the rest and attention tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the total number of task-specific hyperedges for any task is at least ten times fewer than the total number of hyperedges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our strict definition of task specificity includes only hyperedges specific to a single task and discards those associated with more than one task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is conservative, and likely leaves some meaningfully task-related hyperedges unclassified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it reduces the dimension of the task-specific results, and provides greater confidence that any hyperedges classified as task-specific are indeed providing truly task-driven information due to coherence within that task alone, rather than coherence due to an unrelated driver that is common to several tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are significant differences in the spatial organization of task-specific hyperedges over all individuals that are visualized in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plots depict task-specific hyperedge degree across the brain for each of the four tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the differences in magnitude between word memory and the other tasks, the locations of high hyperedge concentration vary with task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These significant differences in hypergraph structure between the tasks confirm that hypergraph structure varies between task states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, persistent variability in hypergraph measures across individuals indicates that the hypergraph method reflects innate differences beyond the current task state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work presented here follows this line of inquiry, beginning with an analysis of individual differences in the multi-task data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multi-task_Results__Individual_Differences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we illustrate and quantify the wide variation in hypergraph measures across individuals in the multi-task data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, we identify a particular measure, hypergraph cardinality, that demonstrates large variance across all individuals but is consistent within individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this, we investigate relationships between the variation in individual difference measures and the variation in hypergraph cardinality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results from this study are not statistically significant due to the limited variation in individual difference measures and strict corrections for multiple comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we report a marginally significant result relating demographics and word-memory hyperedge cardinality that motivates further analyses on the age-memory data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Age-Memory_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To supplement the findings from the multi-task data set, we perform a parallel set of analyses on the age-memory data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data set includes participants with ages ranging from 18 to 75, a range three times larger than the range of ages in the multi-task study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the age-memory study uses an almost identical task to the multi-task word-memory task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this section, we combine hypergraph results for all participants in the age-memory data set and obtain a distribution of hyperedge size over all participants with similar features to the hyperedge size distribution from the word-memory task of the multi-task data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then identify and test specific drivers of individual variation in hypergraph cardinality for the age-memory study participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find a strong correspondence between age and hypergraph cardinality that confirms the preliminary result from the multi-task study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Improving our understanding of the drivers of individual differences in functional brain imaging data can give insight into the dynamic mechanisms that lead to individual behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamic FC has been used over groups to explain changes in the brain attributed to individual differences in learning [30, 49, 63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypergraphs in particular have been used to analyze how long-term learning impacts the functional network structure [30] and how the brain switches between cognitive states [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous DFC study found task-dependent hypergraph properties at the level of the group, indicating that hypergraphs can be used to describe how functional dynamics differ between tasks [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we develop new hypergraph metrics to investigate individual differences in hypergraph structure and possible drivers of these variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our primary goal in the present investigation is to continue validating the hypergraph approach by demonstrating its ability to reproduce a well-known phenomenon in the FC literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hypergraphs are constructed from correlations between edges, providing a method of analysis complementary to static and dynamic graph theoretic methods including dynamic community detection and ALFF-FC [26, 27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this method, hyperedges are defined as connected components of the edge-edge graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A natural extension of the hyperedge formalism would be to perform edge-based community detection on the edge-edge adjacency matrix, which would further partition the connected components of the edge-edge graph [64, 65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, any graph theoretic measure that can be computed on the standard node-node graphclustering coefficient, assortativity, global efficiency, et ceteracan be computed with respect to the edge-edge graph, although the interpretation would of course be quite different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hypergraph method provides a rigourous graph theoretical formalism to study network dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout this study, we investigate hypergraph cardinality as a dependent variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, future investigations should be performed to determine whether hypergraph cardinality is a useful independent variable with predictive power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Disparate_Sources_of_Variability_in_Hypergraph_Structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As we showed in the Multi-Task Analysis, the hypergraph cardinality varies widely across individuals, but is consistent between task states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work on the multi-task data set found that the probability for hypergraphs to appear in a particular network configuration over individuals was significantly different depending on task state [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent spatial organization rules for each task existed at the level of the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were similarities in the spatial arrangement of hyperedges in the brain for differing tasks, but certain properties were found to vary significantly between tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain areas in the occipital lobe in particular were highly likely to participate in the hypergraph across individuals and across tasks, likely due to the visual nature of most of the cognitive tasks studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we study hypergraph cardinality, which displays high variability across individuals and consistency across tasks within individuals (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that hypergraph cardinality serves as an individual signature of a subjects brain dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similarities across subjects in the spatial distributions of hypergraphs described in [24] capture information orthogonal to the information summarized by hypergraph cardinality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, there are some individuals for whom the visual brain regions are linked by many hyperedges, and some for whom those same regions are linked by relatively few hyperedges, but these regions are more likely than others to be included in hypergraphs in the majority of subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that, for some subjects, brain regions tend to be more dynamically integrated in general, with co-varying functional relationships across many brain circuits; in other subjects, connectivity dynamics are more fragmented across the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high degree of variability in hypergraph cardinality across subjects and consistency within subjects, combined with the significant differences in spatial hyperedge arrangement across tasks, indicate that hypergraphs are a useful analysis tool for investigating both individual and task-based differences in brain function in a variety of settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, hypergraphs can provide a view of dynamic patterns that complements other commonly used DFC methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, many FC methods exclusively investigate the structure of strong correlations in functional data [29, 6668]; hypergraph analysis captures information about both strongly and weakly correlated dynamics and how sets of brain regions transition between them [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although they are highly informative, many of the hypergraph metrics we study here are representative measures that greatly reduce the dimension of the hypergraph and only reveal a small part of the information contained in its structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further development of methods to utilize more of the information that hypergraphs provide will allow characterization of the consistency of particular hyperedges and dynamic modes, an understanding of which are important for behavior, or influenced by demographics or disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work is also needed to further quantify the spatial differences in hypergraph arrangement across both individuals and tasks, to clarify the extent of overlap between the two types of information, and to determine whether the individual variability in cardinality can be mapped to individual spatial differences in hypergraph structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relationship_between_Age_and_Changes_in_DFC_Networks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FC studies have established clear trends associated with aging, including a decrease in connectivity within functional networks and an increase in connectivity across different functional networks in resting and task states [15, 6972].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these studies have considered resting-state FC, because the absence of task stimulus provides a simple and reliable setting for comparison between subjects [73], although recent studies have successfully used FC networks to study various cognitive proceses [74].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The default mode network (DMN) and similar resting-state analyses may miss functional changes evoked by task states; while the DMN FC decreases with age, task-related sensorimotor network FC has been shown to increase with age [12, 14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, FC in memory tasks shows increased segmentation with age [75].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extending these analyses to incorporate the dynamics of functional interactions is a necessary step towards quantifying individual changes in functional brain dynamics associated with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several efforts have been made to capture individual age-related differences with methods from dynamic FC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamic community structure and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation of FC were both found to be strongly correlated with age, illustrating that functional dynamics are closely linked with aging [26, 27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the dynamic community detection analysis, functional communities were found to be more fragmented with age, which agrees with the hypergraph cardinality result presented here [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A multi-scale community detection analysis uncovered similar fragmentation with age for small scales [76].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that hypergraph cardinality also increases with age aligns with this result and provides further information based upon its ability to capture higher-order dynamic patterns across larger ensembles of brain regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only do the functional similarities of communities of brain regions themselves become less distinct as humans age, but the temporal profiles of these functional similarities also become less integrated across brain regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement of this result with known age-related changes in FC [68, 13, 15] demonstrates the ability of hypergraph methods to capture and quantify major brain changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, since the hypergraph analysis is not limited to strong correlations, our analysis further suggests that age is related not only to the organization of functional activity in groups of brain regions with strongly coherent activity, but also to the coordination between groups of regions that transition from being strongly to weakly correlated over time (or vice versa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reported correspondence between age and hypergraph cardinality is significant in the age-memory data set, but our analysis did not include data that could verify this relationship for cognitive tasks other than the word memory task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although memory is a cognitive ability known to decline with age in many individuals, it is unlikely that the specific task studied in the age-memory data set drives this result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, the consistency of hypergraph cardinality across tasks seen in the multi-task data set in Fig 5(B) suggests that similar hypergraph cardinalities may be found during other tasks in data sets with higher age variability, and that the relationship between age and cardinality is unlikely to depend primarily on the behavioral task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further investigation is needed to determine whether individual differences in hyperedge structure have any significant relationship to behavioral or cognitive performance on any particular task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methodological_Considerations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we have shown that the considerable differences in functional connectivity dynamics across individuals are closely linked with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypergraph method is presented as an analysis tool that captures information about group-level similarities that differ between task states as well as individual differences that are consistent within individuals, across tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further investigation into a single hypergraph metric (hypergraph cardinality) that varies across individuals uncovers a significant relationship between hypergraph cardinality and age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, there are a greater number of hyperedges in older individuals hypergraphs, suggesting that there are more small groups of regions with cohesively evolving dynamics and indicating a loss of coherence across larger, spatially distributed intrinsic functional connectivity networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This complements widely reported relationships between FC and human aging by providing new insight into how FC activity and the co-evolution of FC activity are altered with increasing age, including the loss of large groups of co-evolving brain regions in older individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correspondence with and extension of classic FC results to new dynamic regimes, along with the unique capacity of hypergraphs to probe multiple dimensions of both strong and weak dynamic variability, show that hypergraph analysis is a valuable tool for understanding age-related changes and other individual differences in dynamic brain function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
