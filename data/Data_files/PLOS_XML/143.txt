Pigeons (Columba livia) as Trainable Observers of Pathology and Radiology Breast Cancer Images  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pathologists and radiologists spend years acquiring and refining their medically essential visual skills, so it is of considerable interest to understand how this process actually unfolds and what image features and properties are critical for accurate diagnostic performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Key insights into human behavioral tasks can often be obtained by using appropriate animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report here that pigeons (Columba livia)which share many visual system properties with humanscan serve as promising surrogate observers of medical images, a capability not previously documented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birds proved to have a remarkable ability to distinguish benign from malignant human breast histopathology after training with differential food reinforcement; even more importantly, the pigeons were able to generalize what they had learned when confronted with novel image sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birds histological accuracy, like that of humans, was modestly affected by the presence or absence of color as well as by degrees of image compression, but these impacts could be ameliorated with further training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turning to radiology, the birds proved to be similarly capable of detecting cancer-relevant microcalcifications on mammogram images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when given a different (and for humans quite difficult) tasknamely, classification of suspicious mammographic densities (masses)the pigeons proved to be capable only of image memorization and were unable to successfully generalize when shown novel examples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birds successes and difficulties suggest that pigeons are well-suited to help us better understand human medical image perception, and may also prove useful in performance assessment and development of medical imaging hardware, image processing, and image analysis tools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pathologists and radiologists are confronted daily with perceptual challenges in the medical imaging domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These individuals, even after years of education and training, may sometimes struggle to arrive at correct disease or risk classifications using the visual cues present on microscope slides or medical images (e.g., x-rays).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is considerable room for enhancing medical image perception and interpretation; this can occur not only via additional visual and verbal training [13], but also through ever-improving image acquisition technology, image processing and display.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such innovations in medical imaging must be validatedusing trained observersin order to monitor quality and reliability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process, while necessary, can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Automated computer-aided substitutes are available, but may fail to faithfully reflect human performance in many cases [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe here a potential alternative approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Research over the past 50 years has revealed that pigeons can be prodigious discriminators of complex visual stimuli, and are able to detect or discriminate: foreground from background [7]; misshapen pharmaceutical capsules [8]; letters of the alphabet [9]; basic object categories such as cats, flowers, cars, and chairs [10]; identities and emotional expressions of human faces [11]; and even paintings by Monet vs. Picasso [12], among many other impressive feats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pigeons visual memory is also outstanding, as they can recall more than 1,800 images [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, pigeons have demonstrated an ability to generalize their discrimination performance to novel objects or scenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are still a long way from knowing precisely how pigeons so successfully differentiate such complex and varied visual stimuli, but color, size, shape, texture, and configural cues all seem to participate [1416].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, however, the anatomical (neural) pathways that are involved, including basal ganglia and pallial-striatal (cortical-striatal in mammals) synapses, appear to be functionally equivalent to those in humans [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the well-documented visual skills of pigeons, it seemed to us possible that they might also be trained to accurately distinguish medical images of clinical significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected that, entirely without verbal instructions, operant conditioning procedures alone could prove sufficient for teaching the birds the intricate visual discrimination skills associated with diagnosing medically relevant images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basic similarities between vision-system properties of humans and pigeons also suggested that, if pigeons were confronted with pathology and radiology study sets of increasing difficulty, then their task accuracy would track that achievable by domain-expert human observers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In these initial studies, we sought answers to four questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, could discrimination between benign and malignant pathology and radiology images be taught to pigeonsentirely without the benefit of verbal instructions generally provided to human observers?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, could pigeons go beyond mere memorization and demonstrate generalization (i.e., perform accurately when confronted with related but novel stimuli)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, how would pigeons perform when given image discrimination tasks that are extremely difficult even for skilled human observers?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And fourth, if the birds were successful, then could such skills have any practical utility?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We provided food reinforcement to pigeon subjects, maintained just below their free-feeding weight, for correctly discriminatingvia two distinctively colored response buttonsimages of benign or malignant pathology specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial experiments focused on conventionally stained and digitally scanned breast pathology slides, starting with low (4×) and extending to medium (10×) and high (20×) levels of magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pigeons successful mastery of these tasks encouraged us to investigate their ability to detect diagnostically important microcalcifications in mammograms (a challenging, yet tractable task) [17], and also to attempt a much more difficult task, namely to classify benign and malignant breast masses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correctly identifying these challenging target masses is difficult even for trained radiologists [18]; and, in fact, it proved to lie at the limits of pigeons capabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although pigeons are unlikely to be called upon to offer clinical diagnostic support, it does seem quite possible that their discriminative abilities may be turned to a useful purpose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The need for image quality assessment is a practical one that arises in both pathology and radiology domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though pathologists still largely use optical microscopes for their clinical work, with the recent advent of digital pathology, diagnoses are increasingly being rendered directly from a computer screen rather than through a microscope [1921].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image acquisition and digital display technologiesand the accompanying softwareare continuously being updated; each technical iteration must be scrutinized to determine the merits and drawbacks of new vs. existing techniques [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such evaluations often require elaborate study designs and, crucially, the participation of one or more skilled observers [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, finding available and affordable clinicians can be difficult at best [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This process is similar to what is done in evaluating medical image quality with model or mathematical (so-called ideal) observers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purpose of these software-based tools is not to replicate human performance per se, but to help predict, for example, which manipulations of image quality (e.g., color fidelity or compression level) will impact human performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such mathematical models address only narrow sets of questions, are hard to adapt quickly to new problems, and require their own validation vis a vis human performance [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our research suggests that avian observers might be able to deliver relevant assessments of image diagnostic content and quality, as their performance is reproducible and can easily and quantitatively be tracked by modern conditioning techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

General_procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experiment_1_Breast_histopathology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experiment_2_Microcalcifications_in_mammograms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Switching from the domain of pathology to that of radiology, we explored pigeons visual capabilities with a pair of breast-cancer-relevant mammogram-based studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first series, using a similar training and testing regimen as described for the histopathology studies, a new cohort of birds was exposed to regions of mammograms devoid of or containing subtle microcalcifications (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These often-difficult-to-discern calcium deposits have considerable radiographic significance, as they can be reliably associated with the presence of cancer [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experiment_3_Mammogram_masses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second radiology study involved mammogram images containing (microcalcification-free) masses, with the image sets evenly split between benign or malignant as determined upon subsequent biopsy evaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experiment_1__Full-color_histopathology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remarkably, the pigeons rapidly learned to discriminate the appearance of benign from malignant breast tissue histology with high accuracy (Fig 6A), correct choice responses levels rising from 50% at the outset (i.e., at chance level) to 85% over 15 days of training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That rise was statistically significant, p = 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the succeeding 5 days, pigeons were trained with all rotations of the original image set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6B illustrates that, on Day 1 of rotation testing, accuracy to the original 0° slides averaged 86% correct, whereas accuracy to the five newly rotated slide views averaged 77% correct, a modest, but non-significant difference, p = 0.161; in each case, accuracy exceeded that expected by chance, one-tailed binomial tests, p less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the ensuing 4 days, accuracy to the 0° and rotated views converged, averaging 88% correct and 83% correct, respectively, on the fifth day of training (not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experiment_2__Mammograms_with_microcalcifications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Birds were able to learn to classify images with and without clusters of microcalcifications as adeptly as they had mastered the initial histopathology challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 11A shows that accuracy scores rose significantly from 50% to over 85% with 14 days of training, and the addition of rotation and image flipping only briefly and non-significantly affected accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With additional training, scores for the un-rotated and rotated views converged, averaging 86% and 82% correct, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over the next 5-day period, pigeons were given a small number of novel images with and without microcalcifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accuracy classifying the familiar images was greater than that for the novel images on the first day of testing, averaging 83% correct and 69% correct, respectively, but this difference was not statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern persisted over the next 4 days of testing, with accuracy averaging 84% correct and 72% correct, for familiar and novel images respectively, both significantly exceeding the level expected by chance (Fig 11B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a study of human radiologists and radiology residents given the same cases to review, accuracy averaged 97% for calc-(negative) images, but only 70% for calc-(positive) images; our birds performance did not reliably differ between the categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fairness, unlike the pigeons, the radiologists were not shown just small regions of interest, but whole images that had to be searched for abnormalities, a more challenging task [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experiment_3__Mammograms_with_masses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As can be appreciated by scrutinizing the representative images depicted in Fig 5, discriminating benign from malignant masses is very challenging indeed; the distinguishing features are extremely subtle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birds found this to be a much harder task than the others described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it took weeks rather than days for the birds to demonstrate successful learning of the training-set images, and, for the first time, there were notable disparities in the discrimination scores of the individual pigeons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 12A shows that the mean percentage of correct choice responses of two pairs of pigeons respectively rose to around 80% and 60% over 8 blocks of 10 days of training (almost 12 weeks), and one bird never managed to achieve statistically greater-than-chance performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strikingly, when the birds were subsequently tested with novel images, they utterly failed to exhibit significant generalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Day 1 performance (Fig 12B) during testing yielded average accuracy scores across all birds for familiar and novel images of 71% and 50% correct, respectively, with the scores averaging 74% and 44% respectively over the next 4 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the birds modest (albeit slowly achieved) performance during the training phase reflected successful image memorization, because despite exhibiting clear discrimination learning, even the two most accurate pigeons displayed no reliable generalization to the testing stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Histopathology__benign_vs_malignant_classification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found pigeons to be remarkably adept at several medical image classification tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They quickly learned to distinguish benign from malignant breast cancer histopathology (Fig 2) at all magnifications, a task that can perplex inexperienced human observers who typically require considerable training to attain mastery, although the examples shown are easily classified by a trained pathologist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting with the low-magnification (4×) examples, pigeons accuracy increased from 50% correct (i.e., chance) on Day 1 to near 85% by Days 1315 (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no notable difference in final accuracy levels on the 4×, 10×, and 20× images sets, indicating the birds could exploit image features at multiple spatial scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Being trained at one magnification primed the birds for above-chance performance at the next magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that the pigeons were not simply relying on rote memorization, performance was assessed on a testing set comprising new images presented to the birds without differential food reinforcement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remarkably, the pigeons were able to distinguish benign from malignant breast histopathology virtually as well on test image sets as they did on the training sets, at all magnifications Fig 7), indicating that they had somehow learned to detect critical discriminating features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pigeons proved to have an affinity for histopathology, as they achieved stable high performance as fast as or faster than with other visual discrimination problems studied in our Iowa laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, if instead of scoring per-bird performance, a flock-sourcing approach was taken, in which the birds in essence voted, then even higher levels of accuracy could be achieved: when a cohort of 4 birds was shown the full set of uncompressed images, the resulting group accuracy level reached an amazing 99%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Benign and malignant breast histopathology images can differ in terms of overall hue and brightness due to variations in cellular content and tinctorial properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that these relatively trivial (but systematically present) differences were not solely responsible for the birds classification accuracy, we removed color cues from the same training and testing sets used previously, and explored the effect on pigeons learning and transfer behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images were converted from full-color to monochrome, and then pseudo-colored with a single purplish hue that was the same as the average hue of the full-color scanned specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, because there was a trend for the cancer samples to be darker and to have higher contrast than their benign counterparts, we manually adjusted overall brightness and contrast levels to minimize differences between the benign and malignant image sets (Fig 3, top row).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two modifications were designed to emphasize the impact of variations in tissue morphology (or texture) on discrimination behavior, while minimizing the roles that color or staining intensities might play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a new cohort of pigeons was exposed to these monochrome, brightness-normalized images, they were still able to learn and generalize, indicating that morphology and/or texture differences alone were sufficient to sustain classification accuracy (but see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The birds did consistently misidentify a few images, and we wondered if there was a pattern to the errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because cancer cells arise from benign (probably stem-cell-like) precursors, the resulting growth patterns and cellular morphologies may deviate only minimally from those of corresponding normal tissues, as reflected in the term, well-differentiated carcinoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon review, it appeared that the troublesome images displayed similarities to some of the images in the alternate class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the benign image posing the greatest difficulty (Fig 13, upper left panel) contained breast lobular structures that were indeed benign, but nevertheless highly cellular and densely packed; consequently, at low magnification, they could resemble sheets of cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, one of the problematic malignant images (Fig 13, lower left panel) proved to be relatively hypocellular, with duct-like structures reminiscent of some of the benign exemplars (Fig 13, bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding to the potential for confusion, this malignant image also exhibited an abundance of dense eosinophilic (pink) stroma more typical of the normal examples in our training set and unlike most of the other cancer specimens shown to the birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the pigeons errors did not appear to be random; instead, the least-accurately classified images contained features that were relatively unrepresentative of the rest of the corresponding benign or malignant set, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that images used for training fairly represent the gamut likely to be encountered in future specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, of course, is true for pathology residents training as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effects_of_image_properties_on_learning_speed_and_accuracy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mammograms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We extended our exploration of pigeons medical-image-relevant capabilities by considering two problems in breast radiology: one, a microcalcification detection task; and the second, a mass discrimination task, both central to patient management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birds did well on the first challenge (Fig 11, but poorly on the second (Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensitivity to the presence of microcalcifications was learned and then applied to novel images with much the same success and trajectory as with the histopathology images, with the birds learning within a week, and generalizing reasonably well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The problem of finding little white specks in a complex background would seem to mirror the problem encountered in the pigeons native environment, of locating and ingesting seeds distributed in a visually cluttered environmentan obvious survival skill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, evaluating the malignant potential of detected breast masses (Fig 5) can be very challenging [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A panel of radiologists (tested by EAK) achieved an accuracy rate of about 80% when viewing images of the relatively subtle masses employed in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pigeons also found this task to be difficult, and in fact took many weeks to distinguish the training-set masses, rather than the days needed with the prior histopathology studies (Fig 12A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the histology and calcification tasks, in which all birds performed similarly, some birds proved to be more skilled during this phase; only two pigeons reached 80% correct classification, and the other two plateaued at 60%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, none of the birds performed well when they were shown novel testing stimuli, with even the high-performers during the training period doing no better than chance (Fig 12B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the birds memorized the masses in the training set, but never learned to key in on those features (for example, stellate margins) that can correlate with malignancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result reflects the difficulty of the task, with which even human experts struggle, and indicates that birds may be relatively faithful mimics of the strengths and weaknesses of human capabilities when viewing medical images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Human_and_avian_vision_systems__implications_for_potential_utility  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pigeons have low-level vision capabilities that generally parallel those of humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not surprising as the visual systems of all amniotes share major organizational properties [31, 32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific underlying mechanisms of visual learning appear to be similar between avians and primates, despite some 300 million years of evolutionary divergence and structural neuroanatomical disparities: feedforward and hierarchical processing seem to dominate [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some species-specific differences may also be significant: while pigeons can indeed distinguish human male from female faces, the primary features used appear to be largely texture-based [16]; by contrast, humans probably have additional recognition tools for faces (and emotions) that are not available to avian observers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, these higher-level differences are probably not relevant to the studies described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, on balance, it appears that pigeons visual discrimination abilities and underlying neural pathways are sufficiently similar to those of humans when challenged by medical image evaluation tasks as to have potential practical significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characteristics that are helpful in distinguishing benign from malignant histology, for example, may be apparent in overall tissue architecture variation as well as in differences in cell nuclear size, shape, or other features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathologists use such multi-scale features as they examine lesions at magnifications from 1× (sometimes by holding a glass slide against a white coat sleeve to assess blueness as an indicator of overall cellularity) to 40×, at which power nuclear chromatin distribution, for example, can be discerned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the pigeons were able to distinguish benign from malignant histologies at simulated magnifications from 4× to 20×, indicating that they were able to perform accurate classification across about a 20-fold resolution range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ability is consistent with their status as primarily vision-directed animals, and reflects their facility with locally weighted [33], texture-based discrimination tasks, at which they are at least as good as when they are confronted with object-, geometric-, or feature-based discrimination problems [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If pigeons were relying on textural clues, then this observation would parallel many current machine-learning approaches that depend on texture features to achieve strong and generalizable (medical) image segmentation performance [35, 36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies in which birds are exposed to images in which certain low-level pixel-based features are either emphasized or suppressed could help pinpoint which properties contribute most to detection or classification performance [16, 37, 38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such studies might also indicate how best to process and present medical images to human observers for maximal saliency, as well as motivate future machine-learning strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, our results suggest that pigeons can be used as suitable surrogates for human observers in certain medical image perception studies, thus avoiding the need to recruit, pay, and retain clinicians as subjects for relatively mundane tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond cost and convenience, there may be other advantages to using pigeons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the level of observer expertise for any given study can be set by design, from naïve to experta distribution that may hard to achieve with readily available human viewers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, pigeons can be used repeatedly in studies designed to explore a wide set of parameters [33] and more cases could be considered than human observers would ever tolerate, thereby yielding greater statistical power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pigeon-based experiments could also enable more rigorous analysis of the effects of lesion (target) prevalence on detection [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such studies involving adaptive interaction between observers and the observed are hard to replicate using only mathematical ideal observers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to content-based studies, it may also be helpful to use pigeons to explore the impact of technical aspects of color fidelity, display parameters (e.g., contrast, brightness, gamma), and image compression artifacts on observer performance, studies that can present logistical challenges that are associated with assembling appropriate and affordable expert human panels [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, color fidelity in digital pathology is a major issue for image capture and presentation [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example of how pigeons could be used in this context, we found that complete removal of color information had measurable effects on pigeon classification accuracy and learning trajectory, but the birds were nevertheless able to overcome these performance deficits with increased exposure to the monochrome images, aspects of discriminative performance that may faithfully reflect human behavior as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of course, pigeons are not the only animals to have shown abilities relevant to medical diagnoses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other animals with special perceptual skills have been proposed as front-line diagnosticians, for example, dogs sniffing out prostate or ovarian cancer [42, 43] or giant African pouched rats detecting tuberculosis [44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are not (yet) proposing such a role for pigeons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we have shown that pigeons can be effective, tractable, relevant, informative, statistically interpretable, and cost-effective medical image observers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their performance on visual discrimination tasks might prove useful in guiding basic vision research into feature saliency and could play a key role in the development of computer-assisted medical image recognition tools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
