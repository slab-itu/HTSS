The varieties of contemplative experience: A mixed-methods study of meditation-related challenges in Western Buddhists  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Buddhist-derived meditation practices are currently being employed as a popular form of health promotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While meditation programs draw inspiration from Buddhist textual sources for the benefits of meditation, these sources also acknowledge a wide range of other effects beyond health-related outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Varieties of Contemplative Experience study investigates meditation-related experiences that are typically underreported, particularly experiences that are described as challenging, difficult, distressing, functionally impairing, and/or requiring additional support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mixed-methods approach featured qualitative interviews with Western Buddhist meditation practitioners and experts in Theravda, Zen, and Tibetan traditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interview questions probed meditation experiences and influencing factors, including interpretations and management strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A follow-up survey provided quantitative assessments of causality, impairment and other demographic and practice-related variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The content-driven thematic analysis of interviews yielded a taxonomy of 59 meditation-related experiences across 7 domains: cognitive, perceptual, affective, somatic, conative, sense of self, and social.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in cases where the phenomenology was similar across participants, interpretations of and responses to the experiences differed considerably.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The associated valence ranged from very positive to very negative, and the associated level of distress and functional impairment ranged from minimal and transient to severe and enduring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to determine what factors may influence the valence, impact, and response to any given experience, the study also identified 26 categories of influencing factors across 4 domains: practitioner-level factors, practice-level factors, relationships, and health behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By identifying a broader range of experiences associated with meditation, along with the factors that contribute to the presence and management of experiences reported as challenging, difficult, distressing or functionally impairing, this study aims to increase our understanding of the effects of contemplative practices and to provide resources for mediators, clinicians, meditation researchers, and meditation teachers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Buddhist meditation practices, which traditionally have been part of an extensive religious path to awakening (bodhi), are now in the modern Western context also a popular form of general health promotion that is simultaneously bound to and divorced from its religious roots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by Buddhist claims for the possibility of freedom from suffering (dukkha), key Buddhist doctrines and practices have been re-presented within and adapted to psychological and biomedical frameworks [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this new context, Buddhist-derived meditation practices inform treatment programs such as mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), which are being applied towards the alleviation of a wide range of ailments, including stress [2], addiction [3], chronic pain [4], mood disorders [5], psychiatric disorders [6], and medical conditions [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such programs have also been used to improve cognitive abilities [8] and emotion regulation [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MBIs are being employed at institutional levels, including prisons [10, 11], the military [1214], and in both K-12 [1518] and higher education [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With more than 20 mindfulness phone apps [20], mindfulness is major contributor to the billion-dollar meditation industry [21] that serves more than 18 million meditators [22], with 1 million new meditators each year in the United States alone [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For its theory and practices, as well as for its legitimacy and authenticity, the mindfulness movement draws heavily from Buddhist texts and teachings [24, 25]; it also looks to studies of long-term Buddhist meditators as evidence of meditations potential benefits [2629].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these sources are often assumed to be indicative of the effects of meditation, the focus on positive health-related benefits represents only a narrow selection of possible effects that have been acknowledged within Buddhist traditions both past and present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Scholars of Buddhist Studies have documented the historical processes responsible for the current alliance between Buddhism and science [3032].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent scholarship has also addressed how the modern representation of Buddhism as secular, empirical, and scientific (or a least compatible with these modern Western values) has led to the success of the mindfulness movement within biomedical health science and the broader spiritual marketplace, which has branded mindfulness as relevant and efficacious not for the attainment of religious goals, but for a project of health, happiness, and well-being believed to have a broader, if not universal, appeal [3336].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the limited focus on the benefits of meditation for physical and psychological health and well-being is a modern and largely Western creation that neither represents the diversity of meditation practices nor the range of possible or even likely effects of those practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many Buddhist literary sources describe how meditation practices are expected to lead to perceptual, affective, epistemic, and behavioral shifts that lie beyond the scope of the health-related outcomes that are the concern of MBIs and associated scientific research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biographical narratives and stages-of-the-path literature across Buddhist traditions also acknowledge periods of challenge or difficulty associated with the practice of meditation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Tibetan Buddhist traditions, the term nyams refers to a wide range of meditation experiencesfrom bliss and visions to intense body pain, physiological disorders, paranoia, sadness, anger and fearwhich can be a source of challenge or difficulty for the meditation practitioner [37, 38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain nyamsin particular the triad of bliss (bde ba), clarity or luminosity (gsal ba), and non-conceptuality (mi rtog pa)are multivalent in that in some lineages of Tibetan Buddhism they are deliberately cultivated and framed as signs of progress, and yet in other contexts can be dismissed as untrustworthy hindrances to genuine insight [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Zen Buddhist traditions, the term maky refers to a class of largely perceptual side-effects or disturbing conditions that arise during the course of practice and which are also sometimes interpreted as signs of progress [40, 41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zen traditions have also long acknowledged the possibility for certain practice approaches to lead to a prolonged illness-like condition known as Zen sickness [42] or meditation sickness [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ragama Straa classic text of Mahyna Buddhismenumerates fifty deceptive or illusory experiences that are associated primarily, though not exclusively, with the practice of concentration (samdhi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Stra particularly warns about pleasant experiences that lead the meditator into a false sense of spiritual progress, which results in misguided thinking and conduct [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in Theravda Buddhist traditions, progress in the practice of meditation is expected to lead to transient experiences called corruptions of insight (vipassan-upakkiles) on account of meditators tendency to confuse these blissful and euphoric states for genuine insight [44, 45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some modern accounts also include reports of monks becoming mentally unstable in the wake of such states [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other stages of practice, in particular some of the insight knowledges (vipassan-Ã±a), are presented as being particularly challenging, especially in modern Asian sources [47, 48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biographical narratives and stages-of-the-path textual sources cannot necessarily be taken as straightforward descriptions of the experiences of past Buddhists, as such texts often also have prescriptive or polemical inclinations [49, 50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the privileging of experiences as central to meditation may in some cases reflect modern sensibilities rather than Buddhist concerns throughout the ages [51].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, Buddhist-derived meditation practices are often presented in the West in terms of their non-religious health-related outcomes with little to no attention given to the possibility of the broader range of effects suggested by both traditional Buddhist sources as well as modern American Buddhist authors [52, 53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that some of these effects might even run counter to the dominant paradigm of health and well-being, it is critical that the range of effects associated with Buddhist meditation be investigated in the modern Western context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we need to know: What is the range of effects associated with the practice of meditation in this context?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And what effects do people report as unexpected, challenging, difficult, or distressing?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Answering these questions will increase our knowledge of how Buddhist meditation is understood and practiced in the West, the type of support structures that are needed for meditation-related challenges, and the potential boundary conditions of applications of meditation for health and well-being.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous_research_on_the_range_of_effects_from_meditation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beyond the extensive literature on the positive effects of meditation for physical, emotional, and mental health and well-being, studies of other meditation effects fall into two broad categories: 1) studies of side effects or adverse effects, and 2) research on anomalous, spiritual, mystical, or religious experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenomena covered in these two literatures are not necessarily distinct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, the difference in appraisal often reflects the disciplinary perspective and methodological approach of the researchers involved, as well as the social contexts of the populations being studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Providing a comprehensive review of studies on the range of phenomena associated with anomalous, spiritual, mystical, or religious experiences is beyond the scope of this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, this section focuses specifically on recent clinical, experimental, and qualitative research on the effects of Buddhist or Buddhist-based meditation practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Meditation-related effects that are not health-related benefits or that are reported as distressing have been classified as side effects or adverse effects (AEs), especially in clinical psychology research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While randomized clinical trials are the most reliable source for acquiring accurate information about positive effects, information about adverse effects has not been readily available for several reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the vast majority ( greater than 75%) of meditation studies do not actively assess adverse effects [2, 54]; instead, they rely solely on patients to spontaneously report any difficulties to the researchers or teachers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, patients are unlikely to volunteer information about negative reactions to treatment without being directly asked due to the influence of authority structures and demand characteristics [5557].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, passive monitoring is thought to underestimate AE prevalence by more than 20-fold [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few MBI researchers have started to actively monitor AEs either through questionnaires or through clinician interviews [5961].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these are typically limited to serious AEs (life-threatening or fatal events) or deterioration on pre-existing clinical outcomes that require clinical attention, such as increased depression or suicidality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These AEs, as well as traumatic flashbacks, are now listed in the MBI guidelines under risks to participants [62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Meditation-related adverse effects that were serious or distressing enough to warrant additional treatment have been reported in clinical and medical literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include reports of meditation-induced psychosis, seizures, depersonalization, mania and other forms of clinical deterioration [6373].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Descriptions of meditation-induced depersonalization and other clinically relevant problems also appear in the APAs Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [7476].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While meditation-related difficulties that are serious enough to warrant treatment are acknowledged in the clinical literature, there continues to be a lack of systematic investigation into challenging meditation experiences, what causes them, and how to prevent or manage them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reports from meditation practitioners have also been researched within the framework of anomalous experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such studies are often lab-based experiments that use inductions to create state-based changes in one or more meditators in order to explore neural correlates [7779].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This category includes studies on changes in sense of self [7881], changes in sense of time and space [77, 80, 82], and changes in perception [83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other research has investigated trait-based changes in perception following an extended period of meditation practice [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to these experimental studies, some qualitative studies have used theory-driven approaches to anomalous experiences that aim to test a specific hypothesis rather than conduct an open-ended exploration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Chen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2011) [80] asked Chinese Chan and Pure Land Buddhist meditators questions based on Hoods Mysticism Scale in order to investigate whether their experiences provided evidence for a common core of mystical experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through a semi-structured interview, Full et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2013) [83] investigated changes in perception in thirteen advanced Burmese meditation practitioners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the interview specifically probed changes in perception and associated benefits of meditation, it lacked a complementary probe for possible negative effects or an open-ended question to report other types of experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the sample was mostly male, Burmese-authorized lineage holders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While valuable, these two qualitative studies of meditative experiences are limited in that they were exclusively of Asian participants, did not ask open-ended questions that allow for a broader range of experiences associated with meditation to be reported, and did not explicitly assess the role of the practitioners interpretative framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For phenomena about which little is known, qualitative studies that ask open-ended questions are the most informative and produce the richest phenomenological data about meditation-related experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a pioneering project, Kornfield (1979) [84] conducted a mixed-methods study of American Buddhist meditators during a 3-month Vipassana retreat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this study did not specifically probe challenging or difficult experiences, the open-ended query about unusual experiences yielded reports uncommon in the research literature, including strong negative emotions, involuntary movements, anomalous somatic sensations, and out-of-body experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, Lomas et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2014) [85] asked active meditators to recount their involvement with meditation, and received both positive and negative reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meditators reported exacerbation of psychological problems, including anxiety and depression, troubling experiences of self, and reality being challenged, which included out-of-body experiences and in one case resulted in patient hospitalization for psychosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the study was also of an all-male sample almost entirely from one community; in addition, the authors acknowledge that their sample arguably excludes people whose experiences of meditation were so troubling as to cause them to cease practicing (since only currently active meditators were recruited).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In one of the only prospective studies to use qualitative methods to deliberately ask about adverse effects, Shapiro (1992) [67] found that 63% of meditators on an intensive Vipassana retreat reported at least one adverse effect, with 7.4% reporting effects negative enough to stop meditating, and one individual hospitalized for psychosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VanderKooi (1997) [86] also specifically queried difficulties or extreme states with both meditators and the teachers who helped them navigate their experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a series of case vignettes, the report emphasizes the challenges of integrating conflicting interpretive frameworks from Buddhism and psychiatry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study also illustrates how teachers can be a rich and often under-utilized source of information about meditation-related difficulties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While these studies make important contributions towards an interdisciplinary conversation about the range of experiences associated with meditation practices in general and Buddhist meditation practices in particular, each methodological approach is associated with its own set of limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-person case studies provide some insight into unexpected symptoms associated with meditation, but do not get at the broader range of phenomena, nor can they identify patterns that would help researchers, clinicians, and teachers to investigate what types of experiences might be expected to arise when certain causal factors are present or absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even larger-scale studies on groups of meditators have indicated that assessing sensitive, socially undesirable experiences such as adverse reactions to meditation requires specific probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In clinical, experimental, and qualitative research on meditation alike, the extent to which adverse meditation experiences are reported is proportional to how specifically they are queried.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, the interpretative frameworks and appraisal processes of researchers and subjects alike also frame and impact the results and require special consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is difficult to discern to what extent the classification of an experience as an adverse effect, a religious experience, or any other designation reflects a real difference in phenomenology or is a consequence of an appraisal made either by a meditator, a researcher, or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar challenges affect research that attempts to compare and differentiate mystical or religious experiences from psychopathology [8790] (see Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of attempting to impose an interpretative framework by classifying certain meditation-related experiences as religious experiences or alternately as forms of psychopathology, a better approach is to identify the interpretative frameworks held by meditation practitioners or offered by meditation experts and their impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_varieties_of_contemplative_experience_research_study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The purpose of the current study is to build upon the research summarized above by specifically addressing the following questions: What is the range of meditation-related effects described by Buddhist practitioners in the West?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What types of experiences do they report as unexpected, challenging, difficult, distressing, or functionally impairing?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What are the hypothesized causes of those experiences?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What interpretations are they given by others?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What impact do these experiences have on the lives of meditation practitioners?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How do practitioners prevent, manage, navigate, or integrate such experiences?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How do teachers guide their students through such experiences?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Through qualitative interviews with Western Buddhist meditation practitioners and meditation experts (teachers and clinicians), the Varieties of Contemplative Experience (VCE) research study attempts to investigate the broader range of experiences associated with meditation practices in the West.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to better understand the types of experiences that tend to be under-reported in scientific research, scholarship, and the media, the VCE study intentionally queried experiences that practitioners found unexpected, difficult, distressing, or functionally impairing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interviews also asked about the range of interpretations given to experiences, as well as the putative causes of and remedies for difficult experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meditation experts were also queried for how they interpret and manage challenging experiences that are reported by their students or patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to providing descriptions of experiences and identifying potential influencing factors, the VCE study ultimately aims to provide meditators, teachers and clinicians with practical management strategies for challenging meditation-related experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Qualitative_approach_and_research_paradigm  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While quantitative methods are appropriate for "known" or well-characterized phenomena, qualitative methods are particularly appropriate when little is known because they allow for identification of previously unknown processes, explanations of why and how phenomena occur, and the range of their effects [91].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitative methods are used when the goals are developing a hypothesis or theory in the early stages of an inquiry, understanding particular cases in depth and detail, getting at meanings in context, and capturing changes in a dynamic environment [92].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the VCE study aims to investigate a wide range of meditation-related experiences as well as to understand how they are integrated into practitioners lives, qualitative methodology was the most appropriate approach for undertaking this project because it allowed participants to describe their experiences in their own words and to offer their own explanations for them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attention to these experiences, and the language used to describe them, is an essential formative step towards building a research strategy for further understanding them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the fundamental principles of qualitative research, our methods are also informed by other theories and approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study design and approaches to data analysis are shaped in part by the attribution theory approach to the study of experiences deemed religious developed by Taves (2008 and 2009) [93, 94] to advance the cognitive science of religion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By meditation-related experiences we are referring to a range of effects across different domains of human experience that meditation practitioners in our study attributed to one or more types of meditation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to causal attributions, practitioners and experts alike are also agents in ascribing significance, meaning, and value to meditation-related experiences, sometimes in incompatible ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our methods are further informed by the cultural psychiatry approach, which investigates the ways in which psychopathology and healing are shaped by cultural knowledge and practices, and which allows for local nosologies and emic categories of experience to inform the analysis [95].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Context  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the widespread practice of Buddhist meditation in the West is a relatively recent phenomenon, and because Buddhist-derived meditation practices such as mindfulness are increasingly being deployed in various novel settings such as schools, clinics, and hospitals, more information is needed on the range of experiences associated with the practice of Buddhist meditation in the West.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To capture ecologically valid or real world scenarios, the VCE study includes practitioners from multiple traditions who engaged in various meditation practices in the context of either daily practice or intensive retreat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationship between traditional forms of meditation and their therapeutic applications is still being negotiated, with many advocates for a deeper relationship between interventions and traditional Buddhist theory and practice [96, 97].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, assessing the range of experiences reported by practitioners in a variety of Buddhist traditions not only provides valuable information about Buddhism as it is practiced and experienced in the West, it also has the potential to inform MBIs and other novel interventions derived from Buddhist practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Researcher_characteristics_and_reflexivity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Varieties of Contemplative Experience study was executed by an interdisciplinary research team comprised of a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist (WB), three religious studies scholars (JL, DC, NF), and a qualitative methodologist trained in both medical anthropology and behavioral medicine (RR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interviewers had practical expertise and/or academic expertise with one or more of the three main Buddhist meditation traditions being researched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to establish rapport with interview subjects and to be able to engage with tradition-specific practices or terminology, interviewers were regularly matched with interview subjects practicing in the traditions in which they had one or more forms of expertise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interviewers received training in qualitative methods and interviewing procedures, including sitting in on interviews and reviewing transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interdisciplinary nature of our team required that interpretive and disciplinary perspectives be made explicit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any theory-driven approaches to qualitative analysis aimed to be representative of multiple interpretive and disciplinary perspectives, as well as faithful to the reports from the practitioners themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ethical_issues_pertaining_to_human_subjects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study protocol and consent procedure was approved by the Brown University Institutional Review Board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants reviewed a consent form and provided informed consent before participating in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Documentation of written consent was waived for this study because most interviews took place remotely via telephone or video conferencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, participants provided verbal consent, which was recorded in a password-protected database on a secure server.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All practitioners were de-identified, and their names were replaced with a subject ID number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potentially identifying information, such as names of centers, spouses and geographical locations, was omitted from transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_collection_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interviews were conducted between December 2010 and March 2016 via telephone, video conferencing, or in person either by the PIs (WB, JL) or by other study personnel (NF, DC, and others).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interview duration was typically between 45 and 120 minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data collection instruments were adapted iteratively to optimally balance structured and unstructured components of the interview, with the dual aim of facilitating exploration of the topic and the ability to compare data across practitioners [101].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the exploratory, content-driven nature of the study, both practitioner and expert interviews were semi-structured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While demographic information was often reported during the course of the interview, the importance of specific factors such as early life relationships, psychiatric history, and trauma history emerged during the course of the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to ensure consistent and comparable information for all practitioners, a follow-up questionnaire was employed to gather comprehensive demographic information and detailed assessments of causality and impairment (see Additional instruments and quantitative measures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Data_processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interviews were digitally recorded, and audio files were transcribed by study personnel in the Clinical and Affective Neuroscience Lab at Brown University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Practitioner interviews were rendered verbatim, but vocalizations such as um, like, kind of, and you know as well as identifying information were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Names of teachers and Buddhist centers of study and practice were removed when this information could be used to identify the practitionerfor instance, if they were lineage holders in a tradition where the teacher had only a few direct disciples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Names of friends and family members, universities attended, and states of residence were also removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcripts were then verified by a separate research assistant or study personnel to ensure accurate rendering of content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When necessary, religious studies scholars (JL, DC) were consulted to ensure accurate rendering of names of teachers, institutions, and places as well as tradition-specific foreign language terminology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Qualitative data analysis is a systematic means of organizing and then describing interview data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used an exploratory, content-driven thematic analysiswhere the analytical categories that are used to establish comparisons across reports derive primarily from the reports themselvesbecause this is the method that is recommended when there is little former knowledge about a phenomenon [101, 120].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through this approach, we were able to establish systematic descriptions of reports of specific aspects of meditation experiences (phenomenology) as well as of specific interpretations, causal attributions, and remedies (influencing factors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The qualitative data analysis used open coding techniques [121], which are intended to open up the text in order to uncover its content and meaning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following DeCuir-Gunby et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2011) [122], a data-driven approach was augmented by the incorporation of some theory-driven categories already existent in the literature on meditation, psychology, or phenomenology (e.g., [84, 123]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coding structure was revised iteratively until saturation was reachedi.e., when new interviews produced little or no new data and no changes to the existing coding structure [101].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participant_flow  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A total of 73 meditation practitioners completed interviews.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirteen practitioner interviews were excluded from the current analysis for failure to meet inclusion criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, interviews with five practitioners revealed a mixed practice history that precluded clear classification as Theravda, Zen, or Tibetan and/or included a significant influence from non-Buddhist meditation practices such as Hindu traditions or the use of technology-based meditation apps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four practitioners were excluded from the current analysis for failing to report any challenging experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four practitioners were excluded because their phenomenology could be accounted for by alternative causes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 60 practitioners were given the demographic and attributes form after all interviews were completed; 100% of respondents met causality assessment criteria (score greater than 2, mean 4.2 Â±1.1) and were included in the present analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fifty-three practitioners (88%) completed the follow-up questionnaire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 7 (12%) non-completers, information was extracted by researchers based upon the content of their interview transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are based on a sample size of 60 practitioners unless otherwise indicated (i.e., in the case that one or more participants declined to answer a survey item and/or did not volunteer the information during the interview).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sample_characteristics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Context_and_practice_at_the_onset_of_meditation-related_challenges  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The amount of meditation practice prior to the onset of challenging or difficult experiences ranged from 1 day to more than 25 years (mean = 7.1 years; SD = 8.0 years).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than a quarter (29%) of practitioners first encountered challenges within their first year of practice, almost one half (45%) between 110 years of practice, and one quarter (25%) after more than 10 years of practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven participants (12%) reported challenges during the first 10 days of their practice, and 11 participants (18%) reported challenges during the first 50 hours of practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Challenges occurred during or immediately following a retreat for 43 practitioners (72%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other 17 practitioners (28%) reported challenging experiences in the context of daily practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About three-quarters (72%) of participants were regularly practicing within a meditation community or were working with a teacher (75%) when challenging experiences arose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of meditation-related challenges, 14 practitioners (25%) were practicing meditation for 3060 minutes per day, 19 (34%) were practicing for 19 hours per day, and 23 (41%) were practicing for 10 or more hours per day (see Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phenomenology__Domains_and_categories  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thematic content analysis of practitioner interviews for phenomenology captured the various types of experiences that practitioners associated with meditation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifty-nine categories of meditation-related effects were clustered into 7 higher-order domains (see Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All practitioners reported meditation-related changes across multiple domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average number of domains reported per practitioner was 6.1 (SD = 1.00), with a range from 37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly three-quarters (73%) of practitioners reported 6 or more domains, with coverage of all 7 domains as the most common pattern (43%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each domain was reported by at least three-quarters of the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The number of categories in each domain varied, ranging from 315.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average number of total categories reported per practitioner was 19.6 (SD = 7.2), with a range from 740.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half of the sample (50%) reported more than 20 categories, with 10% reporting more than 30, and 5% reporting less than 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each category was reported by an average of 20 different participants (SD = 10.2), with a range from 2 (for scrupulosity) to 49 (for fear), indicating both maximal consistency and range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 4 displays the seven domains horizontally from left to right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The categories of each domain are listed vertically in descending order of frequency (percent of practitioners reporting).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a group, the 32 experts reported 56 out of 59 (95%) phenomenology categories, with an average of 8.5 categories (SD = 5.6) per expert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three categories that were reported by practitioners but not experts were: Crying, laughing; Distortions in time or space; and Fatigue, weakness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a detailed comparison between meditators' and experts' reports of meditation-related experiences is beyond the scope of this paper, it is worth noting that three of the categories most frequently reported by practitionersFear, anxiety, panic, or paranoia (82%), Positive affect (75%), and Somatic energy (63%) were also among the most commonly reported by experts (72%, 50%, and 41% respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Re-experiencing of traumatic memories also had similar frequencies for experts (47%) and practitioners (43%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These similarities between practitioner and experts reports were not impacted by the 11 participants who provided both practitioner and expert interviews.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experts data remained unchanged regardless of whether those 11 individuals were included or excluded from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as explained above, because expert interviews provided second-person reports about their students, their accounts were less informative for phenomenology coding than practitioner interviews.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They provided fewer reports and those reports were characterized by less precise descriptions such as emotional problems or mental instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Description_of_phenomenology_domains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following summary is intended to provide some basic descriptions of categories beyond the category titles in Table 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described above, phenomenology categories were largely data-driventhat is, based upon the language and concepts used by practitioners in reporting their experiences during the interview.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in later iterations of the codebook, it was important to refine category descriptions and distinctions in order to ensure that categories could encompass reports from multiple individuals as well as the language and perspectives from appraisals both within and beyond Buddhist traditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further refine distinctions, for some categories this data-driven approach was augmented by a theory-driven approach by drawing upon etic concepts from psychology, neuroscience, phenomenology, and religious studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the number of categories, the number of references for each category, and the complex relationship among categories, a complete and detailed exploration of each category is beyond the scope of this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The summaries of each domain provided below will be unpacked in much greater depth in subsequent publications and should therefore be regarded as preliminary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a comprehensive description of each category, including brief descriptions, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria, see S4 File.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Causality_criteria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Causal attribution to meditation was assessed with 11 criteria (see above Additional instruments and quantitative measures: Causality assessment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior published reports included more than 40 published reports, including case reports or studies [64, 65, 6773, 7779, 82, 8486, 133146], reviews of meditation-related risks, adverse effects or contraindications, [63, 147154], medical textbooks [7476, 155] and MBI implementation guidelines [62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expert judgment was derived from interviews with 32 meditation teachers and clinicians who reported 56 categories of meditation-related experiences that they had observed in their students.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Through the causality assessment section of the demographic and attributes follow-up questionnaire, practitioners reported on six causality criteria: subjective attribution, temporal proximity (challenge), exacerbation, consistency, de-challenge, and re-challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meditation practitioners met an average of four causality criteria (mean = 4.2 Â±1.1 range = 26;), with more than half (60%) meeting four, five, or all six criteria, well-exceeding the minimum cutoff of two that standard guidelines use to warrant further investigation [118].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 5 shows the percent of the sample meeting each individual criterion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The consistency criterion was assessed on three levels: In the current study, 88% of the practitioner sample met the intra-subjective consistency criterion, indicating that they reported having the same or a similar experience during or following meditation on multiple occasions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inter-subjective consistency was assessed through evaluating how many practitioners reported each category (see Table 4 above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each category of experience was reported by an average of 20 practitioners, indicating that the same or a similar experience occurring in temporal proximity to meditation was reported by multiple individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross-modal consistency was assessed by comparing the phenomenology reported in practitioner interviews to the phenomenology reported in expert interviews.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifty-six of 59 (95%) categories of experience were reported by both practitioners and experts, with an average of 20 (SD = 10.2) practitioners and 4.6 (SD = 4.3) experts reporting each category.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported above, similarities between practitioner and expert reports were not impacted by the 11 participants who provided both practitioner and expert interviews.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Duration__severity_and_associated_impairment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The vast majority (88%) of participants reported that challenging or difficult meditation experiences bled over into daily life or had an impact on their life beyond a meditation retreat or beyond a formal practice session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The term symptoms is used here to denote the subset of experiences that were experienced as challenging, difficult or functionally impairing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 shows the duration of symptoms and their associated impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median duration of symptoms was 13 years, ranging from a few days to more than 10 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While 10% reported minimal impairment, impairment tended to mirror symptom duration, lasting from days to more than a decade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the sample (73%) indicated moderate to severe impairment in at least one domain, with 17% reporting suicidality, and 17% requiring inpatient hospitalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Influencing_factors__Domains_and_categories  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thematic content analysis of both practitioner and expert interviews for influencing factors (IF) captured the contextual factors that practitioners or experts associated with the onset of meditation-related experiences and the way those experiences changed over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-six categories of influencing factors were clustered into 4 higher-order domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The average number of influencing factors reported per person was 15.1 (SD = 3.5, range 923) for practitioners, and 14.7 (SD = 3.3, range 821) for experts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each category was reported by an average of 35 different practitioners and 19 different experts, indicating high consistency across both practitioners and experts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 6 displays the 4 domains of IFs horizontally from left to right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The categories of each IF domain are listed vertically in descending order of frequency (percent of practitioners reporting) [percent of experts reporting].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Description_of_influencing_factor_domains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following summary aims to clarify how influencing factors were defined and operationalized, which was primarily data-driven from practitioner and expert interviews.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enumeration of influencing factors should not be taken as a theory or hypothesis about risk factors and remedies for meditation-related difficulties put forth by the authors; rather, it reflects the views and experiences of the practitioners and experts who were subjects in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis, as well as research in controlled conditions, is necessary in order to evaluate whether these influencing factors are in fact correlated with a category of experience, the duration of challenging or difficult experiences, or the associated degree of distress or impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a comprehensive description of each category, including descriptions, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria, see S5 File.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based upon qualitative interviews of Western Buddhist practitioners and experts, the Varieties of Contemplative Experience study developed a taxonomy of meditation-related experiences, with a special effort to capture under-reported experiences characterized as challenging, difficult, distressing, or impairing, and which may need specific kinds of support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thematic content analysis yielded 59 categories of experiences across 7 domains, including cognitive, perceptual, affective, somatic, conative, sense of self, and social.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each category was reported by an average of 20 practitioners and 5 experts, indicating high consistency across participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The valence and level of impact ranged from very positive to very negative, with the associated level of distress and functional impairment ranging from minimal and transient to severe and lasting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This range of experiences and impacts suggests that very few of the experiences were universally appraised as adverse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the valence and impact of any category of experience was dependent on a complex interaction with other influencing factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in order to determine what variables affect the valence and impact of a given experience, the study also identified 26 categories of influencing factors across 4 domains, including factors related to the practitioner, the practice, relationships, and health behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Appraisal_processes_and_differential_diagnosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While one of the central aims of the VCE study is to understand the influence of meditation techniques on resultant experience, querying phenomenology within the broader context of influencing factorssome of which are sociocultural in natureenhances our understanding of the impact of cultural contexts and conceptual frameworks on meditation experiences, as well as on how such experiences are appraised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assessing the role of appraisal was built directly into the VCE study interview protocol by asking practitioners and experts to differentiate experiences associated with meditation from how they are interpreted, how they are believed to be caused, and how they are to be addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While querying descriptive reports of experience independently from interpretations and causal attributions is not intended to separate an unmediated experience from a culturally determined description[50], this approach nevertheless facilitates a better understanding of how causal attributions and ascriptions of significance, meaning, and value are applied to experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also identifies the influence that social agents have on the appraisal of meditation-related experiences, ranging from meditation community members and especially meditation teachers to agents beyond meditation communities such as doctors and psychotherapists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current study not only highlights the central role of appraisal in interpreting meditation experiences, but also that there are multiple, and sometimes conflicting, interpretative frameworks at play for Western Buddhist meditators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values held by meditation practitioners are often heavily influenced by how the authorities of a Buddhist traditionwhether canonical texts, teachers, or members of a practice communityappraise a given meditation practice or experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior conceptual frameworks acquired through philosophical or theoretical study, communities, families, as well as the media, likely influence how those who encounter meditation-related difficulties appraise such experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While explanatory frameworks for meditation-related experiences exist within Buddhism, what is categorized as progress versus pathology may differ across traditions, lineages, or even teachers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these models may only be immediately available to practitioners working closely with a teacher or Buddhist community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, even when traditional frameworks are available, these models may be inadequate for Western meditators who seek meditation for therapeutic reasons and who are embedded in a scientifically-oriented culture, where biomedical and psychological frameworks have a pervasive influence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wildman (2011) [156] suggests that the intense experiences of non-religious people are sometimes difficult to assimilate for the lack of any conceptual framework or social context for making sense of them, a point that may extend to practitioners unfamiliar with or uninterested in traditional conceptual frameworks or to those holding multiple, incompatible frameworks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is to say, it may be the case that some of the adverse responses to meditation experiences can be attributed to a lack of fit between practitioner goals and expectations and the normative frameworks of self-transformation found within the tradition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Western Buddhist practitioners not only have to navigate multiple interpretative frameworks, but also different opinions about which frameworks have authority.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarly, recent scholarship on religion and mental health has attempted to establish comparisonsespecially differencesbetween religious experiences and experiences associated with psychopathology, particularly schizophrenia and psychosis [8790].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these studies grapple with important issues of differential diagnosis, they tend to place an excessive emphasis on the role of belief in religious life, while overlooking the various changes in perception, affect, cognition, embodiment, and sense of self that are also reported in the context of both religious experiences and mental illnesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the experiences reported by practitioners in our study resemble to varying degrees phenomena discussed in the vast literature on schizophrenia, schizotypy, psychosis, as well as non-psychopathological forms of anomalous experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without sufficiently attending to the role of appraisal processes at both individual and interpersonal levels, scholars may fundamentally misconstrue differential diagnosis as being about identifying inherent differences between religious experiences and mental illnesses, rather than seeing them as potentially more ambiguous categories or closely related phenomena that may well be grounded in common cognitive, perceptual, and behavioral mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, an emphasis on intrinsic differences between religious experiences and psychopathology obscures the social and cultural processes through which experiences are deemed either religious or pathological [94].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many experiences reported in the VCE study are not unique to religious traditions and are, therefore, not intrinsically religious [157, 158].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through querying attributions of causality and ascriptions of meaning and value independently from phenomenology, we attempt to situate reports of experiences in the broader narrative and cultural contexts of practitioners and their communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relevance_to_meditation-based_programs_and_centers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current study did not directly investigate meditation-related difficulties in mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some practitioners in our study engaged in types of meditation practices (e.g., visualization), in contexts (e.g., long term retreat), and with motivations (e.g., attainment of religious goals) quite different from MBIs, a number of participants also reported challenging or difficult experiences under similar conditions as MBIs, that is: in the context of daily practice; while meditating less than 1 hour per day, or within the first 50 hours of practice; and with an aim of health, well-being or stress-reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some types of practice associated with challenging meditation experiences were in many cases not dissimilar from the primary components of MBIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many practitioners in our study reported difficulties associated with concentration practices (focused attention-type practices such as mindfulness of breathing), or insight practices (open monitoring-type practices), or a combination thereof [25, 159].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, MBI participants are encouraged to continue practicing after the 8-week program and are recommended to attend retreats at Buddhist meditation centers [160].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about participant trajectories beyond the 8-week program, as most follow-ups are less than 1 year and are rarely more than 3 years [161, 162].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that both MBIs and Buddhist meditation centers are based on Buddhist theory and practice [24, 25], and given that these same sources describe the possibility of periods of challenge or difficulty associated with practice, it makes sense that MBI providers and meditation teachers would be familiar with these challenges and know how to manage them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current study provides meditation teachers with a detailed taxonomy of potentially challenging experiences that could assist in the identification of students who may need additional support or corrective instruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such early identification has been shown to improve general and mitigate negative outcomes [163].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study also provides a preliminary list of remedies and management strategies, suggested by both experts and practitioners, as well as potential influencing factors that should be further investigated in both research and practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, research is beginning to identify practitioner-level factors, such as trauma history [61, 164] or psychiatric conditions [165], that may influence meditation-related outcomes or require modifications in teacher training, program structure, or inclusion and exclusion criteria [166].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Limitations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The purpose of this study is to document experiences that arise in the context of Buddhist meditation practices in Western contexts, with a deliberate effort to investigate challenging, difficult, distressing, and functionally impairing experiences that are often under-reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, using a qualitative methodology with a sample of Western Buddhist meditators across traditions is the best approach to be able to document the range of under-reported experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While suitable for the purposes of the current study, the methods also preclude certain types of conclusions, which are outlined below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Future_directions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current paper describes the methodology, coding structure, and basic findings of the Varieties of Contemplative Experience study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future papers will address specific aspects of both phenomenology and influencing factors as well as their relationship to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When focusing on specific categories or domains of phenomenology and/or influencing factors, future publications will engage directly with coded interview content, and categories that currently have extensive and diverse content will be subject to further thematic content analysis through the creation of data-driven and theory-driven subcategories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As practiced in a paper of preliminary data on visual phenomena [126], VCE study publications also aim to generate empirically tractable neurobiological hypotheses on the range of effects associated with meditation by engaging with scientific literature on meditation in tandem with research on related experiences from psychological and neuroscientific studies of phenomena such as depersonalization disorder, trauma, or sensory deprivation, for example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interdisciplinary approach adopted in this study also requires attending to how such experiences are appraised and potentially differentiated from similar phenomena, in both Buddhist textual sources as well as in the reports of practitioners and experts in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypotheses generated from reports of understudied meditation-related phenomena can then be used to guide future research in the psychology and neuroscience of meditation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study provides initial descriptions of experience that warrant further investigation in both research and clinical settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For more detailed information about the strength and direction of influence, the field needs well-controlled longitudinal studies on meditators employing a questionnaire assessing meditation-related experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The taxonomy of meditation-related experiences developed through the current study forms the foundation for such a questionnaire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An instrument based upon the phenomenology codebook has been pilot tested in a randomized controlled trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy [176] and is undergoing revision for wide-scale dissemination in future meditation research studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three studies that follow the VCE study methodology are also currently underway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One study is a sample of practitioners and teachers from Jewish, Christian, and Sufi traditions (PI: NF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons between the core VCE data set of Buddhist practitioners and the practitioners from Abrahamic traditions will facilitate an understanding of which types of experiences may be unique to a particular practice tradition, as well as which experiences are reported in common, despite differences in contemplative practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will also illuminate the importance of worldviews and conceptual frameworks in the interpretation of experiences that are common to both data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second study of European Buddhist meditators is also underway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons between this study and our data set, which is largely comprised of American practitioners, has the potential to enhance our understanding of the influence of sociocultural context, isolating variables that might be unique to American and European contexts, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, a third study will compare meditation practitioners and experts in the United States with practitioners and experts of the same tradition in India in order to assess the influence of cultural contexts on phenomenology and appraisals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the study also aims to provide resources and practical methods to facilitate the integration of difficult experiences that meditation practitioners report as being initially unexpected or challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future papers will investigate particularly distressing and functionally impairing symptoms along with an assessment of potential risk factors and possible remedies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent analyses will also examine the convergences as well as the discrepancies between practitioners experiences and experts awareness of and management of those experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have partnered with a number of meditation centers in the US and Europe and are offering educational materials and trainings as part of their meditation teacher-training programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These resources could be of benefit not only to practitioners and meditation instructors, but also to the burgeoning application of meditation techniques in psychology and medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
