Cost-effectiveness of multidisciplinary care in mild to moderate chronic kidney disease in the United States: A modeling study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Background  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multidisciplinary care (MDC) programs have been proposed as a way to alleviate the cost and morbidity associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the US.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods_and_findings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a theoretical Medicare-based MDC program for CKD compared to usual CKD care in Medicare beneficiaries with stage 3 and 4 CKD between 45 and 84 years old in the US.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The program used nephrologists, advanced practitioners, educators, dieticians, and social workers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From Medicare claims and published literature, we developed a novel deterministic Markov model for CKD progression and calibrated it to long-term risks of mortality and progression to end-stage renal disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used the model to project accrued discounted costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over patients remaining lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of MDC, or the cost of the intervention per QALY gained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDC added 0.23 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.42) QALYs over usual care, costing $51,285 per QALY gained (net monetary benefit of $23,100 at a threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained; 95% CI: $6,252, $44,323).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all subpopulations analyzed, ICERs ranged from $42,663 to $72,432 per QALY gained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDC was generally more cost-effective in patients with higher urine albumin excretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ICERs were higher in younger patients, MDC could yield greater improvements in health in younger than older patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDC remained cost-effective when we decreased its effectiveness to 25% of the base case or increased the cost 5-fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The program costed less than $70,000 per QALY in 95% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses and less than $87,500 per QALY in 99% of analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limitations of our study include its theoretical nature and being less generalizable to populations at low risk for progression to ESRD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not study the potential impact of MDC on hospitalization (cardiovascular or other).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our model estimates that a Medicare-funded MDC program could reduce the need for dialysis, prolong life expectancy, and meet conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds in middle-aged to elderly patients with mild to moderate CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 10% of Medicare beneficiaries in the US but accounts for a disproportionate 20% of expenditures [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are more costly, representing 1.6% of Medicare beneficiaries and responsible for 7.2% of costs [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, life expectancy is substantially lower in patients with CKD than in the general population [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multidisciplinary care (MDC) has been proposed as a way to mitigate the high costs and mortality associated with CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has led to successful outcomes in other settings, including heart failure [4], intensive care [5], and cancer [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CKD, researchers have investigated a variety of strategies, including nurse and advanced practitioner coordinated models [712], use of dieticians and social workers [79,12,13], and education programs [1419].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several systematic reviews have shown that MDC slows CKD progression [20], delays the onset of dialysis, and decreases mortality [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Little is known about the cost-effectiveness of MDC in a US CKD population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although prior studies have suggested that MDC is cost-effective, these studies were performed in other countries and did not use validated models for CKD progression [22,23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing an accurate model is challenging because CKD progression is associated with mortality, and previous studies did not account for this relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these studies did not consider heterogeneity in CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many patients with mild to moderate CKD do not progress to ESRD and may not benefit from an intensive disease management program [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Determining the subgroups that benefit the most from MDC may help providers more effectively treat vulnerable patients with CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of a theoretical Medicare MDC program for US populations of differing CKD severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did so after developing a novel CKD progression model that incorporates disease heterogeneity and mortality risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for inefficiencies in a nationally funded and broadly applied MDC program, we also tested if more expensive and less effective programs remained cost-effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that MDC is more cost-effective in patients with more severe CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also hypothesized that even an inefficiently deployed program would be cost-effective by conventional thresholds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overview_and_non-technical_modeling_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To model the cost-effectiveness of MDC in CKD, our analysis involved 3 elements: (1) we constructed and calibrated a CKD progression model; (2) we modeled the cost-effectiveness of MDC; and (3) we performed multiple sensitivity analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the effectiveness of MDC varies for different types of patients, we performed these analyses in US patients of different ages (4564, 6574, and 7584 years old), sexes (female and male), races (white, black, and other), estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs ranging from 20 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 5-ml/min/1.73 m2 increments), and approximate albuminuria levels (urine albumin to creatinine ratio [UACR] 1, 300, 1,000, and 3,000 mg/g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For our CKD progression model, we used a deterministic Markov model that simulates the disease course of patients with CKD as they experience progressive CKD, ESRD, and death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model accounts for population-level heterogeneity, including differences in age, sex, and race as well as eGFR and albuminuria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, patients with lower eGFRs and patients with higher levels of albuminuria are more likely to develop ESRD in our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, older patients have higher mortality rates in our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that our model accurately simulated CKD progression and mortality, we calibrated it to long-term mortality rates and ESRD incidence rates, which we obtained from published literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show results from our calibration procedure in S2 Appendix to demonstrate that our progression model accurately reflects published literature for different subpopulations with CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a theoretical Medicare-funded MDC program in the US, we used our CKD progression model to simulate the total lifetime costs and outcomes (as measured by quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of medical care for patients under MDC versus under usual care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After discounting total accrued costs and QALYs by an annual rate of 3%, we computed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), the difference in discounted costs divided by the difference in discounted QALYs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceptually, the ICER is the number of dollars that Medicare must spend on MDC to gain 1 QALY.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed that a cost-effective program would have an ICER of no more than $150,000 per QALY, which corresponds roughly to the 2017 inflation-adjusted ICER for dialysis ($129,000 per QALY in 2009) [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the literature, MDC spans different interventions and has been used in patients of varying disease severities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aims of MDC programs have ranged from slowing the progression of CKD to ESRD, to preventing cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, to optimizing decision-making at the onset of ESRD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We limited our study to MDC programs that aimed to slow the progression of CKD to ESRD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not incorporate the reduction of cardiovascular hospitalizations or prevention of acute kidney injury into our model because it is not clear from the literature whether MDC is effective in preventing these outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that our study assessed reductions in all-cause mortality and thus implicitly assessed reductions in cardiovascular mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the absence of data on the effect of MDC on intermediate cardiovascular endpoints, we were unable to incorporate cardiovascular or other hospitalizations into our cost-effectiveness estimates directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additionally, the literature often conflates MDC programs aimed at slowing the progression of CKD with MDC programs aimed at optimizing dialysis planning through reducing the use of tunneled dialysis catheters and improving the use of home dialysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these programs are operationally distinct and are meant for different populations: the former are typically used in patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD, while the latter are reserved for patients on the cusp of needing dialysis, with late stage 4 or early stage 5 CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our interest was in earlier interventions focused on slowing the progression of CKD to ESRD in patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These MDC programs typically comprise periodic visits with nephrologists, advanced practitioners, educators, dieticians, and social workers, which ramp up in frequency as CKD becomes more severe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed that MDC increased the use of medications and laboratory tests routinely used to manage anemia and derangements in bone-mineral metabolism, common in patients with CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a recently published systematic review, we constructed a model that estimated the effectiveness of MDC in reducing mortality and in preventing ESRD [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This review, and the published literature in general, provided an estimate of the average effectiveness of MDC across many severities of CKD, without accounting for population-level heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To incorporate the clinical intuition that many patients with earlier stages of CKD do not progress to ESRD and thus may not benefit from an MDC program, we assumed that MDC was less effective in patients with less severe CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because a Medicare-funded MDC program would likely have a large range of effectiveness and cost, we performed a wide array of sensitivity analyses varying our assumptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did so by repeating our analyses under different scenarios, where MDC was down to only 25% as effective as the base case or up to 5 times more expensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also simulated scenarios where MDC did not have any effect on CKD progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each scenario, we performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, which allowed us to produce cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and 95% confidence intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Below, we describe the technical specifications of our modeling technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Incremental_costs_and_outcomes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that MDC improved health by 0.23 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.42) QALYs per person over usual care, from 1.78 to 2.01 QALYs (Tables 69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This translated to hazard ratios of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.92) for death and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.86) for progression to ESRD (Tables 1013).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The improvement in outcomes was more pronounced for younger patients, with 4564 year olds seeing a higher increase in QALYs (95% CI: 0.310.76) than 7584 year olds (95% CI: 0.090.31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across different races, sexes, and eGFRs, the gain in health was similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with higher levels of albuminuria generally gained fewer QALYs than those with lower levels of albuminuria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, patients with a UACR of approximately 3,000 mg/g gained fewer QALYs (95% CI: 0.090.33) than patients with no albuminuria (UACR approximately 1 mg/g) (95% CI: 0.220.76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, relative gains in QALYs were similar across different levels of albuminuria (a 9% to 33% increase versus a 10% to 19% increase, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On average, MDC cost $12,001 (95% CI: $5,098, $19,358) more than usual care per patient over the lifetime, an increase from $68,571 to $80,572 (Tables 69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding ICER was $51,285 per QALY gained, which was cost-effective at a threshold of $150,000 per QALY (net monetary benefit of $23,100; 95% CI: $6,252, $44,323).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ICERs ranged from $42,663 to $72,432 per QALY gained in all subgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, MDC was more expensive in patients with lower levels of albuminuria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, patients with a UACR of 1 mg/g had ICERs of $55,315 to $57,958 per QALY gained versus $48,323 to $50,916 per QALY gained in patients with a UACR of 1,000 mg/g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, younger patients tended to have higher ICERs, though these higher relative expenses brought forth greater improvements in health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effectiveness_sensitivity_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MDC remained cost-effective at the WTP threshold of $150,000 per QALY in most sensitivity analyses where we varied its effectiveness (Tables 14 and S9S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when the program was only 25% as effective as the base case, MDC was cost-effective on average in the entire population, with an ICER of $127,927 per QALY gained, though the 95% confidence interval for net monetary benefit did cross $0 (net monetary benefit of $1,076; 95% CI: $2,194, $4,088).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponded to hazard ratios of 0.95 for death and 0.91 for progression to ESRD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, MDC was not cost-effective when operating at 25% effectiveness in patients with an eGFR of 59 ml/min/1.73 m2 and UACR of 1 mg/g (ICER $151,869 per QALY) (S9 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we assumed that MDC did not attenuate progression to ESRD and was only 25% as effective as the base case in preventing death (hazard ratios of 0.930.97 for death and 1.001.02 for progression to ESRD), the program was not cost-effective in all subgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cost_sensitivity_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In all scenarios that varied the cost, we found that point estimates for the ICERs were less than $150,000 per QALY gained (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDC remained cost-effective even when we increased the monthly cost 5-fold, although the upper end of the 95% confidence interval exceeded our threshold for cost-effectiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, MDC remained cost-effective when it increased the use of medications and laboratory tests in 100% of the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the upper end of the 95% confidence interval for patients without albuminuria exceeded $150,000 per QALY gained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For patients with higher levels of albuminuria, the 95% confidence interval remained less than $150,000 per QALY gained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cost sensitivity analyses, we found that MDC was more expensive in patients without albuminuria versus those with UACR of 300 or 1,000 mg/g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Probabilistic_sensitivity_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the base case, we found that MDC was cost-effective in over 99% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses at a threshold of $87,500 per QALY and in over 95% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses at a threshold of $70,000 per QALY (Fig 3A3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all subgroups, we found that MDC cost less than $150,000 per QALY in over 99% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although findings were similar across eGFR levels, MDC tended to have a lower probability of cost-effectiveness for patients with less albuminuria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When we decreased the effectiveness of MDC to 50% of the base case, we found that the program was cost-effective with 98% probability at a threshold of $150,000 per QALY (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the probability dropped to 74% under the scenario where the program was 25% as effective as the base case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability of cost-effectiveness dropped further when we assumed MDC only affected mortality and not progression to ESRD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In most cost sensitivity analyses, the probability that MDC was cost-effective was greater than 95% at a threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, once we increased the cost of MDC 5-fold (relative to the base case), the probability declined to 89%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using data from literature, we developed and calibrated a deterministic Markov model that accurately models disease progression of patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD and accounts for population heterogeneity including age, sex, race, severity of kidney disease, and albuminuria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this model, we found that a Medicare-funded MDC program in non-dialysis-requiring (eGFR 20 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m2) CKD is cost-effective in middle-aged to elderly patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although cost-effective in all subgroups, the program is more cost-effective in patients with more advanced CKD, particularly those with higher levels of albuminuria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Provision of MDC to younger patients was more expensive, but younger patients gained the most in health outcomes, as measured by QALYs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, MDC remained cost-effective even if it was 5 times more expensive or one-quarter as effective as our base case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Treating CKD requires effective management across multiple dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood pressure control, especially the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, is a mainstay of care [57,58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reducing cardiovascular risk factors and managing diet, fluid, and electrolyte balance are also important adjuncts [59,60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Medication and dietary non-adherence are prevalent and can limit the success of CKD treatment [61,62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MDC in CKD could help bridge the gap between successful scientific advances and lagging population health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since CKD is a heterogeneous disease, determining subgroups that benefit most is important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Younger patients and those with less albuminuria gained the most QALYs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are likely due to longer baseline life expectancy, since we found similar relative gains in health in all subpopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This probably explains why MDC is more expensive in younger patients and patients with less albuminuria, since a longer lifespan leads to additional healthcare spending, including on MDC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we found that MDC represents excellent value potential for patients with higher levels of albuminuria, where slowing kidney progression can delay the onset of dialysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study could help providers and program developers identify the subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from MDC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surprisingly, MDC was cost-effective, albeit more expensive, in patients without albuminuria, suggesting that MDC may be worthwhile in this population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The added expense is likely due to poor generalizability of MDC to patients without albuminuria who are at low risk for developing ESRD [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though MDC was cost-effective in this group on average, many such patients probably would not benefit from an intensive MDC program, especially one that aims to slow progression to ESRD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In patients without albuminuria, benefits from MDC probably reflect reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease rather than slowed CKD progression [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was corroborated by our sensitivity analysis in which we assumed that MDC did not attenuate progression to ESRD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, MDC remained cost-effective, except under the most pessimistic scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies of MDC could focus on disentangling the components of MDC that reduce cardiovascular complications and mortality from those that slow progression to ESRD, which would increase its applicability to patients without albuminuria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Few studies have attempted to assess the economic impact of MDC in CKD, and none to our knowledge has used a CKD progression model incorporating disease heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several simulation studies have suggested that more optimally managing CKD could lead to up to $20,000 of savings per patient (17,700 per patient) [22] and $60 billion annually [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these studies aimed to quantify only the savings associated with slowing progression to ESRD, they did not consider the cost of the intervention used to improve CKD management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the cost of an MDC program would likely exceed potential savings from preventing the onset of ESRD, but that these excess costs would be relatively modest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies using data from MDC trials also reported that MDC could lead to cost savings [10,17,41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these studies did not incorporate the cost of anemia and bone-mineral metabolism management, which can be expensive, and none accrued costs over patients lifetimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results indicate that a US Medicare-funded MDC program would likely have significant costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is unlikely that healthcare providers would independently deploy such a program without reimbursement, since MDC could cost a provider seeing 100 patients with CKD $800,000 to $2,000,000 annually, assuming Medicare reimburses at marginal cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could explain why MDC has not had widespread adoption, especially as Medicare has begun rewarding providers for demonstrating cost savings [6466].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we did not show a reduction in Medicare expenditures, we found that modest investment in CKD care management could yield substantial gains in health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, our findings in patients 4564 years of age could be extended to non-Medicare US healthcare payers because the vast majority of patients do not qualify for Medicare until they turn 65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beneficiaries of these healthcare payers potentially have the most to gain, since MDC is especially beneficial for younger patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Other countries could also see improvements in health with small investments in MDC programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The global prevalence of CKD is reported to be 8%16% worldwide and continues to grow [6769].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDC in CKD has been successfully tested in non-US populations, including in Canada [7,15,16,42,46,70], the United Kingdom [43], France [44], Italy [70], the Netherlands [11], South Korea [14], and Taiwan [17,19,41,45,47,48], and could reduce the growing need for renal replacement at reasonable cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In developing countries with poor access to renal replacement, MDC could be an inexpensive alternative to providing dialysis, which requires additional investment in infrastructure and capital [71,72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although Wang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  reported that MDC reduces mortality and ESRD in CKD [21], we believe that their effectiveness estimates were inflated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the included studies were not randomized controlled trials, and probably reflected populations likely to benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, providers actively investigating MDC are probably among the best at care management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Implementing a national program may be less efficient, especially if adherence to the program is modest or poor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems unlikely that a large-scale MDC program would be as effective as our base case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when we tested programs with much smaller effect sizes, MDC remained cost-effective, particularly in more severe kidney disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testing MDC programs that were less effective than our base case also allowed us to capture scenarios where patient adherence is poor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, Medicare would probably benefit from pursuing a cautious approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our most pessimistic scenario was not cost-effective, especially in patients with mild to moderate, non-proteinuric CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Implementing a pilot program for patients vulnerable to progressing to ESRD could increase the certainty that a nationally implemented program would be cost-effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study had some important limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the literature likely overestimates the effectiveness of MDC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attempted to address this issue by using conservative estimates for our base case and by extensively testing changes in cost and effectiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that substantially less effective programs remained cost-effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, our simulations relied on a calibrated model based on reported CKD progression and mortality rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from published literature have limited generalizability, and although we accounted for population-level heterogeneity, our model cannot fully incorporate differences in patient factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, although our model was novel in that it accounted for aspects of population-level heterogeneity, including age, sex, race, and severity of kidney disease, our model was unable to capture other known determinants of CKD progression such as socioeconomic status [7375].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, our analysis relied on prior studies that did not generally stratify effectiveness by CKD stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We accounted for this by assuming that MDC was less effective in milder stages of CKD and by varying its effectiveness in different CKD stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we limited our investigation to patients with mild to moderate CKD and only studied the effect of MDC on CKD progression and all-cause mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the absence of data on the effect of MDC on intermediate endpoints, we were unable to incorporate cardiovascular or other hospitalizations into our cost-effectiveness estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strengths of our study include our development and calibration of a novel CKD progression model, which was able to reliably reproduce long-term rates of mortality and progression to ESRD in many different subpopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this model, we were able to detect variation in the cost-effectiveness of MDC that incorporates heterogeneity in the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model is also flexible enough to allow investigators to test other interventions in patients with CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we tested a wide swath of effectiveness and cost scenarios, and our results were robust to these changes except in the most pessimistic scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our probabilistic sensitivity analysis allowed us to simultaneously test variation in all our parameters while accounting for correlations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By fitting our parameters to probability distributions, we were able to ensure that the joint distribution of our model fit parameters reported in literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, our model estimates suggest that a Medicare-funded MDC program, even if implemented with modest efficiency, is likely to be cost-effective in middle-aged to elderly patients with mild to moderate CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reimbursing providers for intensive disease management could be a relatively inexpensive way to improve the health of patients with CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
