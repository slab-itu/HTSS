I wouldnt be surprised to find my work on a politician-generated list of ridiculous, wasteful research projects: Scientists examine how poop bacteria activate polio, an eradicated virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I have worked on poliovirus for 16 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We work on other viruses too, but poliovirus has led to some of our most important discoveries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many people only know polio as a paralytic disease that was eradicated from the United States decades ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So why are we studying an eradicated virus?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Poliovirus is an incredible model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It grows like a weed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can make virus stocks containing 1010 infectious viruses without even trying very hard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For perspective, if these 10,000,000,000 viruses were dollar bills, the stack would be 68 miles high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Working with poliovirus is safe due to vaccination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can make targeted mutations in the genome and generate mutant polioviruses within days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are mouse strains that can be infected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, poliovirus has been studied for over 100 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We know a lot about poliovirus and we have great tools in our toolbox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If youre going to tackle a tough problem, it helps to have a great toolbox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For other fields, the ideal toolbox may be fruit flies, worms, or yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these model systems have illuminated biology and have led to major advancements in human health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What have we learned using poliovirus?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a postdoctoral fellow in Karla Kirkegaards lab, I used poliovirus to show that RNA viruses benefit from a sloppy replication strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many viruses, including Ebola, Zika, and influenza, have RNA as their genetic material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replication of RNA by viral enzymes generates mutations, like a fast typist without spellchecker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these mutations are damaging to the virus, but some can be beneficial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By isolating a mutant poliovirus that generated fewer mutations, I showed that a sloppy replication strategy benefits the virus by conferring adaptability during infection of animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marco Vignuzzi, then in Raul Andinos lab, published similar results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long story short, Marco and I began as competitors but are now great friends (see https://storify.com/HarmitMalik/on-one-of-the-enduring-friendships-in-virology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marcos lab has since shown that other viruses, including chikungunya, also rely on sloppy replication for optimal fitness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several groups are exploring viruses with altered fidelity as vaccine candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the end, our work with poliovirus was applicable to many viruses and may lead to new vaccine strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over the past several years, my lab has shown that intestinal bacteria promote infection with poliovirus and other gut viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we used antibiotics to deplete bacteria from mice, poliovirus replication and disease was reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that poliovirus sticks to bacteria, which aids viral infection and transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tatyana Golovkinas lab showed similar effects for another model virus, mouse mammary tumor virus, and our papers were published together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since then, several groups have shown that a variety of gut viruses rely on intestinal bacteria for infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of my favorite examples is Stephanie Karsts work with human norovirus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Norovirus infections are common and miserable, with explosive vomiting and diarrhea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we know relatively little about human norovirus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of 40 years of effort, human norovirus could not be cultured in the lab, which severely limited progress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only method to study viral replication was to infect human volunteers!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human stool samples were filtered to remove bacteria to generate virus preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stephanie is a friend and knew about our poliovirus results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  She added bacteria back to her virus samples, and then the virus could replicate in cultured cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to grow human norovirus in the lab is a huge advance that could lead to new treatment or prevention strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And it all started in small labs with curiosity-driven studies using poliovirus and mouse mammary tumor virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The value of model systems and curiosity-driven basic science research is immense, but we often fail to convey this to the general public, to those in political office, and even to other scientists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some scientists put a premium on clinical or translational relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a project need not have disease relevance to have high merit, basic science grant proposals can suffer a penalty from biased reviewers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When communicating their work, many scientists start with a description of the disease burden of their pathogen to highlight significance, rather than discussing why their biological question is interesting or important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its easy to understand why some nonscientists have trouble understanding the value of model systems when some scientists have the same problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A diversified portfolio of research projects is neededtranslational and basic science, model systems and disease models, and big data collaborative projects and investigator-initiated projects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But I hope that there will always be support for scientists that geek out over fruit flies, worms, yeast, or nearly eradicated viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
