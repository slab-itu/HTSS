Disrupting Mosquito Reproduction and Parasite Development for Malaria Control  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The control of mosquito populations with insecticide treated bed nets and indoor residual sprays remains the cornerstone of malaria reduction and elimination programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of widespread insecticide resistance in mosquitoes, however, alternative strategies for reducing transmission by the mosquito vector are urgently needed, including the identification of safe compounds that affect vectorial capacity via mechanisms that differ from fast-acting insecticides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that compounds targeting steroid hormone signaling disrupt multiple biological processes that are key to the ability of mosquitoes to transmit malaria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When an agonist of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is applied to Anopheles gambiae females, which are the dominant malaria mosquito vector in Sub Saharan Africa, it substantially shortens lifespan, prevents insemination and egg production, and significantly blocks Plasmodium falciparum development, three components that are crucial to malaria transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modeling the impact of these effects on Anopheles population dynamics and Plasmodium transmission predicts that disrupting steroid hormone signaling using 20E agonists would affect malaria transmission to a similar extent as insecticides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manipulating 20E pathways therefore provides a powerful new approach to tackle malaria transmission by the mosquito vector, particularly in areas affected by the spread of insecticide resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mosquito control is the only intervention that can reduce malaria transmission from very high levels to close to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, current mosquito control methods are severely threatened by the rapid spread of insecticide resistance in anopheline mosquito populations that transmit the malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that when steroid hormone signaling is interrupted in female Anopheles mosquitoes, various aspects of their lifecycle are disruptedfemales produce and lay fewer eggs, do not mate successfully and die more rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, they become less likely to be infected by malaria parasites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we model the impact of steroid hormone agonists on malaria transmission, we predict that these compounds would provide an important new tool against malaria, particularly in regions of widespread insecticide resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite recent progress in combating the malaria parasite, nearly 200 million infections and around 500,000 deaths are caused by malaria annually, mostly in young children in sub-Saharan Africa [1, 2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with new drugs and vaccines in the research pipeline [3], control of the Anopheles species that transmit human malaria remains the cornerstone of prevention and transmission reduction efforts [2, 4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the four classes of insecticides available for malaria control, pyrethroids are the only compounds approved for use on long-lasting insecticide-impregnated bed nets (LLINs), due to their relatively low toxicity, and they are heavily used in indoor residual spray (IRS) programs [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a major limitation, as the increased application of both interventions over the last decade has inevitably led to the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance in natural mosquito populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, resistance to pyrethroids has been observed in most Anopheles populations from sub-Saharan Africa [6], making the identification of alternative non-toxic compounds that can reduce parasite transmission a high priority in the malaria control agenda [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insecticide-based interventions impact malaria transmission by increasing the mortality rate of exposed female mosquitoes and, in the case of LLINs, by preventing them from biting humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mathematical models developed to aid in the design of malaria elimination programs during the first global eradication campaign showed the importance of increasing mosquito mortality [7, 8], which reduces the probability that mosquitoes will survive for the 1214 day incubation period of the malaria parasite [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, other aspects of adult mosquito biology that determine vectorial capacity, such as host preferences for blood-feeding, susceptibility to parasite development, and reproductive fitness, have not yet been fully exploited for malaria control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anopheles population densities are driven by the complex mosquito lifecycle involving multiple gonotrophic cycles in fertilized females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a single insemination event, a female stores sperm for her lifetime, using it to fertilize each egg batch produced after a blood meal [1012].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the processes characterizing this reproductive cycle are regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), a steroid hormone originally studied in insects for its fundamental role in larval molting [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides an essential function of female-produced 20E in triggering egg development after blood feeding [1416], in Anopheles gambiae, as well as in other important anopheline vector species, sexual transfer of this hormone by the male induces a dramatic series of molecular events that culminate in increased oogenesis, induction of egg laying, and loss of the females susceptibility to further mating [1720].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on its multiple physiological effects, it is reasonable to speculate that 20E signaling pathways in the female mosquito could be exploited to manipulate reproductive success and possibly other aspects of mosquito biology that are relevant for vectorial capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, synthetic 20E non-steroidal agonists such as dibenzoylhydrazines (DBHs), which mimic the action of 20E by competitively binding to the ecdysteroid receptor, resulting in high ecdysteroid activity [21, 22], could be utilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When provided to larvae of some Lepidopteran and Dipteran species, DBHs induce precocious and incomplete molting, ultimately leading to death [2125].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These compounds have extremely low toxicity to mammals and are non-carcinogenic [26, 27], and although reduced fitness of adult stages following DBH exposure has been documented in agricultural lepidopteran species [24], their potential use against adult stages of malaria vectors has not been tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we show that topical application of the non-steroidal ecdysone agonist methoxyfenozide (a DBH compound, herein referred to as DBH) significantly limits the reproductive success of adult An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae females and greatly increases their mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, females exposed to DBH are significantly less susceptible to infection with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We incorporate our experimental findings into a mathematical model of the mosquito life cycle to determine the potential impact of these multiple biological effects on mosquito population dynamics and malaria transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the application of compounds targeting ecdysteroid pathways on impregnated bed nets or in indoor spray programs would significantly reduce malaria transmission, achieving results comparable to those from the use of insecticides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manipulating 20E signaling in Anopheles mosquitoes therefore provides a new strategy for malaria control, especially needed in areas of widespread resistance to insecticides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Disrupting_steroid_hormone_signaling_in_An_gambiae_females_affects_mosquito_traits_central_to_vectorial_capacity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if steroid hormone signaling could be disrupted to manipulate entomological parameters key to malaria transmission, we treated An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae females with the 20E agonist DBH and assessed its effects on egg laying and mating success, two reproductive traits that can impact mosquito population size and hence the frequency of encounters with the human host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While 20E is essential for egg development in insects, it has been shown that levels above a critical threshold can induce apoptosis of ovarian follicles [28, 29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore reasoned that topical application of DBH to the females thorax might disrupt egg development and thus reduce the number of eggs laid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, as 20E injections in virgin females completely abolish insemination in a number of Anopheles species [20], we tested whether exposure to DBH might achieve the same result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also expected an effect of DBH application on female mortality, as, in Drosophila melanogaster, 20E is known to regulate longevity [30, 31], a crucial parameter of malaria transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Egg laying, mating, and lifespan were all significantly altered in females treated with this 20E agonist (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first tested mated females for their ability to develop and lay eggs when exposed to DBH 24h prior to blood feeding at 5 different doses (ranging in a 2-fold dilution series from 2 g 0.125 g per mosquito, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While 100% of the control females oviposited after a blood meal, females exposed to DBH showed a dose-dependent reduction in oviposition, with 47.4% of individuals laying eggs at the intermediate dose (0.5 g) and only 10.9% at the highest dose (2 g) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ED50 dose of 0.5 g (0.080.13 95% CI) was determined from the dose-response curve (slope: 2.32, R = 0.993).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, even in cases where females oviposited, we detected at the three highest doses a significant reduction in the number of eggs laid, with a median egg number of zero compared to a median of 91.5 eggs in the control group (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon dissection of individuals in all DBH-exposed groups, we found that 98.7% of females had no follicular growth or yolk deposition in the ovaries despite having fully engorged on blood, demonstrating that the reduction in oviposition rates was due to impaired oogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe induction of autogenous egg development after exposure contrary to what is reported in culicine mosquitoes after DBH treatment in larvae [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microscopic analysis of ovaries after terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays detected extensive fragmentation of chromatin, indicative of apoptosis, limited to the primary ovarian follicles of treated females 24h after DBH exposure, while control females had no observable apoptosis and had otherwise normal follicular morphology (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar apoptotic follicles were observed after 20E injections, showing that the phenotype induced by DBH application recapitulates the effects induced by 20E (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that previous experiments where 20E injections induced egg laying [19] were performed in blood fed females that had completed egg development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mating and female longevity were also significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner compared to controls as a result of DBH exposure (Fig 1B and 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After treating virgin females with 3 DBH doses (0.125 g (low), 0.5 g (intermediate), and 2 g (high), corresponding approximately to the ED10, ED50 and ED90 from the oviposition data) and placing them with males for 2 days, we observed a 2565% reduction in insemination rates, as determined by the presence of sperm in the spermatheca (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, DBH-treated females showed an eight-day reduction in median survival time at the highest dose compared to controls (median survival time in 2 g DBH: 11 days; Control: 19 days) (Fig 1C), and lifespan was reduced even at the lowest dose (median survival time in 0.125 g DBH: 16 days).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall these results demonstrate a strong, dose-dependent effect of DBH on important determinants of vectorial capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DBH_strongly_impairs_development_of_P_falciparum_parasites_in_An_gambiae_females  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As 20E signaling is an important modulator of the females post-blood feeding physiology, we determined whether manipulating steroid hormone pathways via topical application of DBH also impacted the establishment of P. falciparum infection in the mosquito vector, using the three doses utilized in the mating and longevity assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. falciparum prevalence (NF54 strain) was significantly reduced 7 days post-infectious blood meal at the two higher DBH doses relative to the control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the highest dose, only 7.5% of females who fully engorged on an infectious blood meal were positive for oocysts, corresponding to an 87% reduction in infection prevalence relative to controls (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When using the intermediate dose, 25.8% of females failed to develop an infection, providing a 56% reduction in prevalence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limited effects were observed in the low dose treatment group, where oocyst prevalence (50.7%) was similar to the control group (58.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In those females that developed oocysts, the intensity of infection was not significantly affected (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Modeling_the_impact_of_DBH_on_mosquito_populations_predicts_a_shift_towards_younger_females  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed a discrete-time deterministic mathematical model of the mosquito life cycle (Fig 2, S1 Table) to predict the effect of manipulating steroid hormone signaling via DBH on Anopheles population dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We modeled mosquitoes through their life cycle, starting with juvenile aquatic stages (eggs, larvae, and pupae), followed by mating and up to six gonotrophic cycles consisting of blood feeding, resting, and ovipositing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used our experimental findings to define the efficacy of DBH in our model (S1 and S2 Tables, Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our experimental findings, at the highest dose the efficacy was defined to be a 95% reduction in egg batch size, 65% reduction in mating success, 87% reduction in Plasmodium infection risk, and an enhanced age-dependent mortality based on the experimental survival curves, with an 8-day reduction in median survival time (Fig 1, S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficacies defined for application of lower DBH doses can be found in S1 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the purpose of this modeling approach was to elucidate the qualitative impacts of the multiple effects of DBH on the non-linear mosquito lifecycle, rather than to make quantitative predictions about its impact in field conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We explicitly modeled the impact of DBH either delivered on impregnated bed nets to target females as they attempt to blood feed, or in indoor sprays to target females as they rest after feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our experimental results provide insight into a single exposure to DBH, and in order to compare with insecticide efficacy, we took a conservative approach and only considered possible exposure to DBH or insecticide to occur once, on the first feeding day in the case of treated bed nets or on the first indoor resting day for IRS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insecticide was modeled at 100%, 80%, and 60% efficacy to reflect a situation of partial resistance emerging in the mosquito population [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we examined varying levels of coverage, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the proportion of mosquitoes exposed in their first feed or first day of indoor rest (S3A Fig, Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To qualitatively examine the relative efficacy and general mechanisms of transmission reduction following a DBH-based intervention, we used a single well-mixed mosquito population without spatial structure (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The modeled mosquito population and its age structure were significantly altered by the use of DBH in bed nets and indoor residual sprays (Fig 3, S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationship between DBH exposure and mosquito population size was non-linear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the strongest dose and highest levels of coverage the mosquito population was driven to extinction, but for most levels of coverage the total adult mosquito population actually increased with DBH exposure due to reduced density-dependent larval mortality (Fig 3A, S5A Fig), consistent with previous models of vector control interventions [3436].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this effect was accompanied by a shift in the age distribution of adult females towards younger individuals (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the low and high DBH doses, for all levels of coverage, this shift alone reduced the proportion of females that lived long enough to transmit malaria, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  females surviving at least 12 days following their first blood meal (S5B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our experimental results show that DBH also blocks P. falciparum infection, we combined this shift in age structure with the dose-dependent reduction in susceptibility to estimate the overall impact on the fraction of potentially infectious mosquitoes (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison to insecticide exposure at the same coverage, low and intermediate doses of DBH showed a similar reduction in adult mosquitoes able to transmit malaria to that of 60% and 80% insecticide efficacy, respectively, while high DBH dose performed comparably if not better than a 100% effective insecticide (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delivery of DBH through indoor spraying showed similar effects on the mosquito population (S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Targeting_steroid_hormone_signaling_is_predicted_to_substantially_reduce_malaria_transmission  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the impact of DBH on malaria, we extended our mathematical framework to include malaria transmission with feedback between infectious human and mosquito populations (S6 Fig; S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the model, mosquitoes required at least 12 days following an infectious blood meal to become infectious to humans [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the non-linear relationships between components of the model, transmission intensity prior to interventions may influence their relative impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore considered three transmission settings, with high (85%), moderate (45%), and low (5%) malaria prevalence pre-intervention, and different DBH doses (2 g, 0.5 g, and 0.125 g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our results are not intended to quantitatively reproduce field conditions, but rather to reflect the relative reductions for a range of pre-intervention transmission settings and in comparison to the use of insecticides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned above, for simplicity we consider the effectiveness of each intervention to be the reduction in malaria prevalence after a single exposure relative to the pre-intervention prevalence, and in our model mosquitoes become exposed to DBH or insecticides only at the time of their first blood feeding (or their first day of indoor rest for IRS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Application of 2 g DBH via bed nets showed strong effectiveness against malaria prevalence, outcompeting the impact of any insecticide efficacy in all transmission settings (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of low and intermediate DBH doses were comparable to those of 60% and 80% insecticide efficacy respectively, regardless of initial malaria prevalence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effectiveness increased significantly with increasing coverage for all doses of DBH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar dynamics were observed when modeling DBH use in indoor sprays (S7 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the method of application or dose considered, a single exposure to DBH led to a reduction in malaria prevalence in all transmission settings at all coverage levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore expect that repeated exposures over the course of a females lifespan would have a larger impact on malaria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The development of non-toxic compounds that target the mosquito vector in novel ways will be essential for achieving malaria elimination goals [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study identifies steroid hormone signaling as a promising new target that can provide an effective and complementary approach to existing tools for vector control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our data are based on topical application, and therefore cannot directly be extrapolated to effectiveness in field settings, we observed a robust, dose-dependent impact of the steroid hormone agonist DBH on egg development, insemination rates, and adult female longevity in experimental applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, DBH strongly prevented the development of the deadliest human malaria parasite, P. falciparum, a highly desirable feature for any compound used in malaria control strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the effects on fecundity, insemination rates, and longevity are in agreement with previous studies linking high 20E activity to apoptosis of ovarian follicles [28, 29], reduced mating receptivity [19] and premature aging [30, 31], the observed reduction in P. falciparum infections was completely unexpected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In future studies it will be important to test steroid hormone agonists under field conditions, using different mosquito strains and parasite isolates, and to determine whether the effects on oogenesis and parasite development are linked, for example, via the induction of immune pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, recent studies targeting another insect hormone, the sesquiterpene juvenile hormone, have shown life shortening and sterilizing activity against adult Anopheles species [3740].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pyriproxyfen (PPF, a juvenile hormone analog) is currently available in LLINs for its combined efficacy with insecticides [37, 41, 42] although, to our knowledge, the effects of juvenile hormone agonism on Plasmodium development within the mosquito have not been tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon optimization and testing of DBH or other chemistries targeting steroidal pathways for tarsal uptake, alternating the use of steroid hormone and juvenile hormone agonists in combination with insecticides may provide the key to preventing the spread of resistance to conventional insecticides and extending their effectiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our experimental setting, DBH had biological efficacy by topical application at higher but still comparable doses to permethrin in mosquitoes exhibiting pyrethroid target-site resistance [43], which is an important factor when considering both the cost effectiveness and safety of using these substances in the fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explicitly considered only the acute lethality of insecticide exposure in our model as the overall toll that insecticide resistance and sub-lethal doses of insecticide may impose on mosquitoes and parasites is only now being investigated [44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the incidence and severity of resistance increases in wild populations, understanding the biological effects of sub-lethal insecticide exposure will be increasingly important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our modeling approach illustrates how the different actions of steroid hormone agonists interact in non-intuitive ways to change mosquito populations and malaria prevalence in comparison to insecticides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity we measured effectiveness after a single DBH exposure, and for consistency in our comparison we modeled contact with insecticide only during the first blood feeding cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus our model results provide a conservative estimate of the possible outcomes of DBH and insecticide exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this, they clearly indicate that steroid hormone agonists would perform comparably to insecticides in all malaria scenarios tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even at lower doses, when the individual effects on reproduction, longevity, and parasite development become less striking, the combination of these effects is powerful enough to achieve a substantial reduction in malaria, mostly due to a decrease in the potentially infectious adult female population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As observed in other modeling studies, the release of density-dependent mortality plays an important role in the predicted impact of interventions [3436].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For generalizability, we did not include fluctuations in carrying capacity, although variations in climatic conditions (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rainfall, temperature, humidity) that determine the availability and quality of larval breeding sites are clearly important factors in the field that prevent populations from reaching equilibrium [4548].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore likely that our framework is additionally conservative in that it over-estimates the increases in mosquito population size following DBH application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The counter-intuitive finding that malaria prevalence can be reduced even when mosquito population size increases highlights the importance of qualitative models of this kind that can identify potential multifactorial and non-linear effects of interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be important to validate the model and test the arising hypotheses in the field in future studies, since our results are qualitative and mechanistic, rather than providing quantitative predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the physiological effects we have examined here, compounds belonging to the DBH class have additional characteristics that make them promising tools for malaria vector control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DBHs are not toxic to mammals (LD50  5000 mg/kg by ingestion for methoxyfenozide, which compares favorably to the LD50 = 430 mg/kg by ingestion of the pyrethroid permethrin commonly used on LLINs) and would therefore be ideally suitable for bed net-based strategies, where low toxicity is essential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, although resistance to DBH has been experimentally induced in larvae from a number of insect agricultural pests and has been described in wild populations with varying reports on the possible biochemical and genetic basis [24, 4951], it has rapidly reversed when the intervention was withdrawn [24, 50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although resistance to DBH or any other active compound will inevitably occur at some point, different strategies such as rotation, mosaics, or combination with insecticide could be utilized to delay its emergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, interventions like DBH that have a combination of physiological effects and/or alter mosquito age structure, rather than causing instant lethality, may exert less selection pressure on targeted mosquitoes relative to conventional insecticidal approaches, whilst impacting malaria transmission to a similar degree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Plasmodium parasites could develop independent mechanisms of resistance against the as yet uncharacterized anti-parasitic activity exerted by DBH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this event, this could potentially uncouple the DBH effects on mosquito physiology from those on parasite development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the conserved role of 20E pathways in regulating female physiology in multiple anopheline species [20], we expect that compounds interfering with steroid signaling will be biologically effective against other important malaria vectors such as An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  arabiensis, An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  funestus, and An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  stephensi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approaches targeting these hormonal pathways could therefore be a potent addition to the limited toolbox of vector interventions for successful malaria control in Africa and other regions of the world affected by this disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
