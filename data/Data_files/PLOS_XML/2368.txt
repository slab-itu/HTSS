Inter-subunit interactions drive divergent dynamics in mammalian and Plasmodium actin filaments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell motility is essential for protozoan and metazoan organisms and typically relies on the dynamic turnover of actin filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In metazoans, monomeric actin polymerises into usually long and stable filaments, while some protozoans form only short and highly dynamic actin filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These different dynamics are partly due to the different sets of actin regulatory proteins and partly due to the sequence of actin itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we probe the interactions of actin subunits within divergent actin filaments using a comparative dynamic molecular model and explore their functions using Plasmodium, the protozoan causing malaria, and mouse melanoma derived B16-F1 cells as model systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parasite actin tagged to a fluorescent protein (FP) did not incorporate into mammalian actin filaments, and rabbit actin-FP did not incorporate into parasite actin filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, exchanging the most divergent region of actin subdomain 3 allowed such reciprocal incorporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exchange of a single amino acid residue in subdomain 2 (N41H) of Plasmodium actin markedly improved incorporation into mammalian filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the parasite, modification of most subunitsubunit interaction sites was lethal, whereas changes in actin subdomains 1 and 4 reduced efficient parasite motility and hence mosquito organ penetration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong penetration defects could be rescued by overexpression of the actin filament regulator coronin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through these comparative approaches we identified an essential and common contributor, subdomain 3, which drives the differential dynamic behaviour of two highly divergent eukaryotic actins in motile cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Actin is one of the most abundant and conserved proteins across eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its ability to assemble from individual monomers into dynamic polymers is essential for many cellular functions, including division and motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cells, actin is able to form long and stable filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an actin of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium, while having a very similar monomer structure to actins from other eukaryotes, forms only short and unstable filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These short and dynamic filaments are crucial in allowing the parasite to move very rapidly in tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigated the basis of these differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used molecular dynamics simulations of actin filaments to investigate the actinactin interfaces in filaments from Plasmodium and rabbit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next engineered parasites to express chimeric actins that contained different parts of rabbit and parasite actin and thereby identified actin residues important for parasite viability and progression across the life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could rescue the most prominent defect specifically with overexpression of the actin binding protein coronin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the more stable actin harms the parasite and that coronin helps in recycling filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By screening the effects of actin chimeras in mammalian cells, we also identified regions that allow these different actins to efficiently interact with each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results improve our understanding of the interactions required for actin to incorporate into filaments across divergent eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Actin is a highly conserved cytoskeletal protein with essential roles in cell division, contraction, and motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell motility is an important process in biological development, cancer metastasis, and tissue penetration by both immune cells and pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many eukaryotic cell types have the ability to move continuously in a substrate-dependent ameboid manner in both 2D and 3D environments, typically by deforming their cellular shape and protruding the cells leading edge [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gliding motility is an alternative mode of locomotion displayed by some bacteria and protists that is independent of cell shape changes [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium employs gliding motility in several phases of its life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gliding is essential for successful penetration of host organs such as the mosquito midgut and salivary glands as well as the mammalian liver [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior to liver infection, high motility speeds of 13 m/s allow the parasite to escape from the dermis, where it is deposited by the biting mosquito, and thereby evade infiltrating neutrophils, the fastest migrating human cells, which move much slower (15 m/min) [8,9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these striking differences in locomotion modes and speeds, the fundamental requirement for these cells is the dynamic turnover of actin filaments [1012].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The actin monomer has a highly conserved structure that consists of four subdomains and a central nucleotide (adenosine triphosphate [ATP], adenosine diphosphate with inorganic phosphate [ADP + Pi], or adenosine diphosphate alone [ADP]) binding cleft (Fig 1A) [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actin possesses the ability to self-assemble from monomers (G-actin) to form filaments (F-actin), which in turn can form higher order filamentous structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particular regions in the actin subdomains, such as the hydrophobic plug (H-plug) of subdomain 3 and the highly flexible DNAse I-binding loop (D-loop) of subdomain 2, as well as the nucleotide state, have been implicated as major contributors to the formation and stability of filaments [1416].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actin isoforms of most eukaryotes inherently form long and stable filament structures (greater than 1 m in length), display high sequence conservation across species ( greater than 90% similarity from yeast to humans), and are regulated by a large set of actin binding proteins (ABPs) [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ABPs can affect the monomer-filament ratio and fulfil a variety of regulatory roles, including but not limited to nucleation and elongation (e.g., formin), monomer binding (e.g., profilin), filament binding (e.g., coronin), and filament severing (e.g., cofilin/actin depolymerising factor [ADF] family).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, protozoan parasites express divergent actins (60%80% identity with vertebrate actins) that typically differ in their ability to form actin filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Giardia, trypanosomid, and apicomplexan actins are refractory to actin polymerisation modulating compounds, such as latruculin, and their structures are difficult to visualise with phalloidin [1821].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, actin 1 of Plasmodium has fundamental shifts in its functional properties: despite a similar monomer tertiary structure [22] to mammalian actin, Plasmodium actin only forms short filaments of approximately 100 nm in length, has a noncanonical filament structure that is dynamically unstable [16,2228], displays slow polymerisation yet rapid depolymerisation rates [29], and is regulated by a highly reduced set of predicted ABPs [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such altered properties are crucial for intracellular parasite growth [3133] and efficient parasite motility [12,31,3335].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fundamental differences make Plasmodium actin a useful model for the comparative assessment of key amino acid residues that result in altered filament properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we combined multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with three newly developed molecular genetic screens to identify the contribution of particular amino acid residues to the altered properties of canonical rabbit actin and the evolutionarily distant Plasmodium actin 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results reveal a distinct region in subdomain 3 as the primary contributor to divergent actin behaviour and filament incorporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Plasmodium actin 1 is one of the most divergent eukaryotic actins known (80% sequence identity compared to rabbit alpha actin, S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the structural and dynamic differences between actin monomers from parasites, as represented by Plasmodium actin 1, and canonical mammalian actin monomers, as represented by rabbit actin, we first employed all-atom MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from a more flexible region in subdomain 4, comparison of the breathing dynamics of the actin monomers revealed no marked differences in behaviour between the actins from the two species (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess actin filament dynamics, we constructed 15-mer Plasmodium and rabbit actin filaments based on electron microscopy (EM) data for the rabbit alpha actin filament [36] and performed five coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations of 10-s duration for each filament.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulations recapitulated the modified filament architecture observed in previous EM studies, in terms of alpha angle and subunits per crossover [16,22,27] (S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our models allowed for the comparative assessment of the dynamics of the molecular interactions both within and between subunits in the filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the filament models for the two species revealed that both filaments displayed essential common interaction hot spots in regions involved in intermolecular contacts (Fig 1B1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two interaction regions in subdomains 1 and 3 (designated S1b and S3a) are highly conserved across species (over 90% sequence identity of Plasmodium compared to rabbit alpha actin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other interaction regions corresponded to sequences in subdomains 2, 3b, and 4 (Fig 1E, overall sequence identities of 78%, 72%, and 77%, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, within these regions there are residue differences between Plasmodium and rabbit actin filaments and thus altered contacts between filament subunits (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, whereas the locations of the interfaces are conserved, the residues are, on average, more divergent at the interfaces than elsewhere (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Specific_regions_of_the_parasite_actin_sequence_affect_host_organ_penetration_and_efficient_motility  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We sought to assess the contribution of these divergent regions to the altered behaviour of actin species in their cellular context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a first unbiased screen, chimeras containing exchanges between Plasmodium and mammalian actin were generated and tested for their ability to replace the endogenous actin 1 gene in the parasite (Fig 2A and 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we established a two-step genetic methodology that allowed for replacement of the endogenous copy while leaving the desired locus selection marker free and with minimal flanking changes in the parasite genome (S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For rabbit actin-based chimeras, our screening approach revealed that any changes to this actin were insufficient to obtain viable parasite lines, strongly indicating that no one region is capable of full restoration of parasite-like actin function from a canonical backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even for exchanges introduced into the parasite actin, the majority of the parasite actin chimeras were unable to functionally replace the endogenous gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, changes to subdomains 2 and 3 of the parasite actin resulted in parasite death, indicating that these regions provide essential features required for parasite blood stage growth (the stage at which the genetic manipulations are performed, Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, mutants with single point mutations in these subdomains (P42Q and K270M) were also lethal, strongly implicating the essentiality of these regions for normal parasite function in the blood stages of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, two of the most divergent regions could be exchanged with the canonical mammalian actin equivalent regions: an N-terminal domain swap (PbS1aOc, residues 133, 67% sequence identity with rabbit alpha actin with one additional acidic residue on its N-terminus) and a subdomain 4 replacement (PbS4Oc, residues 182263, 77% sequence identity with rabbit alpha actin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, these transgenic parasites displayed asexual growth rates in the blood that were comparable to the wild-type replacement control (Fig 2C), suggesting that modification of these regions does not significantly affect intracellular growth and erythrocyte invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The malaria parasite needs to propagate and disseminate in a variety of tissue environments and different temperatures, suggesting that the required actin dynamics of these other stages could be different [37,38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus tested if the PbS1aOc and PbS4Oc chimeric lines were effective in infection of Anopheles mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After transmission to the mosquito midgut, the parasite develops into midgut-penetrating ookinetes, which can traverse the epithelia to establish oocysts on the basal lamina (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These oocysts produce thousands of sporozoites that are subsequently released into circulation and actively invade the insects salivary glands [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PbS1aOc produced slower moving ookinetes and reduced oocyst numbers (Fig 3A and 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, while the numbers of sporozoites in the mosquito circulation were within the usual range, suggesting normal oocyst development, a marked reduction in salivary gland occupancy and sporozoite motility was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PbS1aOc displayed a 50% reduction in parasite numbers in the salivary glands (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this line was capable of infecting naive mice at similar rates to wild-type controls (Fig 3D and 3E) and showed a similar motile population compared to wild-type controls (Fig 3F), these parasites moved at a lower average speed (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a modification of the N-terminal region of actin, with a concomitant increase in the number of acidic residues, resulted in a decreased motility of two different parasite stages, which affected their ability to penetrate the organs of the mosquito.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alteration of the amino acid residue composition of subdomain 4 (PbS4Oc) resulted in a much more pronounced defect in salivary gland invasion (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, this line was still able to cause infection in mice by natural mosquito transmission, although the decreased numbers of parasites in these glands resulted in a concomitant delay in infection (Fig 3D and 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The motile population of salivary glandresident parasites was reduced and these moved in a discontinuous fashion (Fig 3F3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, these parasites often paused during motility, a phenomenon not yet described for any Plasmodium mutant (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, such events were often accompanied by short reversals in direction and detachment at the rear of the parasite (Fig 3I and 3J, S1 Movie and S2 Movie).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While pausing did not change the average speed compared to wild-type, there was an increased range of speeds obtained by individual parasites (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Changing the subdomain 4 region involved the alteration of 20 amino acid residues to canonical equivalents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the pausing phenotype was also observed by combined modification of only three residues in this region (three combined parasite to mammalian residue mutants H195T, G200S, and E232A: mutant HGE/TSA) (Fig 3 and S5 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CG MD simulations with this triple mutant indicate that a change of these three residues results in a shift of filament parameters toward rabbit actin (S3 Fig) and an atypical interaction profile that is not observed in either species: residues F54 and Y189 display enhanced contacts with Y170 and H174, respectively, which could have consequences for actin filament turnover (S6 Fig) [16,36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, altering actin dynamics by mutation of nonessential actin regions results in parasites that, while behaving normally in the mammalian host, have prominent inabilities to effectively colonise the mosquito vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Overexpression_of_F-actin_binding_protein_coronin_restores_parasite_mosquito_colonisation_in_a_mutated_actin_line  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plasmodium actin cannot be visualised using typical imaging approaches [39], yet expressing the F-actin binding Plasmodium coronin fused with mCherry enabled visualisation of F-actin in motile sporozoites [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coronin localises at the periphery of nonmotile sporozoites and relocalises to the rear in motile sporozoites in an actin filamentdependent fashion [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate a possible change in localisation, we transfected PbS4Oc-expressing parasites with mCherry-tagged coronin under the control of a sporozoite-specific promoter (Fig 4A, S7 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curiously, coronin localised to the periphery in an actin-independent manner in these sporozoites resembling the localisation in nonmotile wild-type sporozoites or after treatment with the actin filament modulator cytochalasin D (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the majority of the tagged coronin was unable to bind the modified actin, similar to observations with a coronin actin binding mutant and when parasites are treated with filament stabiliser, jasplakinolide [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, overexpression of coronin, but not overexpression of profilin and ADF2, rescued efficient motility and salivary gland penetration of PbS4Oc sporozoites (Fig 4C4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of coronin in WT sporozoites also increased their capacity to move [37], suggesting that in PbS4Oc sporozoites, coronin overexpression is compensating for its reduced binding ability to a mutated actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further probe the domain contributions to this rescue, we tested whether mutations to coronin would improve motility and invasion of the PbS4Oc parasite line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations in the N-terminal actin binding domain (coronin mutant R349E, K350E), as expected, could not rescue the PbS4Oc phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested if the actin binding N-terminal domain of coronin (residues 1388, lacking the unique region and coiled-coil domain), which was shown to bind and bundle actin [40], affected motility and invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also could not improve the invasion and motility of the PbS4Oc parasite, suggesting a cooperative involvement of both N- and C-terminal regions of coronin in mediating rescue (Fig 4C4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Exchanging_subdomain_3_allows_for_improved_incorporation_into_parasite_filaments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Above, we identified subdomains 2 and 3 as key contributors to essential processes in blood stage parasites (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to assess the contribution of these regions to altered actin dynamics, we performed a second screen by expressing these variants (PbS2Oc, OcS2Pb [residues 3471], PbS3bOc, and OcS3bPb [residues 264338]) as mCherry-tagged additional copies under the control of a sporozoite stage-specific promoter (Fig 5A, S8 Fig and S9 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allowed for careful phenotypic characterisation in the parasite without the lethality observed in the initial screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tagged actins revealed interesting differences: an additional copy of parasite actin was present throughout the parasite cell, as expected [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, mammalian actin was only cytoplasmic with a notable absence in the nuclear region (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the two control parasite lines (expressing either parasite or canonical actin) differed in their response to jasplakinolide: parasite mCherry-actin accumulated at both the front and rear of the cell (Fig 5B), sites implicated for F-actin formation (in the case of formin 1, which is located at the front; S8 Fig) and turnover (rear) [37,40,41,42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mammalian mCherry-actin displayed no change in localisation (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that tagged mammalian actin is not readily incorporated into jasplakinolide-stabilised parasite F-actin in the sporozoite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next assessed localisation and jasplakinolide responsiveness with the actin chimeras.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly [22], the chimeras containing exchanges in subdomain 2 (a highly flexible and divergent region between species) were similar in behaviour to their corresponding controls (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, exchanging subdomain 3 resulted in reciprocal effects: a mammalian actin containing this corresponding parasite region (residues 264338 with 21 changes; 72% sequence identity) resulted in a changed localisation under jasplakinolide, thus suggesting more efficient incorporation to endogenous filaments (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changing the same region in the parasite actin resulted in a cellular distribution and jasplakinolide response similar to mammalian actin, suggesting that subdomain 3 contains the contacts necessary and sufficient for incorporation into divergent filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the effect appears to be independent of the H-plug, as changing the two divergent amino acid residues on the loop and the two most divergent residues outside this loop back to residues in the canonical actin (K270M, A272S, E308P, and T315Q) still rendered an additional copy of actin that behaved similarly to Plasmodium actin (Fig 5D) [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parasites expressing rabbit actin displayed a 50% reduction in parasite average speed (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, all chimeras of Plasmodium actin consistently moved with a slightly higher average speed compared to their corresponding mammalian chimeras.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OcS3bPb, the only mammalian actin chimera that responded to jasplakinolide treatment, moved at a similar speed to the wild-type Plasmodium actin control (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Actin_subdomains_2_and_3_contribute_to_efficient_parasite_monomer_incorporation_in_highly_divergent_cell_systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the specific regions that we identified above are common contributors to actin dynamics in other cell types, we performed a third screen by transfecting the panel of chimeras into different mammalian cells as additional copies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher eukaryotic cells did not readily incorporate parasite actin into stable filamentous structures (Fig 6A and 6B, S10 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, cells containing parasite actin moved slightly faster in a random migration assay (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicate that malaria parasite actin can be used as a template to identify the minimum determinants required for filament incorporation in higher eukaryotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, changing subdomain 2 or 3 into the corresponding mammalian equivalent resulted in the parasite GFP-actin more readily incorporating into filament networks (Fig 6A and 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, exchanging individual regions of mammalian actin did not result in decreased incorporation, suggesting that more than one region can provide the required minimal contacts necessary for incorporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify key amino acid residues contributing to filament incorporation, multiple mutations (whereby parasite actin residues were converted to conserved mammalian counterparts) in both subdomain 2 and subdomain 3 were generated and analysed (Fig 6A and 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the results of the parasite lines, single and multiple mutations of both the H-plug and regions typically on the surface of the actin filament in subdomain 3 did not result in improved filament incorporation, suggesting an extensive interface in the subdomain 3 region required for incorporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, a single residue change (N41H) in subdomain 2 of Plasmodium actin was sufficient to rescue filament incorporation (Fig 6A and 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the presence of an imidazole group alone provides sufficient interaction for more efficient filament incorporation (Fig 6A and 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, crucial differences between actin species, including the ability for a monomer to incorporate into divergent filaments, are due to the changes in particular divergent regions in specific subdomains only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, subdomain 3 is the key common contributor to filament incorporation in two very diverse cellular systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differential_functional_requirements_of_Plasmodium_and_mammalian_actin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While, structurally, the Plasmodium actin 1 monomer is similar to that of canonical mammalian actins [22], Plasmodium actin filaments are shorter and more dynamic [22,26,27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have shown that Plasmodium actin is unable to efficiently incorporate into actin filaments of mammalian cells and that tagged mammalian and Plasmodium actin localise differently in parasites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using MD simulations as well as chimeric and mutagenesis genetic screens, we identified the fundamental contributors that underlie these different characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data independently confirm that these two actins occupy a similar structural space and identify divergent amino acid residues responsible for the differences in filament dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmodium was unable to tolerate allelic changes in subdomains 2 and 3, suggesting that these regions have crucial features required for parasite biology and are, particularly P42 and the H-plug, key contributors to contact sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data suggest that modifications of these two regions result in filaments that are too stable and thus lethal for the parasite, similar to the effects observed with jasplakinolide treatment or genetic ablation of the actin regulator, ADF1, and the alpha capping protein [31,32,43,44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Strong_selection_pressure_on_parasite_actin_in_the_mosquito  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike exchanges in subdomains 2 and 3, the parasite readily tolerated the exchange of highly divergent regions of subdomain 4 and the N-terminal residues (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parasite lines grew like wild-type parasites in the blood stage and were only affected in their progression in the mosquito host (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this indicates that red blood cell invasion, while dependent on actin [33], is more tolerant of minor changes to its sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with ablating ABP expression having little effect on the parasite in the mammalian host but having a strong effect once the parasite infects the insect vector [37,4448].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While other studies looked indirectly with actin regulators, our study investigated the core of the machinery itself across the life cycle, revealing that modest changes to dynamics have important consequences in mosquito colonisation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the greatest selection pressure on the parasite actin sequence could be during active organ penetration of the mosquito.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Changes to the N-terminal sequence resulted in a consistent decrease in speed between the two parasite stages that employ gliding motility in the mosquito (Fig 3B and 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the well-known interaction between the actin N-terminus and myosin [4956], it is reasonable to suggest that the decrease in cell speed is due to a reduced interaction between these two proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus propose that parasites containing this change in acidic residue content have reduced force transmission of actomyosin, which results in reduced average speeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis could be probed in vitro using classical myosin sliding filament assays with the respective Plasmodium machinery components [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies in yeast have indicated a relatively low threshold in opisthokonts to accommodate changes to its actin subdomain 1 sequence, in which the addition of a single acidic residue to the N-terminus rendered viable yet sick yeast cells, while two additional acidic residues were lethal for the cell [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the addition of another acidic residue to parasite actin was surprisingly well tolerated (Figs 2 and 3): these parasites could complete the life cycle and move sufficiently well to cause infection (albeit at a lower overall efficiency in the mosquito).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, yeast cells with changes to subdomain 1 and the N-terminus were sensitive to changes in growth temperature [5861].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the marked differences in body temperatures between mosquito and mammal, it is possible that changes in parasite actin sequence affect the well-tuned actin dynamics required at different temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro polymerisation assays with these mutants at both 37°C and 21°C would provide important insights into differences in the polymerisation kinetics at different temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These detailed kinetic studies are especially interesting given that hybrid actins between rabbit muscle and yeast equivalents can produce unexpected changes to certain biochemical properties [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rapid_filament_recycling_and_continuous_parasite_movement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, modifications of three amino acid residues in subdomain 4 rendered a parasite that frequently paused and reversed direction during migration (Fig 3H3J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that this change in motility is due to more stable actin filaments, which might be misoriented and hence allow partial rearward motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar movements can be observed if Toxoplasma parasites are treated with high concentrations of jasplakinolide, a filament-stabilising drug [62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed previously that coronin can bind to actin filaments in motile sporozoites but not to those treated with jasplakinolide [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, in the PbS4Oc sporozoites, coronin did not bind actin filaments and hence this parasite to some extent phenocopies jasplakinolide treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parasites could also not enter salivary glands efficiently, for which well- tuned actin dynamics are important [37,45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, overexpression of coronin rescued both motility and invasion phenotypes (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates a central role for coronin in rapid filament recycling in the highly motile parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the discontinuous movements in subdomain 4 mutants (PbS4Oc and HGE/TSA) result from reduced actin filament recycling due to altered architecture and interactions at the filament interface, particularly by enhanced interactions of F54 and Y189.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By alteration of subdomain 4 residues, the resulting contacts by conserved amino acid residues render the parasite actin filament less prone to disassembly as choreographed by coronin (S11 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reduced invasion and aberrant motility were only rescued by full-length coronin, while mutated or truncated coronins were insufficient to rescue these phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may suggest a cooperative requirement of the coronin domains for actin turnover (Fig 4C4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was somewhat surprising, because a recent publication on the biochemical properties of P. falciparum coronin suggested that much of the classical coronin function could be carried out by the N-terminal actin binding domain alone [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work indicates that, in the context of the P. berghei actin mutated sporozoite, both regions of coronin are required for full functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism by which coronin could be mediating Plasmodium filament recycling could be similar to that in higher eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these, coronin mediates a spatial-temporal recruitment of other filament regulators [6365].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coronin binds first and, depending on the nucleotide state of the actin [63,66], can serve to shield or allow access of ADFs to the filament.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of these additional factors together results in destabilisation of the filament.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the close proximity of coronin and ADF on canonical filaments, it was also suggested that coronin could interact directly with ADF in the filament [6467].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that the rescue mediated by coronin could be due to a stepwise recruitment by coronin, with depolymerisation factors on the highly dynamic Plasmodium actin filament, which thus enhances severing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our rescue experiments thus hint at a possibly conserved spatial-temporal coronin mechanism for filament regulation beyond what has currently been demonstrated for opisthokonts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The C-terminal region of coronin appears important for this rescue, which suggests that this domain could allow for an interaction with other ABPs [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it has been suggested for coronin of the related parasite T. gondii that the C-terminal coiled-coil domain could function as a molecular recruitment hub [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the C-terminal region simply provides an improved interaction with the filament, resulting in efficient turnover in the parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our observations suggest interplay between both halves of Plasmodium coronin to mediate efficient rescue in motile sporozoites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_vivo_screens_reveal_actin_dynamics_dependent_on_typically_non-interfacial_residues  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A recent high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the jasplakinolide-stabilised Plasmodium actin filament [16] is in good agreement with our models and generally fits with our biological observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some of our in vivo observations could not be directly inferred from the static structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the combined mutation of H195 and G200 (to Thr and Ser, respectively) at a lateral interface in Plasmodium actin had no significant effect on the parasite across the entire complex life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third residue, E232, which is not at an interface, with the exception of one published structure [70], needed to be mutated in order for an effect on parasite biology to be observed, suggesting a dynamic interplay across several residues in this region (Fig 3C3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that E232 could provide a compensatory interaction when H195 and G200 are mutated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our systematic approach, which spans from molecular models to cells, has thus identified novel cooperative interactions within actin filaments (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Parasite_actin_provides_molecular_insights_into_monomer-to-filament_incorporation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we made use of additional copy expression systems in highly divergent cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that these assays can only provide insights into monomer incorporation into filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we can make no direct inferences regarding whether each actin mutant, if present as the primary untagged actin in the cell, can fully complement wild-type function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, PbS2Oc was lethal as a replacement yet behaved similarly to wild-type Plasmodium actin as an additional copy in the parasite (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Newly available genetic tools, such as inducible knockout systems [33], might be adapted to probe these otherwise lethal mutants for their functional consequences in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our observation that parasite actin does not efficiently incorporate into the mammalian cell actin network provided a useful tool in understanding the minimal requirements for network incorporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, subdomain 4 conversion of parasite actin did not improve network incorporation efficiency, while changing subdomain 2 or 3 resulted in a considerable incorporation into filamentous structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subdomain 2, with its highly dynamic extendibility, has been implicated to act as the primary interaction arm, after initial contact by subdomain 4, to allow the incoming monomer to bind to the barbed end [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N41H mutant in Plasmodium actin subdomain 2 alone shows improved incorporation into mammalian actin filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histidine has the capacity to have more contacts than asparagine and thus this position might be the key prominent interaction to allow optimal contact with the filament [16] (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, oxidation of H40 results in an actin monomer that is unable to polymerise [71,72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we extend this understanding to include this contact as important for an incoming monomer to dock onto a filament.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, with others, have shown that subdomain 3 provides important contact sites across the strand once the monomer has been incorporated and also for the incoming monomer to be included in the filament [15,36,73] (Fig 1 and Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we cannot exclude that subdomain 3 could be providing the required contact interface to allow for increased ABP-mediated incorporation [74].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that having at least one of these important subdomain sites (2 or 3b) is sufficient for effective incorporation in higher eukaryotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of altered ABP binding between actin species could shed light on the primary factors responsible for monomer incorporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, there is a consistent feature between divergent systems: alteration of subdomain 3 allowed for a mammalian equivalent to be more efficiently incorporated into the highly divergent parasite cytoskeleton, indicating that this region could be a common site of recognition across differently behaving actin species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be tested with other highly divergent actins to assess whether this region acts as a common recognition point across species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Through our comparative approaches, we have identified essential contributors to the differential behaviour of two highly divergent actin species (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have identified a region of subdomain 3 outside the H-plug as providing important contacts to allow an otherwise divergent actin to be more efficiently incorporated into canonical actin filaments, thus enhancing our molecular understanding of the dynamic space required for filament incorporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that a deeper understanding of Plasmodium actin dynamics sheds light on the fundamental properties of the actin polymer across eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such findings provide insights into the structural space required for actin subunits to assemble in order to meet the diverse needs for filament dynamics of different cells, ranging from protozoan parasites through to classical mammalian systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Rapid motility relies on highly dynamic turnover of actin filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the wild-type parasite, transient and short filaments (dark blue, small arrowhead) are built from monomers (light blue) at the parasite tip and are translocated to the rear by myosin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This retrograde flow results in a rearward direction of force, ultimately propelling the organism forward as it attaches on a substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the rear, the filaments need to be rapidly disassembled (large arrowhead).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This efficient turnover allows for relatively consistent sporozoite movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jasplakinolide treatment results in a collection of presumably longer filaments (small arrowhead) primarily at the front and rear of the parasite (large arrowheads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased stability leads to reduced filament recycling and thus the parasite stops moving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations in actin subdomain 4 result in longer and more stable filaments, as in the wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the parasite rear, a reduced rate of disassembly might cause a delay in filament recycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shift in equilibrium might cause a pause in motility until sufficient restoration allows the parasite to generate the required filament flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filament orientation is kept simple in this cartoon but might also change and lead to the observed rearward motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Rows for the mutated residues are coloured consistently with Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis was done on multiple sequence alignment of all homologs searched in UNIREF90 database with sequence identity of  greater than 35% (Total 150 Proteins).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was observed that the interfaces are more divergent, with average conservation score of 0.42 and 0.31 for Rabbit and P. berghei actin, respectively (http://consurf.tau.ac.il/2016/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
