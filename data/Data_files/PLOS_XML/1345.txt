Magmatic evolution of Panama Canal volcanic rocks: A record of arc processes and tectonic change  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Volcanic rocks along the Panama Canal present a world-class opportunity to examine the relationship between arc magmatism, tectonic forcing, wet and dry magmas, and volcanic structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major and trace element geochemistry of Canal volcanic rocks indicate a significant petrologic transition at 2125 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oligocene Bas Obispo Fm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rocks have large negative Nb-Ta anomalies, low HREE, fluid mobile element enrichments, a THI of 0.88, and a H2Ocalc of  greater than 3 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  %.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the Miocene Pedro Miguel and Late Basalt Fm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  exhibit reduced Nb-Ta anomalies, flattened REE curves, depleted fluid mobile elements, a THI of 1.45, a H2Ocalc of less_than1 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  %, and plot in mid-ocean ridge/back-arc basin fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geochemical modeling of Miocene rocks indicates 0.50.1 kbar crystallization depths of hot (11001190°C) magmas in which most compositional diversity can be explained by fractional crystallization (F = 0.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the most silicic lavas (Las Cascadas Fm.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  require an additional mechanism, and assimilation-fractional-crystallization can reproduce observed compositions at reasonable melt fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Canal volcanic rocks, therefore, change from hydrous basaltic pyroclastic deposits typical of mantle-wedge-derived magmas, to hot, dry bi-modal magmatism at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest the primary reason for the change is onset of arc perpendicular extension localized to central Panama.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution mapping along the Panama Canal has revealed a sequence of inward dipping maar-diatreme pyroclastic pipes, large basaltic sills, and bedded silicic ignimbrites and tuff deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These volcanic bodies intrude into the sedimentary Canal Basin and are cut by normal and subsequently strike-slip faults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such pyroclastic pipes and basaltic sills are most common in extensional arc and large igneous province environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the change in volcanic edifice form and geochemistry are related to onset of arc perpendicular extension, and are consistent with the idea that Panama arc crust fractured during collision with South America forming the observed Canal extensional zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Volcanic arcs are one of the primary loci of magmatic evolution on Earth, and play a critical role in the compositional development of continental crust (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, arcs and subduction zones are complex geochemical systems that integrate magmatic and fluid components from the mantle, crust and subducting slab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Determining the relative importance of each of these inputs is often ambiguous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a general consensus exists that most arc magmatism results from the dehydration of hydrous minerals (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  amphibole, chlorite, antigorite, phlogopite [6, 7] within the subducting slab at depths between 75170 km [8, 9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluids from the slab flux the overlying mantle wedge and induce partial melting leading to the production of large ion lithophile (LILE) enriched and high-field strength element (HFSE) depleted basaltic magmas [10, 7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such hydrous magmas then ascend, pond in the mid-crust to form plutons, and erupt on the surface to form arc volcanoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This view of arc magmatism can explain much of the generalized geochemical characteristics we observe in arc volcanic and plutonic rocks, however it is essentially a static view how arcs operate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reality, almost all arcs exhibit significant temporal and spatial variability, and understanding what causes such variability is an important frontier in the comprehension of arc physical and chemical processes [11, 12, 13, 14, 15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our general strategy for understanding this problem is to examine arcs that have complex, but understandable histories and to examine how they evolve over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this contribution, we focus on evolution of the Panama magmatic arc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examine the geochemical and tectonic changes that occurred at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary that Farris et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16] correlates with the onset of collision between the Panama Block and South America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key aspect of the Panama arc is that it has a distinct beginning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It initiated at 7375 Ma atop the trailing edge of the Caribbean plate [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This initiation point provides a limit on potential complexities particularly in comparison to Cordilleran arcs in both North and South America that have magmatic histories extending back hundreds of millions of years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it also lies at what is now the intersection of five plates and crustal blocks and so there are multiple potential events that have occurred during its evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wörner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [18], Wegner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [19] and Farris et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16] divide Panama arc activity into an initial depleted arc and an enriched Miocene arc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wörner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [18] and Wegner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [19] grouped the Canal volcanic rocks into the enriched Miocene arc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whattam et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [20], has also proposed the existence of an adakite-like group of 2530 Ma volcanic rocks immediately to the west and east of the Canal region that may have formed via a slab tear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Farris et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16] showed that the Miocene Canal rocks form a unique group that are depleted in fluid mobile elements and have extensional characteristics that result from fracturing of the Isthmus of Panama lithosphere during initial collision with South America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The end of the Miocene arc in Panama is not well defined, although modern magmatism exists only west of the Canal region and is characterized by adakite-like magmatism in rocks younger than 23 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Panama adakites have been variously ascribed to slab-melting [21, 22, 23, 20], a slab-window [24], subduction erosion [25], multiple stage fraction processes [26], or oblique subduction [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our goal is to present a high-resolution picture of the petrologic, volcanologic and structural evolution of the rocks along the Panama Canal and to determine how onset of the Panama block-South America collision influences arc processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Geologic_units__stratigraphy_and_structural_mapping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rocks along the Panama Canal have been described and mapped periodically over 100 years since its construction (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geologic surveys were conducted during the initial excavation of the Culebra Cut in the early part of the 20th century (e.g.[28]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional geologic mapping was undertaken in the late 1960s during a previous canal expansion [29] and further regional geologic mapping was conducted by Stewart and Stewart [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these earlier efforts had particular geologic or engineering goals on which they focused.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the earliest mapping efforts were focused on determining rock type variation in furtherance of Canal construction, whereas Lutton and Banks [29] focused on understanding periodic landslides along the Canal cuts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much of the recent geologic fieldwork along the Canal has focused on stratigraphy of the sedimentary sections and often has had a paleontologic emphasis (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [31, 32, 33]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The goal of mapping presented here is to improve the understanding of the volcanic stratigraphy and structural geometry along the Panama Canal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 presents a stratigraphic section from a volcanic perspective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, most previous Canal region stratigraphic work has focused almost exclusively on the sedimentary rocks, which make up less_than25% of the stratigraphic column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figs 38 present field and photomicrographs of the various volcanic units, and Figs 913 present geologic maps and cross-sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This research takes advantage of significant new exposures created by the 20082016 Canal expansion, and permission for the fieldwork was granted by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Geochemical data presented in this paper are derived from instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), x-ray florescence spectrometry (XRF), and scanning electronic microscope energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS) (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the trace element data except Nb and Zr are from the INAA technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nb and Zr were determined using XRF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presented major element data are also derived from INAA, except for SiO2 and P2O5, which were determined by low-vacuum SEM-EDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  INAA was conducted at the University of Missouri Research Reactor, whereas the XRF and SEM-EDS analyses were conducted at the Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute in Washington D.C..  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEM-EDS analyses were compared to USGS standards AGV-1 and DNC-1, and for example, SiO2 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % had an accuracy of ± 1.45 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % and a precision of 0.45 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  %.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several samples, using the same powders, were re-analyzed via whole rock XRF techniques at the University of Florida and commercially at ALS-Chemex, using a lithium metaborate flux to create glass disks, and yielded concentrations within the stated accuracy (Fig 14A and 14B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference between the reanalyzed XRF samples and the INAA + SEM-EDS analyses was for most elements less than 5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, duplicate analyses at different laboratories and by analytical techniques yielded very similar elemental concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All analytical techniques were conducted on powdered whole rock samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce contamination powdering was done using an agate mill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, care was taken to sample the freshest available rocks in the field, and only samples that contained unaltered igneous textures in thin-section were chosen for geochemical analysis (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figs 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The totals presented are anhydrous and do not include LOI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See supporting online material in Farris et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16] for a more compete description of the analytical methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, for select samples, the INAA trace element data was compared via re-analysis to ICP-MS measurements also using the same powders (Fig 14C14F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The re-analysis was done using an ELEMENT 2 at the University of Florida.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For most trace elements, both INAA and ICP-MS analyses yielded similar concentrations and have elemental values within 5% of each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the Pedro Miguel Formation Cs and Rb measurements were systematically high in the INAA data set, as actual concentrations appear to be below the limit of analytical precision (Fig 14C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nb and Zr measurements were also somewhat higher in the INAA / XRF dataset as compared to ICP-MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for most elements, the ICP-MS and INAA data sets plot in overlapping field and agree with one another down to sub-ppm levels of precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be clearly observed in plots of Ba vs La (Fig 14E) and Ta vs Yb (Fig 14F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These elements were chosen as examples because they illustrate some of the key geochemical differences between Oligocene (Bas Obispo Fm.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Miocene (Pedro Miguel Fm.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note the Ba enrichment and Ta depletion in the Bas Obispo Fm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rocks relative to the Pedro Miguel Fm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the dominant trace element patterns are very similar in both the INAA and ICP-MS data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemistry and figures presented below use the INAA/XRF/SEM-EDS dataset as only they cover all units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Major_element_chemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Major element chemistry of Canal volcanic rocks range from basalt to dacite in composition and from 47 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % to 70 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % SiO2 (Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum observed MgO is approximately 6 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  %, and this is found in the Pedro Miguel Formation lava flows (Fig 15A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the Pedro Miguel Formation and the Late Basalt, each progressively younger unit exhibits a progressively lower slope MgO and SiO2 trend with the Pedro Miguel lava flows being the steepest and the Late Basalt having the lowest slope trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One exception are Pedro Miguel silicic tuff units which plot at the head of the Late Basalt trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rocks are also the most silicic within the Pedro Miguel and Late Basalt units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most silicic units along the Panama Canal are the Panama City and Las Cascadas Formations, which plot together and range from 5770 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % SiO2 and have values of less_than 2 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % MgO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, Panama Canal volcanic rocks are tholeiitic and even the most silicic rocks are tholeiitic in terms of their FeO*/MgO ratio (Fig 15 C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another characteristic of tholeiitic rocks is a strong Fe and Ti enrichment due to the early crystallization of plagioclase [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a trend is observed within the Late Basalt and to a lesser degree in the Pedro Miguel Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of FeO* (all Fe as FeO), the Late Basalt Formation increases from 9 to 11 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % with increasing SiO2 (Fig 15B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of TiO2, the Late Basalt Formation increases from 1 to almost 2 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % with increasing SiO2 exhibiting an even stronger enrichment trend (Fig 14D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both Fe and Ti, the silicic Pedro Miguel tuffs connect the enriched Late Basalt rocks in a trend continuous with the more silicic Panama City Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the Bas Obispo Formation does not exhibit similar Fe and Ti enrichment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Canal volcanic rocks also exhibit distinctive trends in terms of the alkali elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of Canal volcanic rocks are low to medium K (Fig 15E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the Las Cascadas and Panama City Formation rocks plot in the medium to high K series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of Na2O several distinct series are present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At silica values between 4750% SiO2, Na2O decreases steeply from approximately 5 to 2 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  %.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At those silica values, Na2O is effective at discriminating the different Pedro Miguel pyroclastic units, with the black fragmented unit ploting with the lowest Na2O values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At SiO2 values greater than 50 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  %, Na2O increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly evident in the Late Basalt and the Panama City and Las Cascadas units which together form a continuous trend of increasing Na2O with increasing SiO2 with 6% Na2O reached at 70% SiO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CaO decreases continuously with SiO2 from approximately 12 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % CaO at 47 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % SiO2 to 0.5 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % CaO at 70 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % SiO2 (Fig 15G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trend is smooth with several exceptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tan Pedro Miguel pyroclastic unit extends to lower CaO values, and the Las Cascadas / Panama City group does as well, although at higher SiO2 values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the Canal volcanic rocks have in general low K2O values, relatively high Na2O and average CaO concentrations for arc volcanic rocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Trace_element_chemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Geochemical_models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better interpret the petrologic evolution of the above Canal volcanic rocks, major and trace element geochemical models have been constructed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The models indicate that shallow level fractional crystallization can explain most of the compositional variation within the Pedro Miguel and Late Basalt Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, fractional crystallization alone does not well describe geochemical variation between the Oligocene Bas Obispo and the various Miocene units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the Miocene rocks, pure fractional crystallization models have difficulty replicating the most silicic units (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the Las Cascadas Formation) at reasonable melt fractions, however assimilation fractional crystallization models are more successful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below the details of the major and trace element models are discussed in depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, this paper has three main goals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are: 1) To produce a quantitative petrologic model of the Canal region volcanic rocks, 2) To interpret the observed volcanic and tectonic structures in the area, and 3) to determine how goals 1 and 2 are inter-related and influenced by larger-scale tectonic changes in the Panama arc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Petrologic_model_of_the_Panama_Canal_volcanic_rocks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The largest petro-tectonic distinction within the Canal volcanic rocks occurs at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary with Bas Obispo Formation and older arc rocks being dominated by amphibole fractionation processes that occur at mid-crustal depths [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Miocene Canal volcanic rocks of diverse major element compositions share a common depletion in hydrous fluids and fluid mobile elements and have a reduced subduction signature with a significantly lessened negative Ta anomaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Miocene basaltic and silicic end members also plot in extensional fields on tectonic discrimination diagrams (Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full range of Pedro Miguel and Late Basalt Formation rocks can be reproduced in trace and major element models via pure fractional crystallization that occurs at very shallow (0.50.1 kbar) pressures (Figs 19 and 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within individual Pedro Miguel volcanic edifices basaltic and andesitic rocks alternate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that multiple episodes of magma recharge and eruption occurred within each body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each eruptive sequence more silicic rocks occur first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the underlying magma chamber was underwent continuous fractionation, but was only periodically tapped during eruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During each eruptive sequence, the top and therefore the most silicic portion of the magma chamber erupted first, followed by less evolved lavas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a mechanism would reproduce the observed volcanic stratigraphy within the Pedro Miguel Formation, and matches in detail what is observed at Hodges Hill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most silicic Miocene units include the Las Cascadas and Panama City Formations, and the trace element signature of these rocks cannot be reproduced using pure fractional crystallization models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However as indicated above, assimilation fractional crystallization models do successfully reproduce Las Cascadas and Panama City Formation rocks at reasonable melt fractions (Fig 20C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we suggest that assimilation fractional crystallization (AFC) processes are responsible for the creation of the most silicic Canal volcanic rocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The geochemical models discussed above do a good job of explaining petrologic variability within the Miocene Canal volcanic rocks, but the do not really address the question of why they are different (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hotter dryer melts with shallower fractionation depths) from those in the Oligocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rooney et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [34] proposed arcs produce melts with both wet and dry fractionation trends and that the Las Cascadas Formation is simply part of the dry fractionation melt series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rooney et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [34] also suggested that the Las Cascadas Formation rocks were more silicic because they were part of the dry trend, but they did not examine basaltic Miocene rocks such as the Pedro Miguel Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Zimmer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [48] described a relationship between calc-alkaline and tholeiitic rock series and the amount of water the magmas contain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They analyzed this relationship by calculating a tholeiitic index (THI) and then quantifying how the tholeiitic index varies with respect to the amount of independently measured water in a melt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  THI is the ratio of FeO* wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % at MgO values of 4.0 and 8.0 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  %, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following formulas allow the amount of water in a melt to be calculated from major element data:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(1)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(2)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Applied to the Canal volcanic rocks these yield a THI = 1.45 and H2Ocalc wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % = 0.55 for the Late Basalt Formation and values of THI = 0.88 and H2Ocalc wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % = 3.31 for the Bas Obispo Formation (Fig 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pedro Miguel Formation rocks lie between the above units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the calculated H2Ocalc wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  % values are consistent with the idea of a shift to dryer more tholeiitic magmatism in the Miocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, Zimmer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [48] present a list of THI index values and water contents for various volcanic systems around the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bas Obispo Formation values are consistent with those derived from subduction settings including those from: Alaska, Central America, the Cascades and Japan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, THI indices similar to the Late Basalt Formation (1.45) are only found in back-arc basin, mid-ocean ridge and ocean island settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, THI indices from back-arc basins are most similar and include those from: the Mariana Trough, the Lau, Woodlark and North Fiji Basins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are several observations that suggest the change from wet to dry arc magmatism was not part of normal evolution in arc magmatism, but instead was forced into this mode by specific tectonic events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First is the change observed using tectonic discrimination diagrams in which both basaltic and silicic Miocene rocks plot in extensional fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the Miocene volcanic rocks have a decreased subduction signature (smaller Ta anomaly) compared to adjacent Oligocene rocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, structural mapping shows abundant normal faulting and shows that the Canal itself sits within a structural graben that likely provided accommodation space for the volcano-sedimentary units of the Canal Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively these observations suggest the onset of an extensional event at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this interpretation, extension thinned the crust and caused upwelling in the underlying asthenosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continued decompression melting of the asthenosphere and magma ascent to very shallow levels, caused the resulting melts to dry out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a model would account for what is observed in the Canal region and what is required by geochemical models presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Magmatism sourced in the Canal region ends earlier than volcanic activity outside the region (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  El Valle, [22]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The youngest unit we observe along the Canal is the Late Basalt Formation, and while not dated, it is in stratigraphic continuity with the Pedro Miguel Formation and so has a similar if somewhat younger age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conservatively, it can be stated that the Late Basalt Formation is older than 15 Ma, and since this time there has been no active magmatism along the Panama Canal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Younger Canal rocks such as the Gatun Formation on the Caribbean coast contain ash layers [27], but these are sourced elsewhere (most likely El Valle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We postulate that the same petrologic mechanism that led to the distinct extensional geochemical signatures of the Miocene Canal volcanic rocks also led to the early cessation of magmatism in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our preferred petrologic mechanism for Canal volcanism is decompression melting of the sub-arc mantle due to lithospheric extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial melting of the sub-arc mantle can only occur for so long without fluid replenishment due to sub-arc mantle corner flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the extension and fracturing of the Isthmus [16] inhibited corner flow, then the sub-arc mantle beneath the Canal region would eventually become infertile and restitic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a result is consistent with the observation that Canal magmatism ends by approximately 15 Ma, but continues in other parts of the Panama arc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interpretation_of_mapped_volcanic_structures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, detailed geologic mapping along the Panama Canal has defined a sequence of large basaltic sills (Late Basalt Fm.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and inward dipping pyroclastic edifices (Pedro Miguel Fm.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inward dipping structures are interpreted as volcanic maars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In volcanic arcs such modes of volcanic intrusion and extrusion are not common, but have been described in extensional settings such as the Auckland volcanic field in New Zealand [49, 50, 51].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volcanic arcs typically produce plutonic intrusions of gabbro to granodiorite overlain by outward dipping composite volcanoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, sill and maar intrusive and extrusive forms are most common in large igneous provinces such as the Karoo of South Africa, the Ferrar Supergroup in Antarctica, and the Siberian Traps [52, 53, 54, 55, 56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is our interpretation that the volcanic forms observed along the Panama Canal formed are due to the physical properties of the intruding magmas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, that the observed change from hydrous arc magmas in the Oligocene to dry, hot extensional magmatism in the Miocene also corresponded to a change in the type of constructed magmatic structures (Fig 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lorenz [57] and Lorenz and Kurszlaukis [58] define maar-diatreme volcanism as forming from an explosive eruption that creates a pipe-like crater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surrounding the crater, if preserved, will be a tephra ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interior of the pipe is subsequently filled with additional inward dipping tephra and pyroclastic deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any remaining accommodation space at the top of the crater can be subsequently filled with post eruptive sediments or additional near horizontal volcanic deposits if volcanism remains active in the nearby area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a volcanic stratigraphy matches quite well what is observed in the Pedro Miguel Formation, particularly at Hodges Hill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maar-diatreme volcanism is often interpreted to result from phreatomagmatic processes [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if an underlying feeder dike or sill encounters significant near surface ground water, explosive volcanism can result creating the observed volcanic pipe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple to hundreds of individual explosions can occur to excavate the initial pipe, depending on exactly how ground water interacts with the magmatic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lorenz and Kurszlaukis [58] suggest that the explosive eruptions progressively excavate the pipe downwards and that within the root zone a breccia of shatter host rocks and eruptive magmas develops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Panama Canal examples presented here, roots of the maar complexes are not exposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the middle eruptive sequences at Hodges Hill contain tephra deposits composed of fragments of underlying welded pyroclastic rocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that multiple explosive eruptions were required to build the observed structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Sub-volcanic and shallow level intrusive structures have also been studied in volcanic arcs, and we will now compare our observations along the Canal to an example of hydrous magmatism from the Sierra Nevada batholith in California.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sisson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [59] examined the 92 Ma gabbroic Onion Valley Sill complex and observed a sequence of over 300 m of hornblende gabbro and diorite sills that overlie an approximately 200 m thick cummulate body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emplacement depth is estimated at between 12 kbar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is deeper than the Canal basaltic sills, but is still a useful point of comparison for dry vs wet arc magmatism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sisson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [59] state that the Onion Valley sills were emplaced at volatile saturation due to the presence of miarolitic cavities and estimate total dissolved water content at near 6 wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  %.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This amount of water is much greater than was present in the Miocene Canal volcanic magmas, and approximately twice the calculated value for the Oligocene Bas Obispo Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sisson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [59] also state that the high water content of the Onion Valley basaltic magmas significantly influenced their physical properties and in particular lowered the liquidus temperature and melt density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated liquidus temperature of the Onion Valley magmas is approximately 1000°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, MELTS modeling of the Pedro Miguel Formation suggests a liquidus temperature of between 11001190°C for crystallization pressures of 1.00.1 kbar, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the MELTS results agree with other temperature estimates for dry basaltic arc magmas (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1100°C, [60]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the dry and shallow nature of the Pedro Miguel and Late Basalt Formations cause them to be 100200°C hotter than older (Oligocene) hydrous arc melts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This likely played a significant role in the types of volcanic structures formed in that the hotter dryer melts led to more explosive ground water interactions and caused maar and sill structures to be dominant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tectonic_and_structural_implications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, structural mapping and geochemical data indicate that Canal arc magmatism transitions from hydrous mantle-wedge derived volcanism to magmatism dominated by extensional characteristics at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary (Fig 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural maps and cross-sections clearly show the existence of normal faults and that the Panama Canal itself exists in a small structural graben.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest normal faults are Canal parallel / Isthmus perpendicular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the orientation of faults predicted in the Canal extensional zone of Farris et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16], however there are both Canal parallel and Canal perpendicular normal faults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Barat et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [61] also produced a tectonic model that shows extension within the Canal region, but they indicate extension occurs as the result of step overs on a series of approximately N-S strike-slip faults, and that normal faults should be dominantly E-W. As mentioned above, the largest normal faults are roughly Canal parallel, or perpendicular to the orientation predicted in the Barat et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [61] model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One explanation for observed normal fault orientations is as the Canal extensional zone opened due to fracturing and oroclinal rotation of the Isthmus during collision with South America [16], the extended crust, no longer attached to the coherent Panama block, collapsed northward towards the free surface of the Caribbean plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would produce dominantly E-W extension with a lesser component in the N-S direction, as observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transition to hot-dry extensional volcanism in the Miocene strongly suggests the occurrence of kilometer-scale crustal thinning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, normal faults mapped along the Canal itself, although numerous, are not large enough to accommodate lithospheric-scale extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gravity studies by Farris [62], Fowler [63] and Mynhier [64] suggest that larger detachment-scale normal faults exist and delineate a series of sub-basins within the Canal region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the mapping areas discussed in this paper represent small-scale intra-basin deformation, but the observed tectonic styles are representative of what exists on the scale of the entire Canal Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exhumation of basement massifs east of the Canal also yields information on the tectonic evolution of the Canal Basin itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-temperature thermochronology data presented in Farris et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16], Montes et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [33], and Ramírez et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [65] indicate that exhumation of arc basement massifs east of the Canal occurred contemporaneously with the onset of extensional magmatism at the beginning of the Miocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the Miocene, the Canal Basin itself must have undergone subsidence as it was accumulating sediments at this time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, (U-Th)/He apatite ages in the Cerro Azul and Rio Mamoni areas east of the Canal suggest exhumation between 1025 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these ages young westward toward the Canal region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One explanation is that arc basement rocks closest to the Canal basin are part of a Canal extensional zone rift flank and consequently experienced greater exhumation that continued until extension ceased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Normal faults in our Canal mapping areas are cut by younger pre-dominantly left-lateral strike-slip faults (Figs 1, 9 and 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an observation makes sense as modern tectonics of the Canal region are dominated by strike-slip faults such as the Rio Gatun and Pedro Miguel faults [66].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the extensional regime described in this paper ended at some point and was replaced by strike-slip tectonics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest strike strike-slip faults along the Canal are perpendicular to it and also at a high angle to the active Pedro Miguel fault (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pedro Miguel fault is right-lateral, whereas the Canal strike-slip faults are left-lateral suggesting they may be conjugates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rockwell et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [66] indicate slip-rates on the Pedro Miguel and Mira-Flores faults are on the order of 47 mm /yr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total displacement along the Pedro Miguel fault is no more than 510 km given offset units (Fig 1), and therefore must be younger than 13 million years old.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other age constraints on the onset of strike-slip tectonics and the end of extension come from the northern Canal region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young normal faults have been described in the Gatun and Chagres Formation (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [67]), and the depositional age of the youngest Chagres Formation rocks are approximately 5.8 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this suggests that extension in the Canal region persisted throughout the Miocene and ended between 5.8 and 3 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, extensional related magmatism as described in this paper likely ended by 15 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
