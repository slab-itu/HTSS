Genetic variants specific to aging-related verbal memory: Insights from GWASs in a population-based cohort  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Verbal memory is typically studied using immediate recall (IR) and delayed recall (DR) scores, although DR is dependent on IR capability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separating these components may be useful for deciphering the genetic variation in age-related memory abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was conducted to (a) construct individual trajectories in IR and independent aspects of delayed recall, or residualized-DR (rDR), across older adulthood; and (b) identify genetic markers that contribute to four estimated phenotypes: IR and rDR levels and changes after age 60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cognitively intact sample (N = 20,650 with 125,164 observations) was drawn from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative study of adults aged 50 and older.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mixed effects regression models were constructed using repeated measures from data collected every two years (19962012) to estimate level at age 60 and change in memory post-60 in IR and rDR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide association scans (GWAS) were conducted in the genotypic subsample (N = 7,486) using ~1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One SNP (rs2075650) in TOMM40 associated with rDR level at the genome-wide level (p = 5.0x10-08), an effect that replicated in an independent sample from the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing (N = 6,898 with 41,328 observations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meta-analysis of rDR level confirmed the association (p = 5.0x10-11) and identified two others in TOMM40 (rs71352238 p = 1.0x10-10; rs157582 p = 7.0x10-09), and one in APOE (rs769449 p = 3.1 x10-12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meta-analysis of IR change identified associations with three of the same SNPs in TOMM40 (rs157582 p = 8.3x10-10; rs71352238 p = 1.9x10-09) and APOE (rs769449 p = 2.2x10-08).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditional analyses indicate GWAS signals on rDR level were driven by APOE, whereas signals on IR change were driven by TOMM40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we found that TOMM40 had effects independent of APOE e4 on both phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings from this first U.S. population-based GWAS study conducted on both age-related immediate and delayed verbal memory merit continued examination in other samples and additional measures of verbal memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Memory impairment is the hallmark characteristic of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer disease (AD), and other types of dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is estimated that currently (in 2016), ~5.2 million, or 11.1% of the 47 million persons aged 65 or older in the United States will develop AD in their lifetimes [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an expanding population of older adults, these figures are expected to increase by 2050 to ~13.7 million, or 15.6% of the 87.7 million persons aged 65+ [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Verbal memory ability has particular relevance to aging research in that there is normative yet profound decline in older age [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular basis of such decline is increasingly being disentangled as is the intricate relationship between decline and memory-related deficits [510].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying the extent to which genetic variants underlie individual differences in specific aspects of memory trajectories are useful for understanding disease-related mechanisms that contribute to memory impairments as well as age-related memory changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Distinguishing_immediate_and_delayed_recall  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Verbal memory is one aspect of episodic memory that requires verbal processing for encoding or retrieval of words, sentences, or prose [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is typically assessed using both immediate recall and delayed recall tasks, which represent distinct cognitive processes [12, 13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediate recall involves use of working memory, by which recently-presented information is rehearsed until recollection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delayed recall requires intact immediate recall as it assesses retrieval of the information learned during the initial processing involved in immediate recall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conceptual distinction between immediate and delayed recall is supported by functional brain imaging studies suggesting different localization of these processes [1418].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, each component has distinct clinical relevance and implications when studying the underlying genetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies involving candidate genes have found learning and retrieval are partially distinct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a study of community-dwelling older adults (ages 59 to 95) evaluated change in cognitive performance, comparing individuals with the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e3/e3 and e3/e4 genotypes to assess the effect of the e4 risk allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With regard to verbal memory, e3/e4 individuals exhibited significantly greater decline in delayed recall but not immediate recall [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another study among healthy older adults (ages 60 to 100), the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme was evaluated for effects on prefrontal cognitive functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there were no associations found between COMT genotypes and verbal memory overall, upon testing differences in the association by gender, men who were homozygous for the Val allele (vs. Val/Met and Met/Met) performed better on delayed recall only [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no differences in either recall phase by genotype that were detected for women.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies provide preliminary indication that there is a distinct molecular basis for immediate and delayed recall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the clinical perspective, mild impairments in recall of verbal information over time are commonly experienced in aging and not considered pathological, whereas greater impairments particularly in delayed recall is a key early sign of Alzheimer disease and other dementias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delayed recall performance has been shown to be a better predictor than immediate recall of AD severity, conversion to AD in the dementia process, or in differentiating normative changes from MCI and AD [2123].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the clinical importance, decline in delayed recall independent of decline in immediate memory has not been well-characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, longitudinal studies report steady decline in overall verbal memory performance begins around 60 years of age [2, 2426].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinguishing patterns in decline for immediate and delayed verbal recall is critical because of the potential differences in age-related trajectories as well as differences in implications for disease identification and prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distinguishing_memory_level_and_change  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A related issue for studying trajectories of memory over age is whether the factors underlying level of memory performance in early life and midlife differ from the processes that produce memory decline in later life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To use an analogy from physical growth, it seems unlikely that the (behavioral and genetic) factors contributing to loss of height in later life are the same as those contributing to stature in early adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There has been increasing support of this age effect with episodic memory, and other cognitive aging phenotypes, as more studies have found that the effect of genes in older age (e.g., APOE, KIBRA, BDNF, DRD2, GRM3, COMT) tends to be stronger [2730].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, evidence from longitudinal studies of aging twins indicates that inter-individual variation in level is highly influenced by genetic factors, but the genetic factors contributing to memory level are partially distinct from those underlying memory decline [28, 3141].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these suggest that distinguishing between level and change in verbal memory abilities would be useful for detecting underlying genetic relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_aims  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study addresses three important limitations common in genetic research on memory decline in aging: (a) confounding of measurement of delayed memory with immediate memory and (b) reliance on candidate genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are unaware of any prior study that has used a genome-wide approach to identify unique genetic associations with immediate and delayed verbal recall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first aim of this study was to characterize trajectories of four discrete components of verbal memory across older adulthood: level and decline in immediate recall, and level and change in independent aspects of delayed recall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This research employs data from a large population representative sample (N = 20,650) of older individuals from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS), with repeated measures (up to eight assessments per person) of verbal memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our second aim was to identify genetic variants that associate with individual differences in the four components and to evaluate whether the associations are specific to each component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed genome wide association scans (GWAS) that had broad coverage of ~1.2 million SNP markers with the HRS genetic subsample (N = 7,486), followed by GWAS in an independent replication sample from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA; N = 6,898).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Material_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Discovery cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a nationally representative longitudinal study of U.S. households containing adults aged 50 years and older, with interviews conducted every two years, starting in 1992.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of memory trajectories are based on data from a phenotypic sample comprising HRS participants who had completed at least two assessments of verbal recall between 1996 and 2012 and were at least 50 years of age during the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scores for some individuals were excluded if recorded prior to their turning age 50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We excluded scores of individuals who had a likely diagnosis of dementia, based on a question to the respondent on whether they had been diagnosed by a healthcare provider (with Alzheimer disease, dementia, senility, or serious memory-related problem) or the respondent requiring a proxy to complete their interview.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Memory scores for these individuals were excluded for the wave in which the diagnosis was reported, the wave prior to reporting the diagnosis, and all subsequent waves when the individual was interviewed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These criteria yielded a sample of N = 20,650, with individuals assessed up to 8 times over the 16 years (125,164 observations total), with an average of 6.1 assessments per person.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenotypic sample is 57.9% female, and the self-reported racial/ethnic composition is 82.2% Non-Hispanic White (NHW), 14.1% African-American/Black, and 3.8% Hispanic/Latino.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To reduce potential bias from population stratification bias and increase comparability with the ELSA replication sample, the GWAS was limited to individuals who identified as NHW (i.e., having primarily European ancestry).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other selection criteria were having verbal memory data on at least two occasions and providing a DNA sample, resulting in N = 7,486 (57.6% female) with 65,937 observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Replication cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) is a companion study of HRS, with a nationally representative cohort of individuals living in England aged 50 and older.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study began in 2002 with 11,391 participants and has since included interviews every two years, with measures collected for the purposes of harmonizing with HRS, including assessment of verbal memory (see Steptoe et al., 2013 [42]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inclusion criteria for the present study were the same as for the HRS discovery sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Memory scores and genetic information were available for a sample of N = 6,898 unrelated individuals (53.8% female) assessed up to 6 times (41,328 observations, collected 20022012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As detailed below, we followed five analytical steps: (1) Phenotype construction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mixed effects regression models were used to evaluate the age-based trajectories and between-subject variation in trajectories of IR and rDR (analyzed separately).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four phenotypes were estimated for each individual: IR level, IR change, rDR level, and rDR change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) GWAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separate GWASs were run, first in the discovery cohort, to identify genetic loci associated with each of the four phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replication GWASs were run in the independent cohort to evaluate replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (3) SNP Comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared GWAS results across the phenotypes, and between the discovery and replication cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (4) Meta-analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted a meta-analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts to assess the robustness of the combined effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (5) Functional genomic and pathway analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the plausible biological pathways in which implicated genes play a role in memory outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Functional_genomic_and_pathway_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genes and flanking genes were identified using dbSNP and the SNP and CNV Annotation Database (SCAN) (http://www.scandb.org/newinterface/index.html).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene functions were identified using the literature search feature of the Gene Expression Analysis (GEA) tool (http://chrisarm.com/gea/lsearch/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene network analysis was conducted using the Ingenuity Knowledge Base and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA; http://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional interactions were added sourced from the Qinsight Biomedical Search Engine (Quertle LLC; Henderson, NV; https://www.quetzal-search.info/) and the BaseSpace Correlation Engine (Illumina, San Diego, CA; https://basespace.illumina.com/home/index), which summarizes evidence from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sample_characteristics_and_outcome_variables  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 1 provides selected characteristics for HRS participants in the full phenotypic sample (N = 20,650) and the NHW genotypic sample used for the GWAS (N = 7,486).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean IR and DR scores are based on the first assessment occasion for each individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the phenotypic sample, the mean score (out of 10 words) was 5.7 for IR and 4.5 for DR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full HRS sample and the NHW phenotypic sub-sample are similar in score distributions and gender ratio, but the genotypic sample was slightly younger and had memory scores that averaged 0.2 SD for both IR and DR. After adjusting for a linear effect of age, GWAS sample membership was not associated with IR or DR scores (ß = 0.02).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the full phenotypic HRS sample, IR was strongly correlated with DR (r = .77), but (as expected) not with residualized delayed recall (rDR; r = -.01), reflecting our goal of isolating the immediate and delayed components of verbal recall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 shows recall scores, including the overlap of IR and DR, as well as rDR, or the independent component of delayed scores after partialling out immediate scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aim 1 of the study was to characterize the longitudinal trajectories of the phenotypes: IR level (IR-L), IR change (IR-C), residual DR level (rDR-L) and residual DR change (rDR-C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this, we calculated and compared the estimated parameters from spline models for the four phenotypes for the HRS full phenotypic sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first slope component (s1) is a linear function of the scores obtained prior to age 60 and a second slope component (s2) is a linear function of scores obtained after age 60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There turned out to be negligible variation in slope prior to age 60 (i.e., memory performance was stable for the majority of participants; IR-C variance = 0.028, DR-C variance = 0.006, rDR-C = 0.004).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there was more between-person variation after age 60 for IR and DR (IR-C variance = 0.094, DR-C variance = 0.113, rDR-C = 0.004), the key model parameters are subject-specific intercepts (random effects) for memory level at age 60 (i.e., representing IR-L or rDR-L) and subject-specific estimates of slope (change) after age 60, representing IR-C or rDR-C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, variance in rDR-C post-60 was considerably smaller than for IR-C and DR-C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Table 2, higher recall level negatively correlated with decline for both IR (r = -.62) and DR (r = -.64), indicating that individuals with initially better recall had more rapid decline, whereas those who began lower did not decline as much across subsequent measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, rDR level was only weakly associated with decline (r = -.18), suggesting that change on recall is independent of ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evaluation_of_GWAS_results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantile-quantile (QQ) plots for the HRS sample were constructed to show the ratio of observed to expected p-values for each SNP in the four GWASs, each adjusted for three PCs (see Figs A-D in S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of SNPs fell within the 95% confidence interval of the expectation; thus, it is reasonable to assume that there is little concern for inflation (type 1 error) of the observed p-values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomic inflation factor (lambda) for each scan was close to 1 (range s = 1.001 to 1.010), and thus, not suggestive of problems with population stratification [72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, comparison scans using eight PCs showed nearly identical effect sizes and a similar pattern of p-values, and hence the three PCs controlled for in the analyses appear sufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, QQ plots for the ELSA sample did not indicate problems with population stratification (see Figs A-D in S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Meta-analysis_results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Meta-analyses of the HRS and ELSA cohorts identified four SNPs that surpassed the genome-wide significance cut-off for rDR-L, three of which were also significantly associated with IR-C, and none of which significantly associated with rDR-C or IR-L (Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All SNPs were on chromosome 19, with the TOMM40 SNPs within 6000 base pairs of each other, and the APOE SNP 19,700 base pairs away.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple SNPs from these meta-analyses reached the suggestive threshold of 5x10-06 and are reported in Supporting Information (Tables AD in S2 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QQ and Manhattan Plots from meta-analyses for the four phenotypes are shown in Supporting Information, S5 (Figs A-D in S5 Fig) and S6 Fig (Figs A-D in S6 Fig), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For characterizing the effects of the top SNPs in the TOMM40 and APOE regions (reported below), we focus on SNPs that surpassed genome-wide significance and use the single top SNP to represent each of the TOMM40 and APOE effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SNP_effects_on_rDR-L_and_IR-C_across_age_decades  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because our phenotypes reflected age-related trajectories, and due to evidence that genes have stronger effects on cognitive performance in older ages [27, 29], we evaluated whether the effect of TOMM40 on rDR-L and IR-C independent of APOE e4 differs at older age decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the HRS cohort and mixed effects modeling, additional splines were fit with the knot point at age 70 and age 80, adjusted for APOE e4 carrier status, sex, and 3 PCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When plotting the age-related rDR trajectories were stratified by presence of the rs2075650 G allele, we find that in older ages, there were larger differences in the effects of the TOMM40 allele that were independent of APOE e4 (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, for IR change, the effect of the TOMM40 rs157582 A allele that was independent of APOE e4 was evident only at age 60, when the A allele associated with a larger, negative change score (i.e., steeper decline); in older age decades, there were no differences in effects of the A allele on IR change (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gene_network_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We evaluated the networks and molecular pathways including the relationships between TOMM40, APOE, and memory phenotypes from the IPA library of canonical pathways, disease processes, and biological processes, as well as customized pathways that were within the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IPA analyses was seeded with established risk genes for AD (listed via AlzGene: APOE, BIN1, CLU, ABCA7, CR1, PICALM, MS4A6A, CD33, MS4A4E, CD2AP) and from the current study, as associated with rDR-L and IR-C, in order to elucidate relationships between genes and the variants involved in AD-related processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The network (S7 Fig), shows that TOMM40 has possible interactions or functions in conjunction with several genes (i.e., APOE, BAX, INSR, APP, VDAC4, FOXB1, SNCA, HSD17B10, HSPA4) in the pathway of influence on verbal memory, episodic memory, AD, cognitive impairment, memory deficits, and reduced hippocampal volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these pathways likely involve other genes (e.g., CLU, PICALM, BDNF, CD33, CEBPB, TNFRSF19, ABCA7, BIN1, PPARGC1A) with upstream influence from F2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The network also shows interactions between APOE and other genes in nearly every pathway to a memory and cognition-related outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we used a population-based sample repeatedly assessed on verbal memory to characterize individual trajectories of change over age, giving greater precision in assessing level and decline of memory ability than available in most other studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trajectories were constructed to reflect immediate and delayed recall after age 60, an age at which other longitudinal studies suggest consistent decline in memory ability occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One SNP (rs2075650) on chromosome 19, in the TOMM40 region, associated at the genome-wide significant level with the phenotype of delayed recall level that is independent of immediate recall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding replicated in a completely independent sample and remained in our subsequent meta-analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The meta-analysis on delayed recall level also identified two other TOMM40 SNPs (rs71352238, rs157582) and an APOE SNP (rs769449) with genome-wide significant associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional evaluation of the TOMM40 and APOE SNPs indicated that the GWAS signal for delayed recall level was mostly attributed to APOE; however, there were effects of the TOMM40 variant independent of e4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The meta-analysis on the separate phenotype of immediate recall change identified genome-wide significant SNPs in both genes (TOMM40 rs157582 and rs71352238; APOE rs769449).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional evaluation indicated that TOMM40 had not only stronger effects than APOE on immediate recall change, but also effects independent of e4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several other SNPs that reached the suggestive association level in the present study reside within genes associated with memory phenotypes in other studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More critically, our results underscore the importance for specificity in phenotypes when assessing the genetic influence on components of memory abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Discrete_components_of_verbal_memory  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An innovation of this study was to separate the components involved in different aspects of recall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas immediate recall reflects initial encoding and rehearsal, our residualized-delayed recall score, created by partialling the immediate score from the delayed score, is a distinct phenotype reflecting the pure retrieval component of memory (depicted in Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar approach has been used previously to create a pure measure of delayed memory function [79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, separating the components provided greater insight into the basis for changes in verbal memory over age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About half of the variation in decline in DR after age 60 can be attributed to decline in IR (See Supporting Information, Tables A-B in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, after adjusting for what is initially encoded, there are small individual differences in what people can retrieve and even smaller individual differences in how people decline in retrieval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genetic_specificity_for_aging-related_changes_in_verbal_memory_components  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The overarching goal of this study was to examine the complexity of verbal memory abilities over age, and whether genetic variants associate uniquely with specific components of verbal memory, represented by four phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding with regard to rDR level supports work from prior cognitive aging studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, although rs2075650, in the TOMM40 region, associates with rDR level in our study, and with episodic memory (pless_than5.0x10-08) and late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) in other studies, that effect on verbal information retrieval detected through GWAS is primarily driven by linked APOE variants [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With regard to IR change, our findings indicate that TOMM40 plays a larger role, specifically, in decline of verbal learning after age 60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, our analysis showed that there are unique effects of TOMM40 beyond APOE e4 effects on both level of delayed recall prior to age 60 and decline in immediate recall after 60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the IR-C finding, additional evaluation of the effect of the TOMM40 SNP (rs157582) indicates that it has significant effects outside of e4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon cursory assessment with TOMM40 being 16 kb upstream of e4, conclusions could be drawn that the TOMM40 SNP simply serves as a marker for the e4 effect; however, several critical pieces of information suggest otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the APOE SNP rs769449 resides 2 kb from e4 and is in high LD with it (r2 = .799) such that if the effect of TOMM40 on IR-C were attributable solely to APOE, we would have observed the effect of TOMM40 disappear when it was included in a model with rs769449 predicting IR-C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the effect of TOMM40 remained statistically significant whereas the effect of rs769449 did not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, if the signal were attributable solely to APOE, when the effect of the TOMM40 SNP was conditioned on the e4 allele (inferred from rs429358), the effect size of TOMM40 would have diminished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the effect size of TOMM40 remained the same while the effect of e4 diminished to non-significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several additional observations point towards an independent TOMM40 effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One relates to linkage disequilibrium (LD) and that the TOMM40 SNP (rs157582) is in imperfect LD with the APOE SNPs (r2 = .456 with rs769449; r2 = .590 with rs429358 [73]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these SNPs cannot serve as interchangeable proxies for one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional support comes from the observed associations with late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When both rs157581 (residing 500 bp from rs157582 on TOMM40) and rs429358 were directly genotyped and tested in separate additive logit models for associations with LOAD, they showed different degrees of effect (ORs of 2.9 and 4.1, respectively [80]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, and perhaps most surprising, is the finding that rs157582 showed statistically significant effects among e3/e3 individuals, but not those who carry e4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings suggest there is some degree of effect of TOMM40 that occurs independently of APOE e4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings are in line with several recent studies that have implemented newer methods to evaluate APOE-TOMM40 haplotype associations [81] and found TOMM40 variants influence memory performance and dementia risk beyond that conferred by the APOE e4 variant [8294].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, individuals with an APOE e3-TOMM40 VL haplotype developed LOAD an average of seven years earlier than those with the APOE e3-TOMM40 S haplotype (70.5±1.2 years vs. 77.6±2.1 years, p = 0.02 [95]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the TOMM40 polymorphism significantly influences age of disease onset for those with an e3 allele, which had been considered a low risk allele prior to these haplotype studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies have found that within APOE e3/e3 individuals, the VL variant of the TOMM40 polymorphism is associated with lower performance on episodic memory [84, 94].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study showed there were differences in effects of TOMM40 on delayed verbal memory and immediate recall change depending on APOE genotype, with notable effects among e3/e3 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given these findings, devising a study in which the TOMM40 poly-T length polymorphisms (also known as the 523 repeat) have been characterized to test the association between APOE e3/e3-TOMM40 variant haplotypes with delayed verbal recall level and immediate recall change could provide further understanding of these findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, and more relevant to genetic specificity for verbal memory, prior GWAS studies use phenotypes (such as a TICS total score) that aggregate multiple cognitive domains, including crystallized ability, fluid ability, speed, and episodic memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these processes differ in their phenotypic trajectories over age [96, 97] and genetic structure [98, 99], such aggregation may obscure genetic associations specific to memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest even greater specificity, that variation in the TOMM40/APOE region is associated with level of ability in the retrieval component of verbal memory and change in initial encoding and rehearsal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the key importance of delayed recall in discriminating degrees of cognitive impairment, partialling out the phenotype to reflect true retrieval provides a more refined measure with which to study and potentially link underlying genetic associations with impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interpretation of our findings would be clarified further by following up these results in a sample that has genotyping data and assessment of memory in non-verbal domains and probing of encoding by recognition as well as recall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biological_implications_and_specificity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings that TOMM40 and APOE associate with level of delayed recall and change in immediate recall have plausible biological mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An examination of gene interactions and protein expression through gene network analyses identified possible pathways from both genes to AD and memory-related conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, cognitively intact, older APOE e4 carriers have been shown to exhibit greater age-related reductions in hippocampal volume [100] and reduced functional activity in the right hippocampus [101].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another study of healthy older adults (ages 60 to 87), lower hippocampal volume was associated with lower recall abilities among APOE e4 carriers in combination with the TOMM40 rs11556505 T (r = 0.28, pless_than0.01, R2 = 0.08) and rs2075650 (the SNP in our study) G (r = 0.28, pless_than0.01, R2 = 0.08) risk alleles [89].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the additional effects of TOMM40 risk alleles on recall abilities, beyond effects of APOE, may be mediated via brain morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although verbal memory components may share some genetic underpinnings and biologic pathways, prior research and our findings support the notion that phenotypic specificity remains critically important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a prior study, left hippocampal body volume was shown to be associated with delayed verbal memory (r = -0.17, p less_than .05), but not immediate memory among healthy older adults, ages 55 to 83 [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another study, in which a residualized DR score was also used to remove the influences of IR, hippocampal size was associated with rDR performance, but not with IR [79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous findings have correlated verbal memory with other regions of the medial temporal lobes, outside of the hippocampus, although more recent evidence from functional neuroimaging studies of AD patients indicates that this is driven by learning rather than retrieval processes [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest the need for further investigation of the relationship between hippocampal size, other regions of the medial temporal lobe, specific component of verbal memory, and the associated genetic profile to provide greater insight into biological mechanisms for age-related differences in memory abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Repeated_measures_and_other_study_strengths  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study addressed several limitations of prior research aimed at identifying genetic loci associated with memory decline, including the use of cross-sectional data to estimate age-related change and using an index of delayed memory that is confounded with immediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We harnessed repeated measures from a large population-based study and created distinct phenotypes that better reflect the complexity of verbal memory ability and change over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from longitudinal studies of episodic memory can be limited by practice effects [26], but this is of less concern in HRS because assessments were given every two years using alternate forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reduced the potential impact of selective attrition [102] by including individuals who had participated in HRS at least two occasions within 16 assessment years (1996 to 2012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Limitations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study had several limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, our measure of verbal memory was based on a single presentation of a word list administered by a lay-interviewer and likely contains greater measurement error than other approaches using repeated presentations of a word list or multiple memory measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this would be expected to introduce noise rather than false positive results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This illustrates a significant challenge for GWAS study designs: achieving samples sufficiently large to detect the expected effect sizes often means a trade-off in measurement intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using a repeated measures design in a large sample we were able to characterize individual trajectories of age-related change and increased power compared to cross-sectional designs [103], but we still had limited power to detect additional SNP associations unique to the components of verbal memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, variance in rDR change over time was particularly small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This partially explains the difficulty in detecting associations between genetic loci and change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, there are a variety of covariates that could have been included that may mediate the association between genetic effects and later life memoryincluding indices of health and socioeconomic status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We intentionally did not incorporate these in the analyses because it is arguable that these are outcomes rather than causes of memory ability and decline (for more discussion, see page 5 of S3 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, for the GWAS in particular, there may be genetic pleiotropy between memory ability and these variables, especially educational attainment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifth, in examining the joint effect of TOMM40 and APOE on rDR-L and IR-C, we were not able to directly account for the effects of APOE e4, nor were we able to examine haplotype effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our analyses cannot confirm causality between TOMM40 and phenotypes, nor can we confirm the independence of the effect of TOMM40 given the proximity to other susceptibility genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further confirmation, the finding warrants replication with a sample in which the genotyped APOE alleles are available, as well as the TOMM40 poly-T variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current study provides evidence of genetic underpinnings for specific components of aging-related verbal memory performance, delayed recall at age 60 that is unconfounded with attention or memory span, and decline in immediate recall after age 60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results underscore the importance of studying phenotypes that represent distinct components of memory, or other aspects of cognition, when assessing genetic influences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One identified genetic variant, a SNP in the TOMM40 region, has biological plausibility for its effect on delayed recall beyond its association with APOE e4 risk because of findings linking TOMM40, hippocampal formation and volume, and delayed recall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With regard to change in immediate recall ability, there is evidence for the genetic effects of both TOMM40 and APOE, as well as independent effects of TOMM40 among individuals who do not carry the APOE e4 allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings need confirmation in other samples, but support the existence of differential effects of TOMM40 and APOE on specific components of verbal memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
