Projected Scenarios for Coastal First Nations Fisheries Catch Potential under Climate Change: Management Challenges and Opportunities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies have demonstrated ways in which climate-related shifts in the distributions and relative abundances of marine species are expected to alter the dynamics and catch potential of global fisheries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these studies assess impacts on large-scale commercial fisheries, few efforts have been made to quantitatively project impacts on small-scale subsistence and commercial fisheries that are economically, socially and culturally important to many coastal communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study uses a dynamic bioclimate envelope model to project scenarios of climate-related changes in the relative abundance, distribution and richness of 98 exploited marine fishes and invertebrates of commercial and cultural importance to First Nations in coastal British Columbia, Canada.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Declines in abundance are projected for most of the sampled species under both the lower (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 2.6) and higher (RCP 8.5) emission scenarios (-15.0% to -20.8%, respectively), with poleward range shifts occurring at a median rate of 10.3 to 18.0 km decade-1 by 2050 relative to 2000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a cumulative decline in catch potential is projected coastwide (-4.5 to -10.7%), estimates suggest a strong positive correlation between the change in relative catch potential and latitude, with First Nations territories along the northern and central coasts of British Columbia likely to experience less severe declines than those to the south.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a strong negative correlation is projected between latitude and the number of species exhibiting declining abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These trends are shown to be robust to alternative species distribution models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study concludes by discussing corresponding management challenges that are likely to be encountered under climate change, and by highlighting the value of joint-management frameworks and traditional fisheries management approaches that could aid in offsetting impacts and developing site-specific mitigation and adaptation strategies derived from local fishers knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Theoretical and empirical evidence of the influence of anthropogenic climate change on the productivity and ecology of marine ecosystems has been witnessed globally, spanning tropical, temperate, and polar regions [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over 90 per cent of observed warming has accumulated within marine ecosystems, with sea surface temperature (SST) projected to warm between 0.6°C and 2.0°C by the end of the 21st century [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies argue that climate change and the resulting range of biological responses, such as altered species distributions [2,3,6,7], phenology [4], physiology [8], and marine biodiversity [9,10], are likely to impact fisheries [1,11,12] and the societies that depend upon them [13,14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, projected changes in fisheries catch potential [12] could result in, or exacerbate, socio-economic impacts on fisheries through reduced food and economic security [15,16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While available climate change impact assessments on marine fisheries frequently focus on large-scale commercial sectors, few efforts have been made to generate quantitative scenarios of potential effects on small-scale fisheries that exhibit social, cultural, and economic dependence on marine ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small-scale commercial and subsistence fisheries are of critical importance to food security and poverty alleviation worldwide [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these fisheries are also susceptible to climate change impacts through shifts in distributions, compositions and potential yields of fish stocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First Nations situated along the Pacific coast of Canada are representative of Indigenous communities whose small-scale subsistence and commercial fishing practices and diversified harvest and storage of marine resources, such as salmon, have played essential roles in the development of their cultural complexity [1821].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These Nations have demonstrated exemplary resilience in the face of anthropogenic and environmental change for millennia, having occupied this region for more than 10,000 years [22,23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have therefore attained considerable experience in accommodating environmental change and interpreting ecological indicators and relationships through traditional ecological knowledge (TEK)[2427].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the intrinsic importance of marine ecosystems to coastal First Nations, as cited extensively in the archaeological and anthropological literature [2831], unprecedented climate change [32] poses a considerable threat to First Nations food and economic security, cultural practices, and spiritual values through fisheries [27,33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many First Nations have noted significant climate-related impacts manifesting in decreased availability of traditional foods through declining abundances, altered growth and migration patterns, and reduced predictability previously established through TEK and traditional phenological knowledge (TPK; [24,27,34,35]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is necessary to improve our understanding of challenges that are likely to be faced increasingly by Indigenous peoples under climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This endeavor can be supported by identifying scenarios likely to occur under climate change, thereby allowing for the development and implementation of appropriate mitigation and/or adaptation strategies that are informed by First Nations TEK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increasingly, scenario-based assessments have enabled us to examine questions concerning the impacts of climate change on marine fisheries [15,36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plausible scenarios constructed from expert knowledge have been employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to serve as a framework for investigating key questions and for engaging in discussions regarding mitigation and adaptation prospects [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As models have been used in fisheries science as necessary tools to address uncertainty and produce defensible management strategies from existing knowledge [38], the integration of climate projections with fisheries models has enabled development of useful scenarios outlining potential effects on marine ecosystems and fisheries [39,40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, species distribution models (SDMs) have been used in conjunction with climate projections to explore trends in distributional shifts [7,41,42], species turnover [43], and corresponding impacts on the biophysics and economics of global fisheries [15,16] under climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies have qualitatively explored factors influencing the resilience of First Nations in British Columbia [24,44], highlighted the potential application of TEK in understanding and responding to climate change [45,46], and produced frameworks for assessing the vulnerability of remote Indigenous communities to climate change [47,48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study progresses a step further by projecting plausible quantitative scenarios of how coastal First Nations key marine resources might be affected by climate change, identifying corresponding fisheries management challenges that would likely emerge under these scenarios, and discussing potential adaptive responses to these specific challenges informed by traditional fisheries management strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this, a SDM driven by outputs from global coupled ocean-atmosphere-biogeochemistry earth system models was used to project changes in potential yields of species targeted by coastal First Nations fisheries under climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With reference to these results, we discuss potential climate-resilient pathways that draw from examples of First Nations traditional fisheries management strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Case_study_areas  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While referred to collectively as First Peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast [49,50], First Nations residing along coastal BC vary with respect to culture, traditions and diet associated with their fishing practices, making it inappropriate to assess climate-related impacts on First Nations as if they were a single, homogenous entity [34,51].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, First Nations were purposively selected from each of the seven coastal administrative regions defined by the BC First Nations Fisheries Council (FNFC), forming a sample of groups with diverse marine resources, geographical locations, territorial sizes, and treaty statuses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, 16 of 78 First Nations identified near BCs coastline were selected, 12 of which fall under three overarching councils negotiating in the BC treaty process: the Council of the Haida Nation, the Tsimshian Nations Treaty Society, and the Maa-nulth First Nations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the purpose of this study, these 16 Nations are referred to collectively under their respective treaty councils, with estimated populations recorded as of December 2013 (Table 1) [52, 53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approximate sizes of the domestic fishing areas were derived from the Statement of Intent boundary shapefile using ArcGIS (see S1 Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The biogeographical characteristics of coastal BC are characterized by considerable terrestrial and marine-based diversity due to a temperate climate and coastal upwelling system that generates nutrient-rich waters [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions yield highly productive environments with complex marine food webs and diverse coastal landscapes, from rocky intertidal zones, shallow rocky reefs, kelp forests, sandy nearshore areas, and estuarine ecosystems [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these regions share similar species assemblages and are characterized by comparable environmental conditions (e.g., oceanic currents and wind-driven upwelling) [54], the FNFCs administrative regions intersect with five distinct ecological regions: the North Coast, comprising the Hecate Strait and Dixon Entrance; Haida Gwaii, which includes the waters surrounding the islands; the Central Coast, including Queen Charlotte Sound, Queen Charlotte Strait, and the southern tip of Hecate Strait; the Strait of Georgia; and the west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) [5559].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First Nations are likely exposed to different climate-related impacts on fisheries due to the differing ecological and biogeographical characteristics of these regions and to differing traditional and commercial harvests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First Nations domestic fishing areas (DFAs) were derived from the approximate Statement of Intent (SOI) boundaries registered with the BC Treaty Commission as of October 2004, which were converted to 0.5° latitudinal by 0.5° longitudinal grid-cells to correspond with downscaled global climate model grids (S1 Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these boundaries do not signify the full extent of territory previously used by First Nations, particularly with respect to the sharing of resources between communities [44,51,60,61], they serve to illustrate approximate areas requested by First Nations for FSC and commercial fishing purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selection_of_species  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A sample of culturally and commercially important species was identified from peer-reviewed literature, government and non-governmental organisations reports, treaty agreements, and First Nations reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ninety-eight speciescomprising marine and diadromous fish, shellfish, and invertebrateswere selected (sample of species harvested for food, social, and ceremonial [FSC] purposes summarized in Table 2 [30,6269]; full list of commercial and FSC species available in S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This list is not intended to be a complete representation of the resources used by coastal First Nations or to indicate relative importance, but a summary restricted to a sample of key marine fishes, shellfish and invertebrates harvested by First Nations, as documented in the available literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While also contributing to First Nations traditional harvests, marine mammals, plants and birds were not the focus of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Projecting_effects_of_climate_change_on_First_Nations__fisheries  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A dynamic bioclimate envelope model (DBEM) [39,70] was used to model changes to the distributions and relative abundances of the studied species under two climate change scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current (19712000) species distributions were obtained using an SDM developed by the Sea Around Us Project [49,71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model determines distributions of marine fishes and invertebrates by employing a set of filters including: (i) presence in FAO area(s); (ii) latitudinal range; (iii) range-limiting polygons; (iv) depth range; (v) habitat preferences; and (vi) the effect of equatorial submergence (for detailed methodology, please refer to [71]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data for these filters were primarily derived from FishBase [49,72], SeaLifeBase [73] and the Encyclopedia of Life [74,75], which were supplemented or cross-checked with data collected from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) reports, and peer-reviewed literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For species with limited life history records, data for species within the same genus were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Range-limiting polygons were produced using known latitudinal and longitudinal ranges and the resulting distributional maps were cross-checked with AquaMaps [76], the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species [77], and FAOs Aquatic Species Distribution Viewer [78] (see S1 Data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on modelled current distributions, the DBEM simulates changes in the relative abundance of each species in each 0.5° latitudinal x 0.5° longitudinal cell of the ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By overlaying the current predicted relative abundance on modelled ocean properties from Earth System Models for the contemporary period (19712000), we identified species preferences to environmental conditions that are defined by sea water temperature (surface and bottom), salinity, sea ice concentration, bathymetry and habitat types (e.g., estuaries, seamounts, shelf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species carrying capacities (K) in each cell (i) are positively related to inferred environmental preferences and the environmental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in relative abundance (Abdi) in each cell (i) at each time step (t) were simulated based on the following algorithm (see Cheung et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2011 for details):  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(1)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Abdi is the relative abundance of cell i, G is the intrinsic population growth, and Lji and Iji are settled larvae and net migrated adults from surrounding cells (j), respectively [9,79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recruitment within the model thereby operates as a function of larval dispersal, settlement, and mortality, which is temperature dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the DBEM does not aim to represent the natural short-term (inter-annual) variability of recruitment; instead it aims to represent the long-term mean changes in production of the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intrinsic growth rate of a population is calculated as  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(2)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where r is the intrinsic rate of population increase and Ki is the population carrying capacity for cell i that is expressed as a function of the habitat suitability, and theoretical unfished biomass of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An advection-diffusion-reaction model is used to account for larval dispersal according to ocean conditions, while adult abundances diffuse following a gradient of habitat suitability [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details regarding these methods were previously published by Cheung et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2009, 2010; [9,12,42]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model simulation was driven by projected changes in ocean properties under two climate change scenarios: RCP 8.5 and 2.6, representing the high and low greenhouse gas emission scenarios respectively [37,80,81].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ocean propertiesincluding sea surface temperature, sea bottom temperature, salinity, oxygen concentration, surface advection, and net primary productionwere projected from NOAAs Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratorys IPCC-class earth system model (GFDL ESM2M; [82]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the outputs from the DBEM, we calculated changes in species relative abundances, distributions, and richness, as well as corresponding changes in relative catch potential using species relative abundances and projected changes in primary productivity for each cell (methods based on [70] and [42]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The latitudinal centroid (LC) of each species was calculated as  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(3)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Lati is the latitudinal centre of the spatial cell (i) and n is the total number of cells where abundance is greater than 0 [9,83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The range shift, in kilometers, was then calculated from the difference between the latitudinal centroid of the projected and reference years as follows [70]:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(4)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where r = 6378.2 km, the approximate radius of the earth, and LCm and LCn are the latitudinal centroids in years m and n. Median values were used to estimate range shifts by taxonomic group in order to remove anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative change in catch potential (%) was estimated from mean inferred current abundance (19712000), change in net primary production, and range area, as represented by the following algorithm,  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(5)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where P and A are the net primary productivity and area of cell i at time step t, respectively [12,36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to limited landings data, the results were reported as percent change in relative catch potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in species richness were inferred by modifying relative average abundance data for the projected (20412060) and reference (19912010) periods to reflect presence (1) or absence (0) within a given cell and summed to yield species richness for each cell within the area of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference was then obtained between the projected and reference periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The threshold used to assess species presence or absence was 0 (Values  greater than  0 were assigned a value of 1), which represents an extremely conservative estimate given that species thresholds would differ depending on the spatial density and dynamics of the populations [84].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Relative changes in commercial catch potential (%) were calculated for each 0.5° longitudinal x 0.5° latitudinal grid-cell situated in BCs waters within Canadas exclusive economic zone (EEZ) using 20-year average abundances for 2050 (20412060) relative to 2000 (19912010) obtained from the DBEM simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species were aggregated by commercial fishery, noting the proportion of species included in the analysis relative to those included in each fisherys quota (S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regional impacts on FSC fisheries were estimated by using First Nations DFAs as outlined by the SOI boundaries submitted to the BC Treaty Commission, with the change in relative catch potential calculated for each species within each DFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Annual landed values by taxon or fishery (e.g., herring spawn-on-kelp) between 2001 and 2010 were obtained from the BC Ministry of Agricultures annual reports and averaged to provide mean annual landed revenue [8589].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Projected changes in relative catch potential for each commercial fishery under RCPs 2.6 and 8.5 were subsequently used to derive an estimate of changes in mean annual landed revenue (in 2010 CAD) given the approximate proportion of licenses held by First Nations [90](S3 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in landed revenue were calculated using the following equation:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(6)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where R is the projected change in First Nations mean annual landed revenue by 2050, R represents First Nations estimated current mean annual landed revenue (20012010), and CP represents the projected per cent change in relative catch potential by 2050.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data outlining landed revenue in the Heiltsuk commercial intertidal bivalve fishery and First Nations participation in the commercial green sea urchin fishery, tuna fishery, and groundfish trawl and hook and lines fisheries were not available, and were therefore not included in the estimates of changes in landed revenue in the EEZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sensitivity_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results obtained by Jones and Cheung [42] for two additional SDMs, Maxent [91] and AquaMaps [92], were used to analyse the sensitivity of relative catch potential and latitudinal range shifts obtained under RCP 8.5 to alternative SDM approaches and their underlying assumptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast with the DBEMs discriminative approach that combines mechanistic and statistical tools, Maxent and AquaMaps use statistical methods to produce bioclimate envelopes that represent species relative habitat suitability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species current distributions were determined by associating presence-only data with 30-year averaged environmental data (19712000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from AquaMaps and Maxent were available for 31 and 33 of the 98 species included in this study, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Impacts_on_species__relative_abundance__distribution_and_richness  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Declines in relative abundance were projected by 2050 (relative to 2000) for the majority of sampled species (87 of 98 spp.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  within British Columbias marine environment under both scenarios of climate change, with evidence of latitudinal and regional trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) and Pacific sardines (Sardinops sagax) were projected to increase in abundance within BCs marine environment under both scenarios, while manila clams (Venerupis philippinarum) were projected to increase in abundance by 14.5% under RCP 8.5, The remaining species (8 spp.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  showed little change, with obtained projections oscillating around the baseline (-8.3 to +4.6%)(S4 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A poleward range shift in mean abundance by 2050 was projected for all species examined, with an estimated total median rate of 10.3 to 18.0 km decade-1 under the lower and upper scenarios of climate change respectively (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A median rate of 10.1 to 17.8 km decade-1 was projected for demersal species, while pelagic species were projected to move polewards at a median rate of 13.6 to 33.3 km decade-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rates tended to increase under the upper scenario of climate change relative to the lower scenario (68 of 98 spp.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the remaining species (30 spp.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  exhibited similar rates of poleward movement under both scenarios (i.e., within 7 km decade-1 for 26 of 98 spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), while only a few (4 spp.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  exhibited slower rates of poleward movement (S5 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While most species were projected to decline in relative abundance and to shift polewards relative to BCs marine environment by 2050, species richness along coastal BC was projected to change little under either scenario of climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absolute number of species that occurred within each cell (i.e., with a habitat suitability of greater than zero) reflected gains or losses of up to 3 species per cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar latitudinal patterns to those observed for relative abundance and distribution were again evident, with greater losses in species richness likely to occur towards the southern coast of British Columbia, falling primarily between 48°N and 51°N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, changes in species richness were projected off the coasts of Alaska and California, which mark the northern and southern latitudinal extents of many of the species distributions included in this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To the authors knowledge, this study offers the first attempt to develop quantitative projections of climate-related impacts on small-scale fisheries and to explore how traditional fisheries management strategies could be used to respond to specific challenges inferred from these projections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario-based framework thereby provides an opportunity to proactively identify challenges that are likely to arise from climate change, with specific application to local risk assessments for small-scale, traditional fisheries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The projected declines in relative catch potential across each of the coastal First Nations territories under both the lower (RCP 2.6) and upper (RCP 8.5) scenarios of climate change yield three key questions that are relevant to fisheries globally under climate change: (1) how do we mitigate impacts to fisheries catch potential that are unequally distributed?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) how do we account for the externalization of impacts to fisheries?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and (3) how can we effectively implement joint-management frameworks that balance objectives?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this study presents examples of potential climate-resilient pathways that might be used to respond to these challenges in the context of coastal British Columbia, including resource sharing agreements that redistribute impacts, local mariculture operations that contribute to offsetting declines in catch potential, and joint-management frameworks that facilitate collaborative management approaches, community-based research would be an essential requirement to identify viable options that fully accommodate each communitys respective concerns and values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings from this study provide the foundation to guide future research to address this set of questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the estimates derived from this analysis are not intended to represent fisheries management guidelines, the underlying trends that emerge illustrate the value of using quantitatively derived scenarios to examine potential site-specific impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the latitudinal trends in declining catch potential projected in this analysis can be used to develop management strategies for addressing spatial trade-offs associated with the redistribution of marine resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this approach suggests key stakeholders or species that might be affected, allowing for options to be discussed proactively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
