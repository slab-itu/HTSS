Fine-scale population genetic structure of the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) in a human-dominated western Terai Arc Landscape, India  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite massive global conservation strategies, tiger populations continued to decline until recently, mainly due to habitat loss, human-animal conflicts, and poaching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These factors are known to affect the genetic characteristics of tiger populations and decrease local effective population sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) at the foothills of the Himalaya is one of the 42 source sites of tigers around the globe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, information on how landscape features and anthropogenic factors affect the fine-scale spatial genetic structure and variation of tigers in TAL is needed to develop proper management strategies for achieving long-term conservation goals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We document, for the first time, the genetic characteristics of this tiger population by genotyping 71 tiger samples using 13 microsatellite markers from the western region of TAL (WTAL) of 1800 km2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we aimed to estimate the genetic variability, population structure, and gene flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microsatellite markers indicated that the levels of allelic diversity (MNA = 6.6) and genetic variation (Ho = 0.50, HE = 0.64) were slightly lower than those reported previously in other Bengal tiger populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed moderate gene flow and significant genetic differentiation (FST= 0.060) and identified the presence of cryptic genetic structure using Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was low and significantly asymmetric migration between the two main subpopulations of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve and the Corbett Tiger Reserve in WTAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sibship relationships indicated that the functionality of the corridor between these subpopulations may be retained if the quality of the habitat does not deteriorate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that gene flow is not adequate in view of changing land use matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss the need to maintain connectivity by implementing the measures that have been suggested previously to minimize the level of human disturbance, including relocation of villages and industries, prevention of encroachment, and banning sand and boulder mining in the corridors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

1_Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Knowledge of the genetic structure and gene flow in wild animal populations is crucial for making decisions to improve their sustainability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factors known to influence the genetic structure and gene flow in animals include behavioral traits such as dispersal, social behavior and mating systems [1, 2], landscape features [3, 4, 5], availability of resources [6], and climate change [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene flow is often considered beneficial for maintaining local genetic variation as it counteracts the effects of genetic drift and spreads potentially adaptive alleles [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, gene flow might counteract local adaptations by importing maladaptive traits, by genetic swamping or by disrupting locally adaptive gene complexes [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced gene flow between populations results in isolation and an isolated population may accrue significant genetic differences from other populations of the same species [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Large carnivores have the ability to go across long distances and endure in diverse environmental conditions [11, 12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, during the last two centuries, many large carnivore species have faced severe threats as their geographic ranges have contracted and habitats have fragmented [13, 14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of habitat will constrain movements, thus reducing population densities and sizes [15, 16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small populations always prone to demographic stochasticity, not just in a fragmented landscapes or small protected areas [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shrinkage in geographic range and habitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic disturbances may also lead to humancarnivore conflict [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, fragmentation and loss of habitat result in the isolation of populations, which in the long-term reduces genetic variation and increases extinction probability due to inbreeding and reduced fitness [19, 20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of genetic variability in many highly vagile and long-ranging species, such as Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis) [21], pumas (Puma concolor) [22], Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) [23], brown bears (Ursus arctos) [24], jaguars (Panthera onca) [25], and Isle Royale wolves (Canis lupus) [26] has been affected by reduced movements of individuals together with other ecological/biological factors that have inhibited migrating individuals from contributing to gene pools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As genetic variability is often directly associated with the survival of individuals, knowledge of genetic variation and fine-scale spatial structuring is essential for endangered species, such as the tiger (Panthera tigris).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, knowledge of the patterns of gene flow is crucial for developing conservation plans by identifying population units and source populations that require management [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tiger is an iconic species for the conservation initiatives because of its role as an apex predator in various ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All 13 tiger range countries have been experiencing profound economic growth over the last two decades [27], and as a consequence, urbanization and encroachment of habitats for extensive infrastructure development have imposed unprecedented pressures on tiger habitats [28, 29, 30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  India is home to about 70% of the global tiger population [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is found in six tiger landscape complexes in India [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, the Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) of 42,700 km2, one of the 42 global source sites of tigers [33], is a unique habitat in the foothills of the Himalaya, notable for the richness of prey species for tigers [34, 35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAL has a denser human population (over 500 people/km2) than the national average in India (300 people/km2) [36], hence most of the tiger habitat in TAL has been encroached upon for development or increased agriculture production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tiger is found in patchy habitats with forests, agricultural land, and human habitations in the TAL region of India [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The western region of TAL (WTAL) forms the northern distribution edge of the Bengal tiger in the Indian subcontinent [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WTAL, there are two protected areas, the Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR) and the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these two, CTR is the only source population of tigers in this area, and is responsible for maintaining genetic connectivity among the entire northwestern tiger population of TAL [32] and possibly for the central to eastern part of TAL as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174371.g001  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several ecological studies have emphasized the need to reduce anthropogenic pressure and restore corridors to provide a better opportunity for large mammals to move between the protected areas in WTAL [36, 37, 38, 39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In RTR, loss of connectivity in the ChillaMotichur corridor resulted in the extinction of the tigers from the western part of RTR [38] (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Johnsingh and Negi [34] reported that tigers are rare also in the RTRCTR corridor and have gone extinct in the four forest divisions of WTAL and suggested several management measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Harihar et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [37] and Harihar and Pandav [39] suggested many measures (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  relocation of villages in the corridor and protected areas) to reduce anthropogenic pressure and restore habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reduction of anthropogenic pressure has been shown to be effective in tiger management in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the Gujjars, a pastoralist community in WTAL, were relocated from the eastern part of RTR, facilitating the recolonization of this habitat by tigers from the source population of CTR [37, 38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reducing the anthropogenic pressure and relocating human habitations from the tigers natural habitat will eventually curtail the risk of inbreeding, territorial fights, humanwildlife conflicts, and local extinctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These have been the major conservation tactics of the National Tiger Conservation Authority of the Government of India to secure inviolate and crucial tiger habitats across India [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the absence of ecological and biological details on movements of tigers, genetic characteristics can be used to understand the responses of species to the landscape and anthropogenic features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most genetic studies conducted on the Bengal tiger have been either in some way focused on the global status [41, 42] or were carried out in different tiger landscapes or regions, such as the Central and Peninsular [43, 44], Western (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve) [45] and Sundarbans [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the current knowledge of the tigers ecology, there is no information on the gene flow and genetic structure of the tiger population especially in WTAL, which holds the largest number of tigers [32], except from mitochondrial (mtDNA) markers [47,48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic variation in mtDNA was found to be low in the TAL tiger population and this population was found to be distinct from central Indian tigers due to the presence of a different mtDNA haplotype [47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the TAL, there was some evidence for genetic isolation of the tigers west of the river Ganges, which is in the western part of the RTR, while the rest of the TAL was found to hold a uniform tiger population [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Therefore, we sampled tigers across most of the WTAL region and assessed the level of genetic connectivity and the populations genetic structure in this globally significant tiger landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the previous ecological knowledge and the lack of genetic information, the present study focused on the following objectives: (1) genetic characterization and determination of population structure; (2) determination of the effect of anthropogenic pressure and recent developmental activity on genetic structure; (3) tracing the demographic history of the Bengal tiger in WTAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

2_Material_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
21_Ethics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All the blood, tissue and skin samples used in the present study were from tigers that had died naturally or in conflicts, and were provided by the Forest Department, Uttarakhand, to the national wildlife reference sample repository at the Wildlife Institute of India.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tiger scat samples were collected noninvasively without animal capture or handling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, sample collection did not require any handling of the animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All necessary permissions to collect and store the samples at the national wildlife reference sample repository were obtained from the Ministry of Forest, Environment and Climate Change, Government of India and Forest Department, Uttarakhand (letter No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1/29/2003-PT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

22_Study_area  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study was carried out in WTAL, comprising an area of 1800 km2, including RTR (Rajaji Tiger Reserve), CTR (Corbett Tiger Reserve) and the adjoining forest areas, falling within the Bijnore, Lansdown, Ramnagar, Terai West, Central and Terai East forest divisions (FD) of TAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several identified corridors (such as Rajaji-Corbett, Kosi river and Nihal Bhakra) connecting tiger reserves and FDs in WTAL (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

23_Sample_collection_and_extraction_of_DNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A total of 71 tiger samples (59 tissue or blood samples, 12 scat samples) available at the Wildlife Institute of India were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All tissue, blood and scat samples were collected between 2005 and 2014 across WTAL (RTR, n = 15; CTR, n = 27 and Terai west, central and east FDs, n = 15 and Ramnagar FDs, n = 14) by the Forest Department of Uttarakhand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scat samples (n = 12; collected in 2009) were used previously in a study by Singh et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extractions of DNA from the scat and tissue/blood samples were carried out using QIAamp DNA Stool and DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Germany), respectively, and all necessary precautions were taken to avoid contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

24_Genetic_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


3_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
31_Error_rate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We did not observe any allelic dropout or false alleles in the tested tissue samples, which comprised 20% (n = 12) of all tissue samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the scat samples, genotyping error rate varied among loci, however, ADO rate ranged from 0% to 17% and FA between 0 to 5% (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean allele dropout rate was 5%, which is comparable to the reported error rate in other studies [86, 87].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Null allele frequency ranged from 0.01 to 0.27 across the loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 13 loci, four (PttE5, PttF4, PUN100 and FCA090) showed a frequency of more than 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also checked for null alleles within individual sampling locations from WTAL tiger populations and found indications that several loci have null alleles, but this was not consistent over the different sampling sites (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

32_Genetic_diversity__departure_from_HWE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All the markers (n = 13) were polymorphic, with 410 alleles (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basic genetic diversity values, measured by the mean number of alleles (MNA) and allelic richness (AR), were 6.69 and 6.57, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed and expected heterozygosity in WTAL were 0.50 and 0.64, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deviations from HWE were inferred for five loci (PttE5, PttF4, PttD5, PUN100 and FCA090) in CTR and in six loci (PttF4, PttD5, PUN327, PUN100, FCA232 and FCA090) in the RTR tiger populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the data were tested globally, it was found that only three loci (PttF4, PUN100 and FCA090) were consistently showing deviations across the sampling sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These three loci also showed the high frequency of the null allele (PttF4, PUN100, FCA090; Table 1) across the sampling site (populations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, consistent HWE deviation in these three loci might be due to the null allele, and it can bias the several genetic analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, these three loci were excluded from subsequent analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant linkage disequilibrium was found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean inbreeding coefficient (FIS) was significantly different from zero and was positive for both populations (0.18 for CTR and 0.31 for RTR) and the overall value was 0.23 (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

33_Effective_population_size_and_demographic_history  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effective population size was estimated to be 81.2 (95% CI: 47.7195.9) for the CTR and 46.8 (13.6 to infinite) for RTR populations (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the BOTTLENECK analysis showed that there was no consistent or strong signal for a departure of heterozygosity from mutation drift equilibrium (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, all allele frequency distributions were typical (L-shaped) to non-bottlenecked populations in WTAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Garza and Williamson [61], suggested that values of the G-W index lower than 0.68 is evidence of a bottleneck, whereas values greater than 0.68 would denote no bottleneck history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present data set, the G-W values were between 0.73 and 0.77 (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

34_Population_structure__gene_flow_and_migration_rate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Bayesian cluster analysis with STRUCTURE indicated two as the most probable number of genetic clusters (K = 2), by the mean likelihood (mean ln P (k) = -1267) [65] and Delta K value [66].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both with and without prior knowledge of sampling locations yielded two population clusters, but the clustering pattern was slightly stricter with the locprior than without.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without the locprior model it was found that both populations shared ancestry and only 50% of the individuals were completely assigned (q greater than 0.7), while 50% of the individuals showed mixed ancestry (qless_than0.7) (Fig 2a and 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, using the locprior model all of the individuals were completely assigned to their respective sampling locations, except for one individual sampled from Rajaji that showed proximity to the CTR population (see S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the separate analysis of only CTR and the adjoining FDs, we found a similar clustering (Fig 2c and 2d) pattern and detected that individual from the west; central and east FDs in WTAL formed a separate cluster, while individuals from the CTR and Ramnagar were assigned to another cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Population clustering analysis with spatial information implemented in TESS gave results similar to that of STRUCTURE with locprior information and suggested that there are two clusters in WTAL, with a few individuals migrating between these (see S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GENELAND inferred four clusters (k = 4), but most of the individuals were assigned only to three clusters with high spatial consistency and clearly defined cluster boundaries (Fig 2e), and only four individuals were assigned to the fourth cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken as a whole, the different Bayesian clustering methods converged in identifying two distinct genetic clusters, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RTR and CTR including adjoining FDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third cluster detected by GENELAND supports the subdivision of CTR and its adjoining FDs also identified by STRUCTURE (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multivariate DAPC identified K = 3 or 4 as the optimal number of clusters according to the Bayesian information criteria (see S3a Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DAPC output supports the findings of the other Bayesian clustering methods (STRUCTURE, TESS and GENELAND) that there are at least two populations in WTAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subdivision in CTR and adjoining FDs identified by STRUCTURE and GENELAND was not as clear in the DAPC analysis, as the spatial extant of the clusters of CTR and its adjoining FDs (see S3b Fig) overlapped substantially although the centroids were separate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sPCA (see S4 Fig) and GLSI from AIS (Fig 3) revealed variation in allele frequency from western RTR to CTR and its adjoining forest divisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, shade gradients in sPCA quantify the degree of genetic differentiation and the observed large value also reveals that the tigers from WTAL form two genetic clusters (see S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pairwise FST value (FST = 0.060, p = 0.01) between RTR and CTR tiger populations in WTAL suggested moderate historical gene flow among the populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of genetic differentiation in CTR and adjoining forest divisions suggested high gene flow between these populations (FST values ranged 0.01 to 0.04, Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMOVA analyses revealed that most of the variance (93.14%) originates from within the populations while variance between populations and among group is less, i.e., 1.56% and 4.54% respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FST value calculated with AMOVA (FST = 0.061; pless_than0.001) also suggests significant differentiation between the populations (S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long-term migration using BAYESASS resulted in low and asymmetric migration rates, more from CTR to RTR (0.089%) than from RTR to CTR (0.007%) (Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GENECLASS 2.0 detected only two first-generation migrants from CTR to RTR and one that had migrated from RTR to CTR (S3 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of the sibship assignment analysis carried out using COLONY are shown in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shared sibship between tigers from different populations is an indication of migration, while the frequency of siblings within a population indicates the effective population size and number of residents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were more full and half sibship assignments within populations than between populations (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of a within-population sibship suggests that most of the individuals in Corbett and Rajaji are residents, but the existence of between-population sibship indicates migration of tigers between the populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the number of half sibship is greater than the number of full sibship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTR and its adjoining FDs have more sibship than RTR (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

35_Prey_density_and_disturbance_factors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitative assessment of distribution of wild prey species and their abundance (frequency of occurrence i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  number of segments with presence signs/total segments sampled), habitat quality characteristics (wildlife dung density, percent canopy cover and tree density), and the extent of anthropogenic factors (dung and sightings of livestock i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cattle and buffalo, tracks and sightings of domestic dogs and people, lopping and cutting signs) showed that WTAL had no large scale differences in the habitat quality and abundance of prey species but protected areas are relatively better in these aspects than other FDs (Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the population west of CTR experiences a comparatively high level of anthropogenic disturbance compared with that in the east (Table 5) [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity of night light pollution is high in the RajajiCorbett corridor due to development of towns in Kotdwar (Fig 1), which was also reported by Qureshi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [88].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Harihar and Pandav [39] also reported that the RajajiCorbett corridor experiences more anthropogenic disturbance compared with the Kosi river corridor, in the eastern part of CTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


4_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
41_Genetic_diversity_and_demographic_history  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study revealed the existence of a moderate level of allelic diversity and genetic variation (HO = 0.50, HE = 0.64; AR = 6.5) in tiger populations from WTAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, all of these estimates are lower than those reported in Bengal tiger populations from other regions (HO = 0.65 to 0.71, HE = 0.74 to0.81, AR = 7.76) in India [42, 89], though, they are not directly comparable with the present study because of different markers used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower level of genetic variation in WTAL compared to other Bengal tiger populations might be due to the location of the populations at the northern limit of the tiger distribution range and due to a stepping-stone type of migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Populations at the edge of the distribution range of a species often have lower genetic diversity as suggested by the rear-edge [90] or abundant-center hypotheses [91].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mammals having demographically challenged populations history, often exhibit lower heterozygosity (HE = 0.502Â±0.027) in comparison with stable, viable populations (HE = 0.677Â±0.012) [92].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the disruption of gene flow between populations due to recent (in the last century) anthropogenic activities in this region is most likely responsible for the observed genetic erosion, and inbreeding (FIS) has probably already affected the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Philopatric felids that are threatened by poaching are known to have high FIS value as have been reported by other studies in viz tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) [43, 46], African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus) [93], African lion (Panthera leo) [94], puma (Puma concolor) [95], and ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) [96].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent habitat loss and forest fragmentation have reduced genetic diversity and increased genetic differentiation within the Bengal tiger populations in other regions [44, 46, 97].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across the globe, large carnivores face similar threats and experience massive declines in their population sizes and geographic ranges [98], which may have resulted in low levels of genetic variation [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the present study did not find any signatures of a recent demographic bottleneck in the WTAL population but the genetic methods used do not always detect recent population declines [99].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, future increases in genetic drift within the WTAL population will probably lead to a more pronounced loss of genetic diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

42_Population_structure__gene_flow_and_migration_rate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found evidence that the tigers in WTAL are genetically structured forming at least two populations using both Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tigers disperse over long distances, and forest corridors facilitate the movements between subpopulations and thus are important for maintaining the meta-population or for population sinks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WTAL is a good quality habitat for tigers due to the high prey density and presence of moderate forest cover [36]; however, recent ecological studies (Table 5) show a high disturbance within WTAL; for example, because of night light in this landscape (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study supports the assumption that recent (in the last century) population fragmentation and increased urbanization have an impact on the genetic structure of the Bengal tiger in WTAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significant genetic differentiation and moderate gene flow (FST = 0.060) between CTR and RTR provide evidence that the RajajiCorbett corridor is more affected by anthropogenic disturbance in comparison to Kosi River and Nihal Bhakra corridors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significant differentiation and high gene flow between CTR and Ramnagar FD (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FST = 0.04) suggest that the corridor between these populations is functional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no differentiation (FST = 0.01) between CTR and the Terai East, Central and West FDs, indicating that there is sufficient migration and gene flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the eastern parts of CTR experience relatively low disturbance compared to the western part of CTR (Table 5), hence, the eastern part of CTR is considered as a contiguous tiger habitat and has maintained a high rate of gene flow compared to west of CTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, we found a good concordance between the different Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patchy spatial patterns in RTR and CTR, detected by STRUCTURE and GENELAND, were also supported by DAPC and sPCA analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some ambiguity in the individual assignment in STRUCTURE (with prior and without prior) might be due to the presence of a weak population structure [100].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principle component differentiated the RTR population (Cluster 4; see S3a Fig) from the other clusters of CTR and its adjoining FDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinct RTR cluster suggested significant differentiation, but a small overlap of cluster 4 of RTR with CTR might indicate moderate gene flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presence of a weak population structure detected using the Bayesian methods in CTR and its adjoining FDs indicate sufficient genetic exchange between these areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separate DAPC analysis with CTR and adjoining FDs (S3b Fig), indicated that the subdivision in CTR and its adjoining FDs is not very strong.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the weak genetic structure in the habitats of eastern CTR may be attributed to a low level of disturbance (Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GLSI analysis also showed sharper ridges in CTR and the adjoining FDs to the east, indicating that the greatest genetic distances are between CTR and RTR (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detection of first-generation migrants (GENECLASS 2) and asymmetric migration in the last three to five generations (BAYESASS) between CTR and RTR provides evidence of migration between the populations even with this level of disturbance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two migrants and one admixed individual were detected between RTR and CTR, which suggests that the RajajiCorbett corridor is functional but at a low scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAYESASS identified contemporary migration and suggested that there is asymmetric migration from CTR to RTR, with a rate of more than 5% (m = 0.089).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This asymmetric gene flow is characteristic for sourcesink population dynamics, with individuals moving from more stable, higher density populations (CTR) into a neighboring low-density population (RTR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emigrant tigers from CTR to eastern RTR are probably exploring areas of low disturbance in order to settle there.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Harihar et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [37] reported a high turnover of tigers in eastern RTR, determined through camera traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high turnover is probably the result of tigers coming from CTR, as this is the only source population in this landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the high migration from CTR maintains demographic connectivity among the populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Harihar and Pandav [39] indicated that the eastern RTR (Chilla) has a fairly good prey density, but disturbance-free areas are very limited and already have resident tigers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 10 transects surveyed in this area in 2008, only two were disturbance-free, whereas the livestock and human encounter rates were between 25 and 100/km in remaining transects [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies on tigers in other landscapes have also indicated that the presence/occupancy of tigers is relatively high in disturbance-free areas [89].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the significant genetic differentiation in some areas and the presence of a weak population structure in other regions in WTAL can be supported and explained by the human influence, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  human settlement history due to the malaria eradication program and recent anthropogenic and development activities in this tiger landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

43_Human_influence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Asia, the TAL region is one of the most threatened and fragmented landscapes [101], and the history of human habitation can be traced to ancient times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the early 1950s, the TAL was used only by native tribes because of the prevalence of malaria, but after successful eradication of malaria in the 1960s, migrants started entering the terai from different parts of India.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The settlers cleared the TAL forest and used the land for agriculture, as a result of which now only 2% of the natural habitat in this landscape is contiguous [101].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the change in the land use pattern, the forest areas became fragmented patches, especially in the plains [102].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the increased human population in this landscape exerts a variety of pressures on forest resources, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  extracting wood for fuel, collecting fodder and grazing livestock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The increasing human population and its demands and various development-related infrastructure projects have broken the connectivity of the forest in this tiger landscape, as evidenced in night light intensity (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various development activities in the form of industrial setups and the road and rail networks in WTAL started in the 1960s [102].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The natural mixed forest and grassland in Haridwar, Bijnore, Terai West, Terai Central and Terai East FDs (Fig 1) have been converted into monoculture plantations (such as Eucalyptus spp., Ailanthus excelsa, Populus ciliate) to meet industrial needs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Johnsingh and Negi [34] reported that the extinction of the tiger from the Bijnore FD was due to the conversion of natural forest (which was home for prey species, such as the sambar and wild pig) to monoculture plantations and related human disturbances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the survey of the RajajiCorbett corridor (250 km2) in 2000, the authors recorded only three pugmarks of tigers and emphasized the seriousness of the anthropogenic pressure in some parts of this landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Joshi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [103] also reported that in the last decade, movements of wild elephants and tigers have been rare due to the heavy vehicle traffic on the KotdwarLansdowne and KotdwarKalagarh highways (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The township and agricultural lands in Kotdwar severely threaten both of the corridors connecting Rajaji to Corbett, especially Bijnore [88].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies [38, 39] also confirmed that the loss of functionality of the regional corridor has resulted in a decrease in tiger occupancy in eastern RTR and suggested maintaining the RajajiCorbett corridor by eliminating disturbance and facilitating movement between the populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This area is relatively flat and has fewer networks of drainage or rivulets than other areas of this landscape (east of CTR) (Fig 5) and has always been more prone to human encroachment than mountainous terrains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such drainage or rivulets in mountainous terrains provide secluded places to move from one area to another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could have been one of the reasons for the higher gene flow towards the east than the west of CTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several ecological studies carried out in this landscape [32, 36, 38 39] have highlighted the anthropogenic pressure in all connecting corridors in WTAL and have recommended preservation of the RajajiCorbett corridor to sustain the tiger population in RTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent to the relocation of Gujjars from eastern Rajaji (Chilla Range), Harihar et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [37, 38] reported the recovery of three to four tigers in the eastern part and provided a photo of a lactating female with cubs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This recovery was attributed to the movement of tigers from the source population (CTR) through the RajajiCorbett corridor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding of the sibship relationship between Rajaji and Corbett also indicates movement between the two populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though there is no direct genetic confirmation of migration of particular individuals from Corbett to Rajaji, the detection of first-generation migrants, considerable asymmetric migration, and sibship relationships strengthen the proof of the functionality of the corridor and the need to minimize disturbance towards the west of CTR to establish another source population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on prey abundance, Harihar and Pandav [39] estimated that eastern RTR (Chilla) be able to sustain between 11 and 15 tigers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high gene flow and weak population structure between CTR and adjoining FDs (Ramnagar FD, Terai west and Central FDs) support the recommendations of Johnsingh and Negi [34] for a Greater Corbett from the east of the RajaiCorbett corridor to the Boar River (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The priority should be to monitor this Greater Corbett area at least annually with reference to the extent of human disturbance so that timely management initiatives may be taken up to increase the dispersal of tigers across populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
