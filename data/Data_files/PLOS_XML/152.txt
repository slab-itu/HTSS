Factor VIII Is Synthesized in Human Endothelial Cells, Packaged in Weibel-Palade Bodies and Secreted Bound to ULVWF Strings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cellular synthesis site and ensuing storage location for human factor VIII (FVIII), the coagulation protein deficient in hemophilia A, has been elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FVIII stability and half-life is dependent on non-covalent complex formation with von Willebrand factor (VWF) to avoid proteolysis and clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VWF is synthesized in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells, and is stored and secreted from platelet alpha granules and Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper we provide direct evidence for FVIII synthesis in 2 types of primary human endothelial cells: glomerular microvascular endothelial cells (GMVECs) and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression quantified by real time PCR revealed that levels of F8 and VWF are similar in GMVECs and HUVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous clinical studies have shown that stimulation of vasopressin V2 receptors causes parallel secretion of both proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we found that both endothelial cell types express AVPR2 (vasopressin V2 receptor gene) and that AVPR2 mRNA levels are 5-fold higher in GMVECs than HUVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FVIII and VWF proteins were detected by fluorescent microscopy in Weibel-Palade bodies within GMVECs and HUVECs using antibodies proven to be target specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visual presence of FVIII and VWF in Weibel-Palade bodies was confirmed by correlation measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high extent of correlation was compared with negative correlation values obtained from FVIII detection with cytoplasmic proteins, -actin and Factor H. FVIII activity was positive in GMVEC and HUVEC cell lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulated GMVECs and HUVECs were found to secrete cell-anchored ultra-large VWF strings covered with bound FVIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human factor VIII (FVIII) functions as a cofactor for activated factor IX, and mutations in the FVIII gene (F8) result in hemophilia A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1] FVIII in plasma is proteolyzed and/or pinocytosed unless it is protected by non-covalent binding to soluble forms of von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [24]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VWF is synthesized in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells (ECs), and is stored in megakaryocyte/platelet alpha granules and EC Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [5] VWF multimers are secreted from WPBs in ultra-long, hyper-adhesive strings anchored to EC surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Platelets adhere to these secreted/anchored strings and initiate hemostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6,7]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the synthesis of FVIII has been demonstrated in many human tissue types, including liver, spleen, kidney and lymphatic tissue, [810] ECs are the only specific human cell type where direct evidence of FVIII production has been obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FVIII protein or activity levels, either released into culture medium or from cell lysates, have been measured in human liver sinusoidal (LS) ECs, cardiac microvascular (MV) ECs, intestinal MVECs, dermal MVECs, lung MVECs and pulmonary artery ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1114] Positive F8 mRNA expression has been reported for each of these EC types, except intestinal MVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1214] However, because of the variety of ECs, and even after extensive investigation, the precise nature of FVIII synthesis, storage and secretion in ECs remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clinical data showing parallel increases in plasma FVIII and VWF levels in mild hemophilia A patients and Type 1 VWD patients following des-amino-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) administration has lead to speculation that FVIII, in addition to VWF, is stored within human ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1517] Experimental proof of FVIII secretion with DDAVP stimulation has not been reported for unaltered (non-transfected) human ECs (or any other natural non-EC cell type).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transcripts for F8 have been found in murine hepatocytes and LSECs, and cultured murine LSECs release measurable amounts FVIII activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [18] Recently, two articles reported data confirming murine ECs as the exclusive cellular source of FVIII synthesis in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [19,20] These two articles are compatible with the previous human data reported by Shahani, et al., who used receptor-specific cell sorting to isolate LSECs from hepatocytes in liver tissues to show that LSECs are the primary source of FVIII synthesis within the liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [12]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this report, we demonstrate FVIII synthesis in two types of unmodified, primary human ECs: glomerular microvascular endothelial cells (GMVECs) and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) for the first time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FVIII synthesis was confirmed by F8 gene expression, immunofluorescent microscopic FVIII protein detection, and measurements of FVIII activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that FVIII is stored in WPBs along with VWF, in both EC types; and that stimulated GMVECs and HUVECs secrete cell-anchored ultra-large (UL) VWF strings with FVIII bound to them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Relative_Quantitative_Gene_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The gene expression levels of F8 (Entrez Gene ID 2157), VWF (ID 7450), AVPR2 (ID 554) and GAPDH (ID 2597) were measured in GMVECs (1123 days post-seeding), HUVECs (714 days post-seeding), and fibroblasts (67 days post-seeding).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior to RNA extraction, cells were maintained for 24 hours in serum-free medium consisting of M131 with PSQ plus insulin, transferrin and selenium (ITS, Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies), chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA integrity was verified by 260/280 optical density ratios and 1%-agarose-formaldehyde electrophoresis, and was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III Supermix (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples (100 ng cDNA) were amplified in triplicate by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the conditions: 95°C for 3 min, 40 cycles of (10 sec at 95°C, 10 sec at 55°C, 30 sec at 72°C), and 95°C for 10 sec followed by melting curves from 65° to 95°C (CFX96, BioRad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplified products were detected using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (S1 Table) (with 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled probes that span target exon junctions) and Fast Advanced Master Mix (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

FVIII locations and detection intensities within GMVECs and HUVECs were compared with internal detection of VWF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HUVECs, internal detection of FVIII was additionally compared with internal detection of -actin and Factor H. FVIII was compared with these proteins for similarities in shape and location by measuring Pearsons correlation coefficient (PCC) and by graphs of intensity values at specific locations on merged images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior to analysis, the images at 60× and 100× had non-subjective background subtraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_F8_gene_is_expressed_in_GMVECs_and_HUVECs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gene expression levels of F8, VWF and AVPR2 (vasopressin V2 receptor gene) were measured in unstimulated GMVECs, HUVECs and fibroblasts by real-time PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression levels in each cell type were quantified relative to expression levels in GMVECs (Table 1 and S1 Dataset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNA levels for F8 and VWF are similar in GMVECs and HUVECs, whereas levels for AVPR2 are 5-fold higher in GMVECs than in HUVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibroblast expression levels for F8 are 6-fold higher and AVPR2 levels are 3.5-fold higher than levels in GMVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibroblast mRNA levels for VWF are, however, ~20,000-fold lower than VWF message levels in GMVECs and HUVECs (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Threshold cycle numbers are shown in S3 Table and the transcript copy numbers after normalization to GAPDH are in S4 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Specificity_of_antibodies_to_human_FVIII_and_VWF  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar amounts of non-reduced recombinant (r) FVIII protein and reduced purified plasma VWF were analyzed by Western blotting using mouse monoclonal anti-human FVIII and polyclonal rabbit and goat anti-human VWF antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bands for both proteins were visible on Coomassie stained gels (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mouse monoclonal antibody, produced using purified human FVIII as the immunogen, did not detect plasma-purified VWF (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polyclonal anti-VWF antibodies did not detect the rFVIII protein (Fig 1B and 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The schematic drawing in panel (E) shows the generation of the rFVIII bands detected on the Coomassie stained gel and Western blot (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [29]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fluorescent_microscopy_emission_cross-talk_controls  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiments shown in Fig 2 were conducted to verify the absence of fluorescent cross-talk or bleed-through between the channels used to detect and distinguish the proteins in this study by fluorescent microscopy: 488 nm (green) and 647 nm (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images of HUVECs internally stained only with rabbit anti-VWF + chicken anti-rabbit IgG AF-488 (green, Fig 2A) acquired using 647-channel filters did not show detectable 647 fluorescence (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HUVECs stained only with rabbit anti-VWF + chicken anti-rabbit IgG AF-647 (red, Fig 2D) acquired using 488-channel filters did not show any 488 fluorescence signal (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FVIII_and_VWF_proteins_are_present_in_WPBs_of_GMVECs_and_HUVECs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Internal staining of unstimulated GMVECs and HUVECs, using target-specific antibodies (Fig 1), demonstrates the presence of FVIII and VWF in WPBs (Fig 3 and S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FVIII and VWF were distinctly identified by using mono-specific primary antibodies combined with secondary detection antibodies with widely separated wavelengths for excitation and emission, as shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [24,26] GMVECs and HUVECs stained with secondary detection antibodies alone showed only background fluorescence (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FVIII_and_VWF_proteins_are_absent_in_fibroblasts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to GMVECs and HUVECs, FVIII and VWF proteins were not detected by fluorescent microscopy in fibroblasts (Fig 4A4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fibroblasts appeared to stain positively for VWF when the chicken anti-rabbit IgG-488 was used as the secondary detection antibody (Fig 4E and 4F), and negatively for VWF with chicken anti-rabbit IgG-647 as the secondary detection antibody (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity measurements of full image areas of the fibroblasts were made after cell staining using each secondary detection antibody and in the presence or absence of primary antibodies to VWF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity measurements showed that images of fibroblasts incubated with secondary IgG-488 antibodies alone had almost 2-fold higher fluorescent intensity than images of fibroblasts detected with the primary antibody to VWF plus secondary IgG-488 antibodies (S5 Table and S7 Dataset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibroblasts stained with secondary mouse antibodies alone also showed equal or higher amounts of fluorescent staining than fibroblasts stained with the primary mouse anti-FVIII plus these secondary detection antibodies (Fig 4D and 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Colocalization_of_FVIII_and_VWF_in_WPBs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Values for Pearsons correlation coefficient (PCC) were calculated from merged fluorescent microscopy images of GMVECs and HUVECs with concurrent internal FVIII and internal VWF detection (Table 2, Fig 5 and S2 Dataset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean PCC values (0.770.79) resulting from FVIII and VWF detection in HUVEC and GMVEC images indicate: a correlation in location (WPBs); and a distribution of FVIII and VWF in proportional amounts within both types of ECs (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity scatter plots, shown for representative images of FVIII and VWF in WPBs of GMVECs and HUVECs, show singular linear relationships (Fig 5C, 5D, 5G and 5H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FVIII_detection_in_WPBs_does_not_overlap_with_detection_of_cytoplasmic_proteins__-actin_or_Factor_H  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorescent images of HUVECs with simultaneous detection of FVIII and either -actin or Factor H, produced PCC values that were below the values for correlation (Table 3, Fig 6 and S2 Dataset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean PCC values for -actin (0.35 and 0.38) and Factor H (0.42 and 0.44) indicate that detection signals for these two proteins are not spatially correlated with FVIII detection signals in HUVECs (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity scatter plots display separate populations and the merged fluorescent images do not show FVIII in overlapping locations with -actin or Factor H (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intensity_signals_for_FVIII_and_VWF_in_WPBs_are_synchronized  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intensities were measured from merged fluorescent images of FVIII and VWF along lines traversing WPBs in internally stained HUVECs (Fig 7A7D) and GMVECs (Fig 7E7H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity graphs of FVIII detection (red) and VWF detection (green) at the same locations demonstrate that the signals coincide (Fig 7 and S3 Dataset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intensity_signals_of_FVIII_in_WPBs_are_not_synchronized_with_intensities_of_the_cytoplasmic_proteins_-actin_or_Factor_H  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Contrary to FVIII and VWF detection, intensities measured along lines spanning WPBs in HUVECs internally stained with FVIII and concurrently with -actin (Fig 8A8D) or with Factor H (Fig 8E8H) showed that the signals do not coincide (S4 Dataset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FVIII_is_secreted_from_stimulated_GMVECs_and_HUVECs_bound_to_ULVWF_strings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GMVECs and HUVECs stimulated with histamine resulted in WPB secretion from the two types of ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EC-secreted and anchored ULVWF strings had bound FVIII (GMVECs Fig 9 and HUVECs Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only possible source of this bound FVIII in these experiments was the EC WPB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity measurements made along the secreted/anchored ULVWF strings from merged images demonstrate both FVIII and VWF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity ratios of FVIII to VWF determined that ULVWF strings secreted by GMVECs have ~2-fold more FVIII attached than the strings secreted from HUVECs (Table 4, S5 and S6 Datasets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to stimulated ECs, there was only light detection of FVIII and VWF on surfaces of unstimulated HUVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (The HUVECs were perturbed only mechanically in washing steps.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies against FVIII and VWF detected only small amounts of surface FVIII and VWF in non-overlapping locations (S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Internal_FVIII_activity_in_GMVECs_and_HUVECs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Internal FVIII activity was measured in the supernatants of GMVEC lysates and HUVEC lysates using a modified chromogenic FVIII activity assay (Table 5 and S8 Dataset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specificity of the FVIII assay was verified by the reduced activity in rFVIII dilutions with addition of inhibitory FVIII antibodies (S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional confirmation was shown by parallel reductions in FVIII activity values resulting from dilutions of EC lysates (S4 Fig and S8 Dataset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we measured the relative gene expression of F8 and VWF, using real-time PCR, in two types of primary human ECs, GMVECs and HUVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the first report of F8 gene analysis in GMVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our results contradict several previous studies that specifically reported the lack of F8 gene expression in HUVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a different experimental system, a microarray expression BeadChip, Dashty, et al., studied the gene expression of multiple coagulation factors in eight human primary cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [32] These included mesenchymal stem cells, hepatocytes, adipocytes, preadipocytes, monocytes, macrophages, HUVECs and dermal fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These authors reported that HUVECs did not express mRNA for F8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the other cell types (including dermal fibroblasts) were reported to express similar levels of the F8 gene (~30-fold higher than HUVEC levels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HUVEC F8 gene levels may have been below the threshold for positive detection in their system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider this likely because the findings by Dashty, et al., are not consistent with our findings (using real-time PCR) that the F8 mRNA levels were expressed in the same order of magnitude in HUVECs, GMVECs and fibroblasts (S4 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We question the interpretation of the BeadChip analysis used by Dashy, et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  because they reported VWF gene expression, known to be present only in megakaryocytes, platelets and ECs, to be positive in every cell type used in their study (with the exception of adipocytes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in our experiments, VWF expression levels in fibroblasts were 10,000-fold lower than VWF gene expression in HUVECs or GMVECs (S4 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In an article, by Shahani, et al., F8 gene expression was measured in HCMECs and HUVECs and, using real time PCR, quantified relative to the F8 gene levels in their F8-transfected CHO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [13] The F8 levels in their HCMECs were 93-fold higher that the F8-transfected CHO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HUVEC F8 gene levels were 0-fold higher, apparently indicating that HUVECs expressed the same amount of F8 mRNA as their F8-transfected CHO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene levels were evaluated using the 2CT method (and 20 = 1); therefore, the HUVECs and the F8-transfected CHO cells produced equal amounts of F8 mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shahani, et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  concluded, however, that F8 gene expression was not detected in HUVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a separate study by Shovlin, et al., their presentation of F8 gene expression in cultured HUVECs is difficult to interpret.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [14] In addition to the known F8 transcripts variants 1 and 2, these authors detected two previously unknown F8 mRNA transcripts (designated as variants 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcripts for F8 variants 1 or 2 were detected, by PCR cDNA gel analysis and sequencing, in each cultured EC type tested: human pulmonary (HP) arterial ECs, HP microvascular ECs, HDMECs and HUVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their HUVECs were also positive for F8 mRNA variant 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the authors showed a gel of HUVEC cDNA clearly positive for 2 out of 4 of the F8 mRNA transcripts studied, they used HUVECs as negative controls for FVIII antigen measurements and surface detection in flow cytometer experiments, and concluded that in their hands, HUVECs were not a good source of FVIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In two separate studies, the shapes of WPBs were examined in ECs transfected with the human F8 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [33,34] In the 2009 study, by van den Biggelaar, et al., HUVECs transfected either with untagged or with F8-yellow-fluorescent-protein (YFP) were examined by fluorescent microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [34] The untagged FVIII protein was detected using a monoclonal antibody to FVIII plus fluorescently tagged secondary antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These authors found that HUVEC WPBs were in the usually observed elongated shape in the absence of F8 gene transfection, and spherical in shape with either untagged F8 or F8-YFP transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  van den Biggelaar, et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  concluded that endogenous FVIII production could interfere with normal folding of VWF into tubular forms; however, it was not determined what levels of FVIII production would have this effect on the WPBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 2011 study, Bouwens, et al., transfected blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) with F8-green-FP (GFP), and analyzed WPB shape and structure using correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [33] The authors made detailed length and width measurements of FVIII positive and FVIII negative WPBs, and concluded that WPBs containing FVIII had diameters 1.5-fold larger than WPBs without FVIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also concluded that the observed structural changes in the WPBs of the F8-transfected BOECs might be due to over expression of FVIII protein in these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using fluorescent microscopy, in the current study, we showed that FVIII was stored together with VWF in GMVEC and HUVEC WPBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their concomitant location in WPBs was confirmed by three means: direct visual evidence in merged fluorescent images; synchronized signal detection for both proteins across merged WPB images; and calculated correlation coefficients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recently published article, we also used fluorescent microscopy and correlation coefficient measurements to establish that Factor H and Factor I are not located in WPBs of GMVECs and HUVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [35]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our current methods for detection of FVIII in HUVEC (and GMVEC) WPBs, is possible, in comparison to studies of cellular FVIII in in the 80s and 90s, because of advances in microscopy, detection sensitivity, and availability of monoclonal antibodies against FVIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our current detection methods also differ from other contemporary studies of FVIII synthesis in cultured ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1114] For example, the study conducted by Shahani, et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in 2010, employed laboratory methods that were similar to the methods we used in this report, except with crucial differences, to detect internal FVIII protein, measure cell-released and cell lysate FVIII activity, and F8 gene expression levels in primary cultured human ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [13] As mentioned above in the third paragraph of the Discussion, Shahani, et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  found that HUVEC F8 gene levels were about 100-fold lower than the F8 gene levels in HCMECs, and were equal to levels in their F8-transfected CHO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although HCMEC gene levels of F8 could possibly be 100-fold higher than those in HUVECs, there are several potential technical reasons that may account for their results: RNA was extracted from a relatively small number of ECs grown in 6-well plates (with growth areas of 9.6 cm2); RNA quality and quantity were not verified by gel analysis; results were based on a single RNA extraction per cell type; and PCR primers were designed in their laboratory (in contrast to our commercially tested and guaranteed TaqMan probes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our studies, we used TaqMan probes and RNA was extracted 47 times from each EC type (or fibroblasts) grown in T-75 flasks (with growth areas of 75 cm2 and ~7-fold more cells than in the experiments of Shahani, et al.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we extracted RNA from ECs when the majority of cells were fully mature, but not overgrown (HUVECs: 714 days post-seeding; and GMVECs: 1123 days post-seeding).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified RNA by optical density, RNA integrity was verified by gel analysis, and gene expression levels were measured in triplicate from 37 PCR runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression levels for F8 were calculated relative to expression levels in GMVECs, a natural cell type, instead of the non-standardized laboratory transfected cell line used by Shahani, et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [13]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As in our study, Shahani, et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  used monoclonal antibodies directed against FVIII and polyclonal antibodies against VWF, combined with fluorescent secondary antibodies, to detect internal FVIII in cultured ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [13] Their images of HUVECs co-stained for FVIII and VWF showed no detectable FVIII; however the fluorescence detection of VWF in WPBs was also low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several differences between their staining method and ours are likely to contribute to the low fluorescent signals in their images: their ECs were grown, stained and imaged on chamber slides, and the thicker glass compromises fluorescent signals; and, although their ECs were stained after reaching confluence, the number of days post-confluence was not stated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is, therefore, the possibility that their ECs were immature and not capable of packaging WPBs with FVIII and VWF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another problem with the studies of Shahani, et al., may be the length of time between staining and imaging of the ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their cells were stained and then stored for an unstated time at negative 20°C until imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent signals decrease over time, even if slides are stored in the dark at low temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [13] In contrast, in our study cells were grown, stained and imaged on 1-mm thick coverslips; stained no earlier than 6 days after seeding; and imaged on the same day as staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we include experiments specifically designed to demonstrate that fluorescent detection antibodies did not cause any bleed-through or cross-talk in our microscopic system, and provide control images of each cell type stained with secondary antibodies alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stimulation of GMVECs and HUVECs causes WPB secretion, and we found that the secreted/anchored ULVWF strings were bound with FVIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measured intensities of these proteins revealed that the GMVEC-secreted ULVWF strings carried more FVIII than the HUVEC-secreted ULVWF strings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation of FVIII bound to EC-secreted ULVWF strings has been previously reported by Bouwens, et al., using blood outgrowth ECs transfected with F8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F8-transfected ECs produced F8/ULVWF strings with an unexpected characteristic; a decrease in the ability of the F8/ULVWF strings to bind platelets compared to the un-transfected outgrowth ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of the platelet adhesive capacity of these F8/ULVWF strings was attributed to a steric hindrance affect from FVIII binding nearby to platelet binding sites within A1 domains of VWF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [33] This explanation for their observation is unlikely because ULVWF strings secreted from normal GMVECs and HUVECs [36] actively bind platelets and are naturally bound with FVIII, as we show in the current study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VWF multimers are produced, stored and secreted in long, hyper-adhesive strings bound with FVIII from endothelial cell WPBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These FVIII bound VWF multimeric strings are transiently anchored to EC surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ADAMTS-13, the VWF cleaving protease, cleaves the anchored VWF strings into smaller, soluble forms that bind FVIII and prolong FVIII survival in the circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [22]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
V2 receptors must be present on EC surfaces in order for cyclic AMP-mediated signaling to induce FVIII and VWF secretion in response to DDAVP administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [37,38] Transcripts for the vasopressin V2 receptor gene, AVPR2, have been found in human lung MVECs and in other EC-containing tissues, although not in HUVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [38,39] In one of these previous reports, HUVECs transfected with AVPR2 were shown to secrete measurable amounts of VWF after combined stimulation of DDAVP plus the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [39] We also measured relative levels of AVPR2 in addition to the gene expression of F8 and VWF in GMVECs and HUVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ECs expressed low levels of AVPR2 (S1 and S2 Tables), probably leading to the presence of some V2 receptors on their (and fibroblast) surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we found that fibroblasts have higher F8 mRNA transcript levels than GMVECs and HUVECs, (and very low levels of VWF), although neither FVIII protein nor VWF protein was detected by fluorescent microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells unable to synthesize sufficient amounts of VWF do not form WPBs, and only a few cell lines transfected with VWF have been shown to store the induced VWF into organelles resembling WPBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [40,41] Furthermore, non-VWF producing cells transfected with F8 do not store FVIII protein nor form WPBs, whereas HUVECs transfected with the F8 gene have been shown to produce and store FVIII in WPBs with native VWF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [42,43] Rosenberg et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  has also demonstrated that only cells doubly transfected with genes for F8 and VWF results in the storage of both proteins in WPBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [43] This finding is analogous to the FVIII/VWF production in Type 3 VWD, when the near absence of VWF protein also results in a near absence of FVIII protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A sensitive and widely used method of measuring the low levels of FVIII activity in cultured cells uses a chromogenic substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1013,44] The chromogenic substrate is cleaved into a detectable colored product by activated FXa, which is generated from FX by FIXa in complex with FVIII (the limiting factor that is measured).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FXa generated and the intensity of the cleaved substrate is, therefore, proportional to the FVIII available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [32] Shahani, et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  did not detect FVIII activity in cell lysates of HUVECs grown in 96-well plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in our study we increased the ratio of cells to the volume of lysis buffer, and modified the chromogenic assay to accommodate a larger sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these alterations, we were able to measure FVIII activity in HUVEC lysates, as well as in GMVEC lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results demonstrate that stimulated GMVECs and HUVECs secrete cell-anchored ULVWF multimeric strings covered with bound FVIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no established method to quantify EC-secreted FVIII activity that is attached to ULVWF strings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, under our experimental conditions, ADAMTS-13 (also released from ECs) cleaves EC-anchored ULVWF strings; but it is not known if string-bound FVIII remains attached to smaller VWF cleavage products, dissociates from cleaved VWF forms, becomes free in solution, or binds to EC surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to avoid these complicating and enigmatic issues in the current study, we measured FVIII activity in the cell lysates of PBS-washed GMVECs and HUVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of EC lysates also avoided any inclusion of exogenous bovine FVIII activity from culture medium supplements in our measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, our data provides new information about human FVIII and VWF obtained by using two types of human, unmodified ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genetically unaltered GMVECs and HUVECs have transcripts for both F8 and VWF, produce both FVIII and VWF proteins, store both proteins together in WPB organelles, and secrete them both in response to EC stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new information, which supports previous reports in human cultured ECs [1113] and more recent findings in mice, [19,20] may lead to improved therapy for hemophilia A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recognition that FVIII is normally synthesized in human ECs and stored in their WPBs for regulated secretion (along with VWF) indicates that these organelles may ultimately become the precise, most effective physiological targets for human F8 gene delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
