Reconstruction of the socio-semantic dynamics of political activist Twitter networksMethod and application to the 2017 French presidential election  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Background  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Digital spaces, and in particular social networking sites, are becoming increasingly present and influential in the functioning of our democracies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we propose an integrated methodology for the data collection, the reconstruction, the analysis and the visualization of the development of a countrys political landscape from Twitter data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Method  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The proposed method relies solely on the interactions between Twitter accounts and is independent of the characteristics of the shared contents such as the language of the tweets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validate our methodology on a case study on the 2017 French presidential election (60 million Twitter exchanges between more than 2.4 million users) via two independent methods: the comparison between our automated political categorization and a human categorization based on the evaluation of a sample of 5000 profiles descriptions; the correspondence between the reconfigurations detected in the reconstructed political landscape and key political events reported in the media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter validation demonstrated the ability of our approach to accurately reflect the reconfigurations at play in the off-line political scene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We built on this reconstruction to give insights into the opinion dynamics and the reconfigurations of political communities at play during a presidential election.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we propose a quantitative description and analysis of the political engagement of members of political communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we analyze the impact of political communities on information diffusion and in particular on their role in the fake news phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measure a differential echo chamber effect on the different types of political news (fake news, debunks, standard news) caused by the community structure and emphasize the importance of addressing the meso-structures of political networks in understanding the fake news phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Giving access to an intermediate level, between sociological surveys in the field and large statistical studies (such as those conducted by national or international organizations) we demonstrate that social networks data make it possible to qualify and quantify the activity of political communities in a multi-polar political environment; as well as their temporal evolution and reconfiguration, their structure, their alliance strategies and their semantic particularities during a presidential campaign through the analysis of their digital traces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude this paper with a comment on the political and ethical implications of the use of social networks data in politics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We stress the importance of developing social macroscopes that will enable citizens to better understand how they collectively make society and propose as example the Politoscope, a macroscope that delivers some of our results in an interactive way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Digital spaces are becoming increasingly present and influential in the functioning of our democracies, to the point where events transpiring in these spaces can no longer be ignored when it comes to analyzing trends in the political environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the wake of each of the major political upheavals that have shaken western democracies in recent months (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brexit, the election of Trump), commentators have turned to the social networking sites in the search for a better understanding of these events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the space of a few years, the use of social networking sites has become fully integrated into the strategies of political parties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Barack Obama was qualified as a game changer in 2012, when he became the first presidential candidate to make massive use of social networking sites for his campaign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2016 presidential campaign in the USA confirmed this trend, with an estimated total budget of around 500M  devoted to the use of social networking sites [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
France followed the same trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nowadays, the largest political parties call on the services of specialized companies, in order to gain a better understanding of their potential voters, through the analysis of very large volumes of data provided by social networking sites [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these, Twitter is very well ranked among accessible sources of information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it is the social networking site used by the majority of political figures, in response to current affairs or to provide visibility for their opinions and public statements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This social networking site has thus become an unavoidable medium for the political world, when it comes to delivering messages or establishing legitimacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the objective of evaluating the potential of platforms like Twitter for research on social dynamics, and particularly in political sciences, we propose a method in the framework of complex networks analysis allowing the political communities and their evolution in a multi-polar political environment to be reconstructed and analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a case study, we implement and evaluate this method on data we have collected during the 2017 French presidential elections that feature almost 60 million Twitter exchanges between more than 2.4 million users (Politoscope projecthttps://politoscope.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unusual hectic nature of these elections (see Text A in S1 File for a summary) represents a worse case scenario for this kind of reconstruction and guaranties the robustness of our approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then present some perspectives this type of reconstruction brings to social sciences and discuss its relevance for political sciences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Related_work  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A considerable volume of academic literature has been devoted to Twitter, as this platform benefits from two different advantages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its content is massively duplicated by the traditional press or television and it is accessible to the general public, even though it may not be representative of the global or even Frances population [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, data collection is relatively straightforward, thanks to various APIs proposed by Twitter (https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Numerous methodologies can be used to access Twitter productions, in the context of the study of political activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some specific methods [46] are designed to take advantage of the content of tweets to infer the political orientation of a tweet or user.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the constraints associated with tweet formats appear to limit the efficiency of these methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, according to Cohen and Ruths [7], the hashtags used to discuss policy do not discriminate against types of political activism for people with low levels of activism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In an effort to avoid the problems associated with automatic language processing, research has been channeled towards methods that analyze the structure, rather than the content, of exchanges made on Twitter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have thus been inspired by a pioneering study of political blogs made in the USA [8], which has shown that there are more links between two blogs if they express the same political views.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the framework of Twitter, there are several possible definitions for the relationship between two accounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An account can follow or mention another account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can answer, cite, comment or simply relay (retweet) a tweet from another account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these notions of a link are significant, and depend on the objectives of the study [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in order to rank accounts according to their political orientation, it appears that the use of retweets is the most commonly used definition for a link between two accounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, Garimella et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10] and Connover et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6] have observed that in order to study political debates on Twitter, the use of retweets is more relevant than Twitter mentions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Connover et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6] were among the first to take advantage of retweets in a study of the structure of the political environment in the USA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They retrieved its bipartisan nature, and showed that there are significantly less retweets between two accounts when they belong to different parties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, numerous other studies have made use of this type of relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boutet et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [11] (resp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larsson and Moe [12]) applied the same method to study the structure of the political space in England (resp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sweden), and to analyze differences in practice, in terms of the manner in which political groups use Twitter mentions, hashtags and Internet links.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Garimella et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10] and Morales et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [13] used the notion of retweets to measure the existence of polarization and controversies on Twitter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amor et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [14] used this to characterize the debate on care.data of the English National Health System and Guerrero et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [15] also used this approach to study the Catalan Process Toward Independence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These techniques have made it possible to retrieve bipolar political structures, although the notion of retweets also makes it possible to retrieve multi-polar structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was the case with Cherepnalkoski et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16, 17], who used retweets to determine the political affiliation of the Members of the European Parliament (MEP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these authors note that it is difficult to generalize this method, because in addition to their political connections, MEPs also have national preferences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The retweet is not the only usable relationship that can characterize the structure of a political environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The research of Barberá [18] made use of follower/followee relationships between accounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The originality of their research is that of assigning a position, between -1 and +1 on a left-right ideological axis, to each account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an account is not assigned to the Democrats (resp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Republicans) party, but to a position close to other members of the Democrats (resp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Republicans).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach makes it possible to compare a set of accounts over an ideological continuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were successfully reproduced using Twitter data in France by Briatte and Gallic [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using their ideological estimation technique, Barberá et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [20] have also shown that there is a strong degree of retweet polarization when a political subject is mentioned, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  that there is a high number of retweets between ideologically close, and a low number between ideologically distant, accounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, it is important to note that despite the publication of numerous studies evaluating ideological alignments, one of the aims of political science, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  that of predicting voting intentions, remains problematic [21], in particular as a consequence of the imperfect representativeness of Twitter with respect to the real population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In just a few years, Twitter has thus become a productive research domain for social sciences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it has certain limitations in terms of the types of population that can be correctly studied, it is noteworthy that there have been a huge increase of Twitter use in the last few years with more than 15M active users in France in 2017 [22] (France population in 2017 was 66.9M) and an estimated number of active users that has tripled worldwide since the first studies in 2011 [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, it can be expected that some limitations that have been noted in previous papers might now be mitigated and new results could be obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present paper, we reappraise the aforementioned retweet analysis techniques and we improve them to handle temporal and multipolar analyses, by applying them to a corpus generated by political activists over a period of nearly one year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also combine two Twitter scrapping techniques (following accounts and following keywords) that have usually been used separately, leading to a Twitter corpora of very high quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The extend of the tweets collection and the prolonged period of study combined with an improved methodology and new analytics have, for one of the first times, made it possible to study the socio-semantic dynamics of a multi-polar political environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the CNRS Multivac platform (http://multivac.iscpif.fr), a platform dedicated to stream data capture and analysis, to capture in real-time the political twittosphere activity in France.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a period of 11 months prior to the presidential election, we continuously collected almost 60 million tweets concerning more than three thousands of the key French political figures and few dozens political keywords, that were used by more than 2.4 million individual accounts (see Text B in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to this set of data as .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All data was collected according to Twitters terms of service and privacy conditions and are made available according to the terms of use of Twitter [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All anonymized data derived from the analysis of this database in the context of this paper are available for download [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated the proportion of tweets in  sent by bots to be less than 5% (see Text C in S1 File), thus ensuring that our results remain representative of online political activism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Retrospectively, given the unusual hectic nature of these elections (see Text A of S1 File for a summary) that took place in a multi-polar political environment, this dataset was found to be both of great interest to understand the French political landscape and of high value to challenge community reconstruction methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_political_communities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_the_themes_of_the_2017_presidential_campaign  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further characterize the political communities, that have been reconstructed solely from social interactions, we have analyzed their semantic profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our objective is not to characterize them in an exhaustive manner, but to provide a preliminary overview of how communities differ in their political agenda and framing of the societal issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For this purpose, we have carried out an analysis of the political discourse in order to extract the main debates of this campaign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was done using two types of sources: policy measures reported in campaign programs, written in developed language, and candidate tweets, written in frequently spoken language.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the analysis of candidates programs we first contacted, on 1 March 2017, all the campaign teams that were about to achieve to collect the 500 signatures from French mayors required to be able to become an official candidate (the Constitutional Council published the official list of candidates only on 20 March 2017).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We invited them to provide us with their program elements and key expressions that they would consider characteristic of their program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unsurprisingly, we had almost no response, only the team of a small candidate indicated to us that given the size of the campaign team, they were not sure they could participate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used then the programs of the eleven candidates downloaded from their websites (between February 14 and March 24, 2017) from which we manually extracted 980 policy measures (see File A2 at DOI: 10.7910/DVN/AOGUIA for an editable version of these policy measures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To complement this corpus, we extracted from the Politoscope database 25, 883 tweets published by the eleven candidates and few other key political figures between August 2016 and January 2017 (see Text B in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This second corpus has the advantage of highlighting the themes that emerged during the political debates, independently of the candidates programmatic orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are two categories of mainstream methods for the extraction of topics from unstructured text: co-word analysis [43] and topic modeling with LDA like methods [44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these approaches, topics are defined as bags of words, inferred from the statistics of appearance of a list of predefined keywords the documents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This list is itself obtained through more or less advanced text-mining methods within the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been demonstrated that LDA has some limitations on analyzing short documents [45] or corpora of small size [46], which are two constraints present in our Twitter corpora (short text messages) and political measures corpora (less than 1000 documents).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consequently, we analyzed these two corpora using the CNRS text-mining software Gargantext (https://gargantext.org; open source at https://github.com/ISCPIF/gargantext), that implements advanced NLP methods and co-word topic detection; as well as visual analytics methods for the representation and interaction with the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first few steps, Gargantext uses a combination of lemmatization, post-tagging and statistical analysis like tf-idf [47] and genericity/specificity analysis [48] to identify from the text-mining few thousand groups of keywords that are specific to the political discourse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These keywords were further screened by the authors in order to select the most meaningful ones (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  stop words or poorly formed expressions that would have passed the text-mining steps have been removed, important hashtags or neologisms from Twitter like frexit have been added).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, we carefully read all the political measures with the selected keywords highlighted in the text in order to check that no important keyword was missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led to a vocabulary of nearly 1600 groups of keywords qualifying the themes of the presidential campaign (see Text I in S1 File for the list of keywords).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the confidence proximity measure to assess the thematic proximity between the selected terms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The confidence measure is the maximum between two conditional probabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If P(x|y) is the probability that a document mentions term x knowing that it already mentions term y, the confidence is defined by max(P(x|y), P(y|x)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been demonstrated to be one of the best choices to automatically induce general-specific noun relations from web corpora frequency counts [49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We applied the Louvain algorithm [35] to identify groups of terms delineating topics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, we generated the topic map for each of these two corpora (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 for the map from the 2017 presidential programs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these processing steps are part of the Gargantext workflow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We relied on these maps to select eleven topics that we identified as particularly important and representative of the debates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Validation_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to validate our reconstruction method, we have manually verified the political categorization on Monday 6 February (communities computed over the activity period Monday 23 JanuarySunday 5 February 2017) for all active followed accounts (2,440) and a sample of 2,500 active random accounts that day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This period corresponds to the end of the primary of the right, before any changes in the political landscape due to some alliances between candidates (ecologists/Jadot with socialists/Hamon); center/Bayrou with En Marche/Macron, DLF/Dupont-Aignan with FN/Le Pen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For these two samples, we have extracted the Twitter meta-data of the accounts and we have manually coded the accounts political affiliation each times there was a clear support or a declaration of party membership in the account profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We associated all the main political leaders with a reference party using the correspondence in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the account descriptions, some account holders were referring to parties that hadnt any candidates running for this election.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discarded the mentions that correspond to parties that had not clearly rallied any running candidate (PCF and Parti Progressiste among the most mentionned).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We considered as equivalent to France Insoumise (FI) all the parties that were in the former Mélenchons Front de Gauche coalition (before he decided to run for the presidency and created the France Insoumise).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the official declarations of the UDI party [51] we also considered the UDI (Union des Démocrates Indépendants) as supporting Les Républicains (LR) as of Feb. 06 2018, although this position it was clearly not unanimous since few weeks later, a dozen UDI elected officials rallied Macron [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This manual analysis resulted in two distinct lists of 885 followed accounts and 414 random accounts respectively that were publicly supporting one of the 11 running candidates at the time of the community reconstruction (other accounts in the samples did not give enough information in their profile to identify political affiliation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then compared the automatic categorization made on that period with this manual coding to assess the precision and recall of our algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We limited this comparison to accounts that have made at least 10 tweets over the 14 days period of observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we could expect a selection bias due to the fact that the most politically engaged people are both more likely to declare a political affiliation in their Twitter profile and are more easily categorized through automated methods, we consider this as a reasonable limitation to the precision of our estimations of our reconstruction accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should also be emphasized that there is no ground truth regarding political affiliations since at any time, a significant proportion of the population is undecided or is changing its opinion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There will thus always be an intrinsinc uncertainty in the categorisation of accounts whatever the methodology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To complement this validation, we compared the key reconfigurations highlighted in the landscape reconstruction with major news events (see the Results section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Precision_and_recall_of_the_political_landscape_reconstruction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The comparison between the two categorizations revealed a very good fit between the automatic categorization and the manual coding of political affiliations: a precision above 93% for both samples and a recall above 63% for both samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 show the recall, the precision and the confidence intervals for each political party and sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The precision and recall are similar between political parties and samples with two exceptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The FN (extreme right) has a higher recall for the followed accounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that FN supporters express online their political opinions more strongly than any other supporters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The EM party (Macons new party) has a very small precision for the followed sample (7.14% vs. an average of 93.54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that these accounts did not mention their support to EM in their profile but their on-line behavior could be analyzed as relaying pro-Macron information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the list of followed accounts was based on the political figures elected before the creation of the En Marche movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of the sample capture (01/23-06/02 2018) Macrons movement what at its beginning and was gaining momentum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It started recruiting support from other parties supporters but apparently not to the point that these supports would openly express their opinion in their Twitter profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evolution_of_political_communities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another external validation of our approach comes from its ability to follow with great temporal accuracy the changes in the French political landscape that have been reported in the media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Opinions and political communities vary together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Political campaigns involve reversals, bombshells, and reconfigurations of political support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Commentators do their best to anticipate and analyze these changes, whereas the political parties strive to mask what is going on behind the scenes, in order to catch their adversaries off guard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main result of our study is that the automatic analysis of retweet patterns is able to measure, sometimes before the media can make any announcement, the changes taking place inside political communities in response to these events and, in some cases, in response to anticipated events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These changes can be of large magnitude in a very short period of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the comparison between the 3communities political landscape of the two weeks before the first round (Fig 4) and the landscape of the two weeks between the first and second round (Fig 5) shows a complete reorganization of the communities, some being torn apart in the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In an effort to monitor political community reconfigurations over periods of time, when changes are perceptible, we compared the communities pairwise, over consecutive intervals of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach allows transformations in the political communities to be followed without interruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Between each period, for each community, we computed the number of community-changing accounts, and generated the global structure synthesizing the development of the political landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure can be visualized with an alluvial diagram (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6), a visualization that summarizes the reconfigurations of the political space over a period of 11 months, with sufficient resolution to provide an accurate narrative of this presidential election (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen that whereas most of the major political events can be interpreted on this view, it also shows more subtle relationships between communities that are not the subject of official declarations as is the case for rallies or victories in primaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example (see analysis below), we can observe the distancing of the Sarkozy community from that of Fillon, shortly before the Penelopegate affair, followed by the rallying of a considerable number of Sarkozy activists to Dupont-Aignan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This last rally was relatively ephemeral, since most of these accounts ceased to follow Dupont-Aignan when he himself rallied to Le Pen between the two rounds of elections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The many episodes that can be described by this alluvial visualization are all evidences that an analysis of Twitter political tweets can successfully reconstruct the political landscape dynamics: key events of the presidential campaign correspond to key elements in the reconstruction, and thus in the visualization (like merge or split of communities, abrupt change in community size, etc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among others, the following events can easily be identified as merge [M], split [S], emergence [E], fade-out [F] or abrupt size change [C] of some of the communities and associated to press coverages (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 7 where each of the following event has been identified):  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyze these key events in more detail in Figs 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reconstruction method we propose reveals the deep reconfigurations of a political landscape during a presidential campaign in multi-polar political environment like the French one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By describing the behavior of a set of activists, corresponding to a wide spectrum of political affiliations, it is positioned at an intermediate level between political leaders and their electoral base.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It provides access to a level of observation that is rarely accessible in the framework of sociological studies or in political sciences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, between Aug 1st 2016 and May 8 2017, nearly 190,000 individual accounts have been associated to a political community, with most communities involving several tens of thousands of activists (see Table C in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These communities are made up from a large number of opinion leaders and political outlets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these results, we can safely assume that the political tribulations of sub-populations within this set of individuals are indicators, and in some instance the precursors, of political change and reconfiguration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the following sections, we propose insights and open questions about what can be learned from such reconstructions beside the accurate and synthetic narrative of a political campaign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explore two distinct feature of communities: their social structure and their semantic profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_communities_structure_and_political_engagement  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Social systems are among the most sophisticated complex systems in terms of entanglement of levels and multi-scale dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We should consequently expect their multi-level structure to be a key factor in the diffusion phenomena, social networks being a privileged place to observe their role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this section, we look at how communities act on the dissemination and circulation of political information, defending certain themes or highlighting certain topics with a specific framing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particular attention is paid to the phenomenon of fake news which can be studied here in all its community dimension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have demonstrated that methods involving the analysis of exchanges of political content on social networking sites such as Twitter allow automatic reconstruction of political communities which, by their semantic profile and patterns of development, provide deep insights into the dynamics at play inside the space of political activists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By applying these methods to data from the 2017 French presidential election, we reconstructed with a high accuracy the multi-polar French political space, retrieved the main events which occurred during the campaign, and revealed the multiple reconfigurations of political communities, some of which took place under relatively confidential circumstances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using interaction data only, our approach has the advantage of being independent from the language used during these exchanges, provided the studied social activity involves a certain level of commitment from the participants, as it is the case in politics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After checking the accuracy of this reconstruction, we demonstrated how this approach can help to better characterize online political communities, both from the perspective of their structure and from point of view of the kind of information they propagate, fake news included:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a consequence of its 11-months duration, its temporal resolution (real-time capture of data, once every second), and its scale (2.4 million Twitter accounts of which 180, 000 had a sufficient degree of interaction with the Politoscope to be cataloged into a political community), this study establishes the basis for a series of analyzes providing unprecedented insight into opinion dynamics and the reconfiguration of political communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It provides access to an intermediate level of resolution between sociological surveys in the field and global statistical studies (such as those conducted by national census agencies), from which we expect that, in the future, it will represent a major source of political and sociological knowledge supplementing the more traditional approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conclude this paper with a comment concerning the political and ethical implications of the development of these methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, the boundary between private and public life has become increasingly thin, as the digital trails left by citizens have been systematically analyzed, by combining an ever increasing number of databases (purchase history, web navigation history, votes, store loyalty cards, public transport, GPS location, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), and by considering an increasingly significant history based on population sample sizes that tend to be of the order of magnitude of the population size itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marketing and the economic sector were the first areas of activity to seize these new opportunities, in the interests of financial gains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, the political sphere has adopted these new opportunities and has tried to take advantage of them to gain greater insight into the preferences and political persuasion of voters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A perfect example of this tendency can be found in the leak of sensitive personal data concerning nearly 200 million Americans, compiled for the Republican party during the Trump 2016 campaign ( 99% of the electorate), which occurred in July 2017 [76].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We took considerable care during the entire Politoscope project to anonymize the processed data and to produce aggregate data only, thus making it impossible to identify specific individuals, with the exception of a small number of well-known political figures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the research presented in this paper demonstrates that it is possible, using the conspicuous trails left in the public digital domain, and with relatively accessible computational means, to catalog a significant proportion of the electorate of an entire country, according to their political orientations, even though, as we have pointed out, there is still a certain margin of uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this observation, it is important for citizens to realize that they can be accountable for any trace they leave on the web.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The open platform politoscope.org is, in particular, designed to promote this awareness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can only count on the honesty and good faith of current and future political leaders to refrain from using, as has happened so often in the past and continues to be the case in certain countries [7780], data of this type for the purposes of discrimination, manipulation, or even repression and persecution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
