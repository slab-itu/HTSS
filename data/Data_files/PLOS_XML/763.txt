The Steady State Great Ape?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long Term Isotopic Records Reveal the Effects of Season, Social Rank and Reproductive Status on Bonobo Feeding Behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dietary ecology of extant great apes is known to respond to environmental conditions such as climate and food availability, but also to vary depending on social status and life history characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bonobos (Pan paniscus) live under comparatively steady ecological conditions in the evergreen rainforests of the Congo Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bonobos are an ideal species for investigating influences of sociodemographic and physiological factors, such as female reproductive status, on diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigate the long term dietary pattern in wild but fully habituated bonobos by stable isotope analysis in hair and integrating a variety of long-term sociodemographic information obtained through observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in 432 hair sections obtained from 101 non-invasively collected hair samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These samples represented the dietary behavior of 23 adult bonobos from 2008 through 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By including isotope and crude protein data from plants we could establish an isotope baseline and interpret the results of several general linear mixed models using the predictors climate, sex, social rank, reproductive state of females, adult age and age of infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that low canopy foliage is a useful isotopic tracer for tropical rainforest settings, and consumption of terrestrial herbs best explains the temporal isotope patterns we found in carbon isotope values of bonobo hair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the diet of male bonobos was affected by social rank, with lower nitrogen isotope values in low-ranking young males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Female isotope values mainly differed between different stages of reproduction (cycling, pregnancy, lactation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These isotopic differences appear to be related to changes in dietary preference during pregnancy (high protein diet) and lactation (high energy diet), which allow to compensate for different nutritional needs during maternal investment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dietary ecology is a key aspect in the study of environmental and social adaptations in primate evolution [1,2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, stable isotopes have been introduced to the field of primate ecology research as a measure of temporal dietary variation and seasonality [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seasonality refers to regular fluctuations in abiotic factors such as climate within the annual cycle, which affect the phenology of plants and consequently the distribution and availability of potential foods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seasonal scarcity or richness in food resources has strong effects on many aspects of primate ecology, such as the timing of reproduction, mobility, sociality and life history [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some primate species are able to survive in habitats undergoing severe climatic and ecological shifts, others dwell in more stable environments in which foliage or ripe fruit are available all year round [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bonobos (Pan paniscus) are a good example of primates adapted to such comparatively stable habitats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bonobos are found exclusively south of the Congo River in the evergreen rainforests of the Congo Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a comparative isotope study on African great apes by Oelze and coworkers [8] integrated a previously published isotope dataset on wild bonobos [9], which revealed relatively little variation in bonobo stable isotope ratios over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, variation in nitrogen stable isotopes was lower than in any other analyzed population of apes [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low isotopic variation over time may be explained by the stable climatic characteristics of the Congo Basin [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the relatively low variability in climatic seasonality in the bonobos habitat, it is particularly interesting to study within-group dietary differences that are independent of food abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study employing stable isotope analysis in hair, we investigate the temporal dietary pattern in wild bonobos in great detail by integrating a variety of long-term sociodemographic information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An_isotopic_approach_to_study_primate_feeding_ecology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stable isotopes of carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) are increasingly utilized biochemical markers to reconstruct the feeding ecology in extinct and extant primate species [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable isotope ecology makes use of the fact that you are what you eat, as the isotopic characteristics of the main food components are incorporated in consumers body tissue with a predictable enrichment caused by isotopic fractionation [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atmospheric carbon enters the biosphere via photosynthesis in green plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Terrestrial habitats such as tropical rainforests are dominated by C3-plants, where variation in 13C values is mainly driven by the so-called canopy effect [12,13] and by systematic differences between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic plant parts [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some primate species, such as baboons, are also known to consume C4-plants [4], they are not frequently utilized by great apes, even if C4-foods are available in their habitats [15,16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nitrogen is predominantly assimilated by plants from the substrate via N2-fixing bacteria, which results in differences in the 15N values between locations with different soil properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an excess of nitrogen and complex nitrogen pathways, tropical forests are generally enriched in 15N values as compared to temperate forest systems [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the same location, there are differences in 15N values between the majority of plants utilizing nitrogen from the soil and those plants able to directly assimilate atmospheric nitrogen such as plants of the Legiminosae family and some liana species [18,19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 15N values vary most strikingly along the food chain, with the lowest values found in plants, elevated 15N values in primary consumers, and the highest 15N values found in carnivores [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This isotopic increase with trophic level make the analysis of 15N values particularly useful in monitoring and quantifying carnivory and insectivory in wild primates [21,22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A combined study of 13C and 15N patterns in wild animals can provide insight into their feeding niches [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sampling of incremental body tissues such as dental and keratinous tissue can offer additional information on how adaptation to a specific niche varies with time, as seasonal shifts in food availability and/or feeding behavior will be retained in the tissues that developed during the respective time period of dietary change [5,10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In primatology, two non-invasively collectible sample types have proven particularly useful to reconstruct temporal variation in diet: dung [24] and hair keratin [4,5,9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While dung rapidly reflects the diet of the previous day(s), hair has the advantage to retain a multi-seasonal dietary signal within a single sample, which can be extracted by segmental sectioning of hair along its growth trajectory [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pioneering work using this hair segmental approach was conducted on domestic cattle [25] and free-ranging African mammals [2628].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analyzing tail hair from a group of elephants, Cerling and colleagues [28] could reconstruct the migratory and feeding behavior of an elephant family over multiple years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In great apes, diet changes within the previous five to ten months can be monitored using isotope analysis in individual hair samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from Gabon have been shown to predominantly shift in 13C values due to varying proportions of herbs versus fruits in their diet, sympatric chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) varied significantly in 15N values as they shifted from one species of fruit to another, which had been found to differ in their 15N values [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent comparative study including isotope data from all African great ape species, different temporal patterns emerged in hair samples of apes adapted to different environments [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_aims_of_this_study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we present an extensive hair isotope dataset from one group of habituated bonobos over the course of almost two full annual cycles (November 2008 to July 2010).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study extends previous work on bonobo isotope ecology [8,9] by relating measures of isotopic values to information on social and life history parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This offers a unique opportunity to assess subtle variation in isotope values within and between individuals that not only consider modest changes in diet but also effects such as age, sex, rank, and reproductive status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below we formulate predictions how parameters other than food abundance may influence the isotopic signatures in bonobos over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study was carried out at the field site of LuiKotale (02° 45.610S, 20° 22.723E), near Salonga National Park, DRC [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate parameters including minimum and maximum temperatures in °C and precipitation amounts in mm were measured daily at the field site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combined previously measured bonobo hair stable isotope values (n = 95 from 39 hair samples) dating from 2008 to 2009 [8,9] with a substantial new isotope dataset (n = 337) obtained from 62 bonobo hair samples collected in 2010 (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting dataset of a total of 432 hair section measurements is the largest isotope dataset to date on a group of extant great apes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All new hair samples were retrieved by an experienced tree climber from night nests of free-ranging bonobos of the Bompusa community in LuiKotale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals building nests were identified during nest-to-nest follows and trees were climbed to pick hair samples after the bonobos left the nest site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hair sample collection in the wild was strictly non-invasive and thus not subject to recommendations of the Weatherall report (The Use of Non-Human Primates in Research).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hairs samples were stored dry in pergamin envelopes and shipped to Germany adhered to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), including CITES documents (N/Ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  00651/ICCN/ DG/ADG/KBY/2011).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As previous vegetation samples from Salonga forest were biased toward high canopy foods (fruits), additional plant food items (n = 37) were collected opportunistically, with a focus on low canopy foods between 2010 and 2013, and stored dry on silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also included data on plant crude protein from previous studies on bonobo feeding ecology [40] in our analyses of these plants (S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The communitys dominance hierarchy was based on behavioral interactions observed between December 2007 and July 2009, as described in detail elsewhere [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While in early 2009 the study community consisted of 35 individuals [9], several individuals disappeared from the community in 2009 (n = 2) and 2010 (n = 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the calculated linear dominance hierarchy within the community was adjusted after each disappearance event for statistical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information on life histories of individual bonobos, including estimated or known birth year, sex, age of infant, and month/year of disappearance were gathered from the long-term database of the LuiKotale Bonobo Research project.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The categories for female reproductive status (cycling, pregnant or lactating) were based on data available on infant birth dates (see S1 Table and details below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Isotope_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hair sample preparation followed the procedure outlined in Oelze [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hairs were washed in a chloroform/methanol solution (2:1 v/v) in a rotator overnight to remove lipids and external contaminants [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dried hair strands were transferred to a microscope working space and sorted for hairs with roots in the telogen stage (pale yellowish root bulbs) to reduce growth cycle error [43] as much as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, all short and thin hairs were excluded to avoid unintentional sampling of infant individuals [3,9], leaving per hair sample, on average, 12 hairs of 67 cm length of equal thickness and color.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These samples were then aligned at their roots and sectioned with a scalpel into 5 and 10 mm sections as weight allowed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, each hair section ( 0.2 mg) was transferred into tin capsules for isotopic measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All plant items were dried in an oven at 50°C for several days, homogenized with a pestle and mortar, and weighed into tin capsules (~ 2 mg) for duplicate isotopic measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All measurements were performed parallel to the IAEA standards CH6, CH7, N1 and N2 as well as several internal standard materials in a Flash EA 2112 (Thermo-Finnigan®, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a DeltaXP mass spectrometer (Thermo-Finnigan®, Bremen, Germany) at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen are expressed as the ratio of 13C/12C and 15N/14N ratios using the delta () notation in parts per thousand or per mil () relative to the international standard materials Vienna PeeDee Belemite (vPDB) and atmospheric N2 (AIR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurement error calculated from these standard materials is less than 0.2  (1) for the 13C and 15N values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure analytical quality, we excluded nine hair isotope data points with atomic C/N ratios outside the acceptable 2.6 to 3.8 range [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We excluded all data points obtained from bulk hair samples reported in the previous work by Oelze and coworkers [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to a lack of hair growth rates for the genus Pan, we considered Homo sapiens hair growth rates of 10 mm for 28 days [44] in the subsequent data analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used R (version 3.1.0, [45]] to conduct statistical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed several general linear mixed models (GLMM) with Gaussian error structure using the lmer-function [46] on the responses 15N and 13C to test effects of various predictors on plant and bonobo hair isotope data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant_isotopes_and_THV_consumption  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that previous measurements on plant crude protein (%dry mass) are positively correlated with %N measures obtained in this study during stable isotope analysis (Spearman correlation: R = 0.83, N = 43, p less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not surprising as phytochemical analyses used an elemental analyzer system for determination of nitrogen content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These %N values were converted into crude protein estimations using a conversion factor of 6.25 [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied the same equation to our %N data and found that estimates of crude protein content differs significantly between the different food categories as defined in S1 Table (2 = 9.871, df = 4, p = 0.042), with the highest protein content in terrestrial herbaceous vegetation and the lowest in fruits, which is well in line with previous nutritional research on plant foods consumed by Pan species [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest calculations of crude protein based on %N could be considered more frequently in dietary reconstructions by means of stable isotopes, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in stable isotope mixing models [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we assume the protein fraction of the diet has a stronger effect on isotope ratios in body proteins such as hair [54], the relevance of specific food items could be weighted by their crude protein content in such models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the plant 15N values of different plant categories (herb, shrub, tree fruit, tree non-food) did not differ from each other (2 = 2.807, df = 4, p = 0.590), differences between plant categories were highly significant in terms of 13C values (2 = 31.348, df = 4, p less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found the lowest 13C values in herbs and shrubs and the highest values in fruits of trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a vertical stratigraphy in 13C values within the forest canopy [12], but probably also differences between plant parts [14] as seen between fruits and non-fruit items of the same tree species (see S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bonobos feeding on these plant foods in different proportions would be expected to show low variation in their hair 15N values, but higher variation in their 13C values, particularly if they switch between high canopy fruits and low canopy foliage such as THV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
THV is an important component in bonobo diet and this protein rich terrestrial vegetation is abundant in forested habitats inhabited by them [29,55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regular THV consumption by bonobos has been hypothesized to be a key parameter explaining the high levels of female gregariousness in this species [56] with implication for sex-differences in cooperation and other aspects of their social lives [57,58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Seasonal_patterns  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When including the climate data into our statistical analyses we found that the effect of temperature with a time lag of 52 and 28 days respectively was significant in the 13C model (mean weighted 2 = 26.071, df = 8, p = 0.0010) and in the 15N model (mean weighted 2 = 29.791, df = 8, p = 0.0002).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that 13C and 15N values in bonobo hair significantly increased as temperature increased (see Fig 1A and 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these isotopic increases were admittedly very small; our model estimate revealed with 1°C increase in temperature a 0.11 increase in 13C values and an increase of 0.06  in 15N values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest the effect of temporal variation in response to temperature (season) is overall subtle, yet more pronounced in 13C values than in 15N values, which is well in line with the stronger variation in plant 13C values and the more homogenous plant 15N values in the Salonga forest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the plant 13C baseline, we conclude that low 13C values in bonobos indicate the consumption of higher proportions of low canopy foods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this respect the bonobo isotope pattern is similar to that of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from Loango, Gabon, which varied significantly in their hair 13C values over time, but not in their 15N values [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hair 13C values of Loango gorillas ranged from -27.1  to -24.5 , whereas the bonobo isotope values we report here ranged from -26.5  to -24.7 .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the dietary shifts are less pronounced in bonobos as compared to Western lowland gorillas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected to find a dietary pattern with low variation in a habitat with little seasonal variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparatively constant environmental conditions within this area of the Congo Basin distinguish the bonobos feeding ecology from other great ape species in Africa, particularly in respect to 15N signatures [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be tested whether the same pattern can be detected in other Pan populations within the Congo Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effects_of_social_rank_and_sex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this new extended dataset on bonobo hair isotopes the effect of sex/reproductive status interacting with social rank was significant in 15N values (2 = 13.63, df = 3, p less_than 0.004).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the effect of rank on 15N values and thus probably the access to 15N-enriched food items (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  animal protein) is different between males and/or females with the different reproductive status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2A and 2B show that the effect of rank on the bonobos isotope signatures differs between males and females: in females, the regression lines do not differ significantly from zero, regardless of reproductive status, indicating no differences in 15N values due to social rank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-ranking males, however, have significantly lower 15N values than high-ranking males and also than females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sex and social rank is known to influence the access to certain foods in Pan species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limited resources such as meat or certain fruit may be shared with non-kin to maintain or strengthen social bonds with coalition partners [5860].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed adolescent male bonobos are often excluded from meat sharing events [58,61], and although the first isotope study did not reveal evidence for faunivory at LuiKotale, less frequent meat consumption may be a plausible explanation for depleted 15N values in low-ranking adolescent males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the 13C values we could test sex/reproductive status separately from social rank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the effect of sex/reproductive status was significant (2 = 16.056, df = 3, p = 0.0011), social rank did not predict bonobo 13C values (2 = 0.1638, df = 1, p = 0.686).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for alternative 13C-models, including age instead of social rank and both age and social rank revealed slightly lower AICs than the original model only comprising social rank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggested better model fits for models considering the effect of age in 13C values, but our approach did not allow for testing this effect further for significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in 13C values between females with different reproductive statuses and males can be interpreted without the interacting effect of social dominance rank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss our findings in more detail below as the effect appears to be linked to the reproductive status of females and not to sex in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reproductive_status_of_females  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The isotope ecology at LuiKotale, with comparatively low seasonality, allows for investigating possible variation that is not only linked to resource availability and dietary choice but also to differences in physiological conditions among individuals with different reproductive states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected cycling females without dependent offspring would be similar to males, while pregnant females or females with dependent offspring would differ isotopically from other adult community members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our long-term isotope dataset on free-ranging habituated bonobos is the most comprehensive of its kind to date and the first allowing for testing the relationships between environmental, social and demographic factors, and stable isotope ratios in hair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our plant analyses we conclude that low canopy foliage such as THV can be considered a useful isotopic tracer in tropical forest settings to reconstruct feeding niches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  THV is particularly low in 13C values, rich in crude protein and thus its consumption should be well detectable in hair protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to show that social dominance rank does indeed affect individual access to high trophic level food resources in male bonobos, but not in females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In females, our results suggest the diet mainly differs between individuals in different phases of reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If our interpretation of female bonobo isotope patterns is suitable, the 13C values of female primates are mainly driven by food choice, while the 15N values in these capital breeders may be influenced additionally by the physiological demands of reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption should be tested in other primate species in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings may find increased consideration in future ecological research employing stable isotope analysis in wild and captive capital breeders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
