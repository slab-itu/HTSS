Aedes aegypti D7 Saliva Protein Inhibits Dengue Virus Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of several medically relevant arboviruses including dengue virus (DENV) types 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti transmits DENV by inoculating virus-infected saliva into host skin during probing and feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti saliva contains over one hundred unique proteins and these proteins have diverse functions, including facilitating blood feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, we showed that Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti salivary gland extracts (SGEs) enhanced dissemination of DENV to draining lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, HPLC-fractionation revealed that some SGE components inhibited infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that D7 proteins are enriched in HPLC fractions that are inhibitory to DENV infection, and that recombinant D7 protein can inhibit DENV infection in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, binding assays indicate that D7 protein can directly interact with DENV virions and recombinant DENV envelope protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data reveal a novel role for D7 proteins, which inhibits arbovirus transmission to vertebrates through a direct interaction with virions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti during the blood feeding process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During blood feeding, DENV and saliva proteins are inoculated into human skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D7 proteins are prevalent and immunogenic proteins present in Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti saliva, and assist the blood feeding process by scavenging biogenic amines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous data suggests that antibodies against D7 protein from Culex spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  can increase West Nile virus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that D7 proteins may also have antiviral activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that recombinant Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti D7 protein can inhibit DENV infection in vitro and in vivo, and that D7 can bind to DENV virions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus that is transmitted primarily by the species Aedes aegypti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The global burden of DENV has grown dramatically in the last few decades [1, 2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now expect approximately one hundred million clinically recognized cases of disease each year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeted therapeutics do not exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fortunately, conventional vaccines are in development and regulatory approval has been granted in a few countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Development of a conventional DENV vaccine has been difficult due to the co-circulation of four serotypes [3, 4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is critical that conventional vaccines elicit robust antibody titers to avoid antibody-dependent enhancement, which occurs during a sub-neutralizing response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is theoretically possible to target mosquito saliva or midgut proteins to block either transmission or acquisition of DENV [3, 5, 6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy would not be subject to antibody-dependent enhancement or viral genetic drift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti saliva contains over one hundred unique proteins that have been classified as D7 proteins, phosphatidylethanolamine binding proteins, odorant and juvenile hormone binding proteins, serpins and other protease inhibitors, a sialokinin vasodilator, nucleotidases, serine proteases, sugar digestion related proteins and other enzymes, lectins, angiopoietins, anti-microbial proteins and peptides, mucins and peritrophins, antigen 5 proteins, and many more proteins of unknown function [711].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional data is not available for the majority of these proteins, although it is expected that the saliva of all hematophagous arthropods have anti-coagulant, anti-platelet, and vasodilatory activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also likely that saliva proteins serve to reduce host inflammation and prevent infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the normal physiological roles of hematophagous arthropod saliva, many vector-borne microorganisms have enhanced fitness in the presence of arthropod saliva.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arthropod saliva can enhance infectivity of West Nile virus, DENV, Rift Valley fever virus, and Powassan virus, among others [5, 1218].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact mechanism of saliva-mediated infectivity enhancement is not known, although prior literature suggests that saliva proteins may locally modify the immune system in favor of arbovirus replication and/or stimulate dissemination by enhancing migration of target cells to draining lymph nodes [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, individual saliva components can have inhibitory activities against arbovirus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the collagen-binding protein aegyptin decreased DENV infection in vivo [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, previous literature showed that vaccination of mice with a recombinant D7 protein from Culex spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  enhanced mortality in a West Nile virus mouse model, suggesting that D7 protein may be inhibitory in vivo [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural studies suggest that D7 proteins can simultaneously bind biogenic amines and cysteinyl leukotrienes, which is likely involved in preventing the host inflammatory response [21, 22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prevention of the host inflammatory response may reduce influx or activation of target cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our previous work relied on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to fractionate Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti salivary gland extracts (SGEs) [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HPLC fractions were tested to see if they had virus enhancing or blocking activities in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identified a number of fractions that inhibited DENV cell binding and then pooled these fractions for downstream tandem liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC+MS/MS) analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D7 proteins were the most abundant proteins in the inhibitory fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We synthesized a recombinant D7 protein and found that it inhibited DENV infection in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the D7 protein interacted directly with DENV virions and recombinant envelope protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support a model whereby D7 proteins inhibit DENV infection through two independent mechanisms: (i) direct binding and neutralization of DENV virions, and (ii) inhibition of immune cell infiltration or activation, which reduces the number of permissive target cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterization of virus-vector-host interactions at the transmission interface will further development of arthropod-based therapeutics and transmission-blocking vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mosquito_rearing_and_saliva_material_collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aedes aegypti were provided by staff at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mosquitoes were maintained in a sugar solution at 27°C and 80% humidity according to standard rearing procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salivary glands and saliva were isolated as described previously [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salivary gland extracts were prepared by placing 100 salivary glands in 100 l sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), freeze-thawing by placing on dry ice three times, and then removing insoluble debris by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saliva was isolated using the immersion oil technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_culture_and_virus_stocks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and a human monocyte-like (U937) cell line from the American Type Culture Collection were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37°C with 5% CO2 (Gibco).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C6/36 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, tryptose phosphate, and antibiotics at 30°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DENV2 was passaged in C6/36 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DENV2 New Guinea C strain was obtained from the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station and C6/36 cells were a kind gift from Erol Fikrig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 1 × 105 genome equivalents (GE) were used for in vitro infections of MEFs and U937 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HPLC_fractionation_and_LC+MS_MS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One hundred salivary glands were dissected from female Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti and placed in 100 l PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was freeze-thawed three times at 80°C, and insoluble debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was reserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SGE was either processed directly for LC+MS/MS analysis or fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a nonporous reverse-phase column with a TFA buffer system into 80 100-l fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten l of each fraction was diluted into 90 l PBS and used as SGE treatments for in vitro SGE-mediated cell binding assays as stated below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 90 l from inhibitory fractions 3149 were pooled and submitted for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC+MS/MS) analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proteins were digested with trypsin and analyzed using LC+MS/MS on a Thermo Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer using Waters nanoACQUITY ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatographs (UPLC) for peptide separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MS/MS spectra were searched in-house using the Mascot algorithm for uninterpreted MS/MS spectra after using the Mascot Distiller program to generate Mascot-compatible files.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An A. aegypti database was used for searching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Keck Biotechnology Resource at Yale University performed both HPLC and LC+MS/MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_vitro_cell_binding_assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MEFs were seeded at 25,000 cells/well in 48-well plates and grown to approximately 70% confluence overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Medium was aspirated, and cells were washed with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten l of HPLC fractions were diluted in a total volume of 100 l PBS and inoculated into cells at room temperature for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saliva material was removed, and then Approximately 1 × 105 GE of DENV2 was inoculated into cells in a total volume of 500 l for 1 h at 37°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbound virus was then removed, and fresh medium was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infections progressed for up to 18 h. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy kits (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For analysis of relative DENV vRNA, total RNA was harvested using RNeasy kits (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplification of both the viral target and reference gene target was performed using a duplex format in 0.2-ml, 96-well PCR plates (Bio-Rad) with a total reaction volume of 25 l. Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were performed in the same closed tube with 250 ng of total RNA per reaction using the Quantitect RT-PCR kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All primers were used at a final concentration of 4 M and were synthesized by the Keck Facility at Yale University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DENV2 vRNA was amplified using F 5 CCACTGCCTCTGGAAAACTC 3 and R 5 GTACCAGCACCCATCCTCAC 3 primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers were developed using Gene Link Software (OligoAnalyzer 1.2 and OligoExplorer 1.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All RT-qPCRs were performed using an iQ5 machine (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cycling conditions were 50°C for 30 min (reverse transcription) and 95°C for 15 min, followed by 42 cycles of 94°C for 15 s and 54.5°C for 1 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative quantities of viral target cDNA were determined using REST software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cloning  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti total cellular RNA was converted to cDNA using random primers and the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long form D7 protein (AAEL006424) was amplified using F 5 GGAGGTACCGATGAAGCTGCCTCTATTACTCGCAATAGTTAC 3 and R 5 GGAGCGGCCGCAATTGTGGACACTGTTTACCGTCG 3 primers and cloned into the pMT/BiP/V5-His A plasmid via BamHI and NotI restriction sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pMT/BiP/D7/V5-His A and pCoHygro plasmids were transfected into S2 cells using the calcium phosphate method according to manufacturers instructions (ThermoFischer) and a stable cell line was generated through hygromycin selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D7 synthesis and secretion was induced by treating cells with copper sulfate according to manufacturers instructions (ThermoFisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D7 expression was confirmed by Coomassie Blue gel staining and Western blot using an anti-6 His antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants were also harvested from uninduced S2 cell supernatants and used as negative controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_vitro_infectivity_assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
D7 protein was purified using HisPur Cobalt Spin Columns (Thermo Scientific/Pierce, MA) according to manufacturer instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were a total of 3 washes and 3 elutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were stored at -80°C until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The U937 cell line (ATCC, VA) was used for the in vitro infection studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini, CA), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D7 was used in 1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000 dilutions in complete media for final concentrations of 8, 0.8, and 0.08 ng/mL, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dilutions were added for pretreatment of cells in a total volume of 250 L. Cells were then incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and then DENV was added to cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simultaneous treatments, ten-fold dilutions of D7 were mixed with DENV2 and these mixtures were pre-incubated for 1 hour at 37°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D7-DENV2 mixtures were then inoculated onto cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbound virions were removed by washing after 1 hour and then cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was isolated from cells and qRT-PCR performed as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DENV2 vRNA was amplified using Forward: 5 CAG ATC TCT GAT GAA TAA CCA ACG 3 and Reverse: 5 CAT TCC AAG TGA GAA TCT CTT TGT CA 3 primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human B2M RNA was amplified using Forward: 5 CTC CGT GGC CTT AGC TGT G 3 and Reverse: 5 TTT GGA GTA CGC TGG ATA GCC T 3 primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Animals were maintained and procedures were performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protocol 14051879 was approved by the University of Pittsburgh's IACUC committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approved euthanasia criteria were based on weight loss and morbidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_vivo_infectivity_assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice deficient in receptors for type I and type II interferons, (IFNAGR-/-, AGB6) were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Groups of 4-5-week-old, age-matched, mixed-sex AGB6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously into both rear footpads with 20 l containing either 107 genome equivalents (GE) of either DENV2 alone or DENV2 plus recombinant D7 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DENV2 alone samples contained purified S2 cell supernatant without D7 protein as a vehicle control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty-eight hours post-infection, mice were euthanized and left and right foot pads and left and right popliteal draining lymph nodes (DLN) were collected independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qRT-PCR was performed by adding equal amounts of RNA into each reaction and data were normalized to the actin reference gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse actin RNA was amplified using Forward: 5 GGC TGT ATT CCC CTC CAT CG 3 and Reverse: 5 CCA GTT GGT AAC AAT GCC ATG T 3 primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplification of targets were performed using a duplex format in 0.2 ml, 96-well PCR plates (BIO-RAD) with a total reaction volume of 25 l. Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR were performed in the same closed tube with 100 ng of total RNA per reaction using the Quantitect RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Salivary_gland_extract-DENV_virion_binding_assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Seventy g of anti-dengue virus type II antibody, clone 3H5-1 (Millipore) was covalently coupled to 25 L amine-active resin according to the Pierce Co-Immunoprecipitation Kit manual (ThermoFisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred g purified, formaldehyde-inactivated dengue virus type 2 virions (Microbix) was then mixed with 100 Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti salivary gland equivalents and added to the antibody-containing resin with gentle end-over-end mixing for 2 hr at 4°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbound proteins were washed away and bound proteins were eluted in a final volume of 50 L. The experimental details are described in the Pierce Co-Immunoprecipitation Kit manual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eluted proteins were identified by LC+MS/MS analysis as stated above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Enzyme-linked_immunosorbent_assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High binding 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4°C with a 1:1 dilution of D7 or matrix metalloproteinase protein (MMP; AAEL003012) in coating buffer (R&D systems) for a 0.01mg/mL final concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next day, plates were rinsed twice with PBS and blocked with blocking buffer (1% BSA in 1XPBST) for 1 h at 37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plates were incubated with 80L of DENV 2 strain 186881 (2x105 p.f.u) or recombinant DENV Envelope protein (1g/mL) (L2 Diagnostics, CT) overnight at 4°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plates were washed three times with buffer (1X PBST+ 0.01% Tween 20) and incubated with a 1:250 dilution of primary antibody for 1h at 37°C: mouse anti-DENV2 antibody (MAB10226, Millipore) to detect virus and mouse anti-E antibody (MA1-71251, Pierce) to detect envelope protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing plates three times, wells were incubated with 100 L of a 1:1000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) and washed after 1h of incubation at 37°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reaction was visualized after incubating with 80 L of TMB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 3min the reaction was stopped with stop solution (2M Sulfuric acid) and plates were read at 450nm in a Synergy HT plate reader (Biotek Instruments Inc., VT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Identification_of_D7_proteins_in_inhibitory_salivary_gland_extract_high_performance_liquid_chromatography_fractions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously showed that pre-treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with salivary gland extract (SGE) increased DENV cell binding [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reverse phase HPLC fractionation and LC+MS/MS analysis was then used to identify fractions of Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti salivary gland extract (SGE) that increased DENV vRNA levels associated with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)[5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this analysis, we also noted that a cluster of HPLC fractions (i.e., 3149) inhibited DENV infection (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fractions were pooled and submitted for LC+MS/MS analysis and searched against the NCBI Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti database to identify the most abundant proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple proteins were identified with high score values, although long forms of the D7 protein family were the most prevalent (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of these proteins were not predicted as secreted proteins that would be present in saliva.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the proteins that are present in saliva and may play a role at the virus-vector-host interface, saliva was harvested from one hundred Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti using the immersion oil technique [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soluble proteins were extracted from immersion oil using phosphate buffered saline and the sample was submitted for LC+MS/MS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that 7 proteins in the inhibitory fraction are also present in saliva (Tables 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of these proteins were either long or short form D7 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a separate experiment, we sought to elucidate proteins that are upregulated in salivary glands during DENV2 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti were either mock or infected with DENV2 via blood feeding using an artificial membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty salivary glands were isolated from each group of mosquitoes 14 dpi and equal amounts of protein were loaded on to an SDS-PAGE gel for one-dimensional gel electrophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple bands were different between mock and DENV2 lanes, but one band appeared significantly darker in the DENV2-infected lane (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The band from the DENV2-infected lane was excised and submitted for mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only four unique Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti proteins were detected, which included tropomyosin, two long form D7 proteins, and a 34 kDa salivary protein (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that both long and short form D7 proteins and the 34 kDa salivary protein are upregulated in Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti salivary glands at the transcriptional level during DENV2 infection by assessing previously published RNA Seq data (Table 3) [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Recombinant_D7_protein_inhibits_dengue_virus_in_vitro_and_in_vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti D7 proteins are multifunctional and have been shown to bind to cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLT) and biogenic amines with high affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the discovery of D7 proteins in inhibitory HPLC fractions, and of increased D7 protein expression in DENV2-infected salivary glands, we hypothesized that D7 proteins may bind to additional substrates with varying affinities, and that these interactions inhibit DENV cell binding and infectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, a recombinant D7 long form protein (AAEL006424) was produced in S2 cells and harvested from the supernatant at a concentration of 80 ng/mL (Fig 3A and 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined if D7 protein was toxic to cells by incubating ten-fold dilutions of D7 protein with monocyte-like U937 cells for 24 hours followed by analysis using Promegas CellTox Green Cytotoxicity Assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assay measures membrane integrity that occurs as a result of cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both positive and negative controls were included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the dilutions tested were toxic to U937 cells at the time point tested (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then tested if D7 protein had antiviral activity in vitro by either pre-incubating U937 cells with ten-fold dilutions of recombinant D7 protein for 1 hour at 37°C prior to inoculation with DENV2, or incubating ten-fold dilutions of D7 protein with DENV2 for 1 hour at 37°C prior to co-treatment with D7-DENV2 mixtures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different treatment strategies were employed to determine if D7 needed to directly interact with virions for activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was extracted 24 hpi and the relative amount of DENV2 vRNA was normalized to a housekeeping gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both pre-treatment and co-treatment of recombinant D7 protein and DENV2 significantly reduced DENV2 vRNA levels in U937 cells and there wasnt a statistical difference between these two treatment groups (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A post-treatment experiment was also performed to determine if D7 inhibited DENV at an early time point during infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this experiment, U937 cells were infected with DENV for 24 hours, followed by an 8 hour treatment with ten-fold dilutions of D7 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was extracted 48 hpi and the relative amount of DENV2 vRNA was normalized to a housekeeping gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This treatment strategy did not significantly inhibit DENV infection, suggesting that D7 inhibits DENV at an early time point (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested if an irrelevant His-tagged protein could inhibit DENV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant His-tagged GFP was unable to inhibit DENV infection at the highest concentration tested for D7 (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if recombinant D7 can inhibit DENV2 infection in vivo, we challenged AGB6 mice with DENV2 with and without D7 protein by subcutaneous footpad inoculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AGB6 mice were chosen because they are highly permissive to DENV2 infection and were a suitable model for early DENV2 replication and dissemination to draining lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 2 groups of 4-5-week-old, age-matched, sex-matched mice were inoculated into a single rear footpad with 20 l containing 1 x 107 genome equivalents, DENV2 alone or in combination with approximately 1 ng recombinant D7 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to test the impact of D7 treatment on early replication and dissemination, RNA was harvested from footpads and draining lymph nodes 48 hpi and qRT-PCR was used to measure the relative levels of DENV2 normalized to an actin reference gene [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D7 protein significantly reduced DENV2 vRNA levels in both the footpads and draining lymph nodes 24 hpi (Fig 5A and 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DENV2 vRNA amplified at Ct values of 2124 in footpad samples and 1719 in draining lymph node samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Our results suggest that D7 protein can inhibit DENV2 infection in vitro and in vivo, although it is unclear how D7 protein mediates its antiviral effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pre-treatment of U937 cells with recombinant D7 protein led to a significant decrease in DENV2 infection, suggesting that D7 protein may modulate the host cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, co-treatment of D7 protein with DENV2 appeared to be more effective at preventing cell binding and/or infection of U937 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that D7 protein can interact with multiple substrates including proteins at the cell surface and viral proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we performed binding assays to determine if D7 protein can bind to DENV virions and envelope protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, anti-DENV2 antibody, clone 3H5-1 was covalently coupled to 25 L amine-active resin in two separate columns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred g of purified, formaldehyde-inactivated dengue virus type 2 virions was then mixed with 100 Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti salivary gland equivalents and added to the antibody-containing resin and incubated for 2 hr at 4°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A negative control column containing anti-DENV2 antibody was also prepared with only 100 salivary gland equivalents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbound proteins were washed away and bound proteins were eluted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eluted proteins were identified by LC+MS/MS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Mascot scores were low, 8 proteins were identified that were unique and not in the negative control and three of these were present in saliva (Tables 2 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This included the long form D7 protein (AAEL006424).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if the proteins we detected were simply correlated with their abundance, we performed LC+MS/MS analysis on Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti salivary gland extracts (Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although actin and serine protease inhibitor (serpin) had Mascot scores in the top 3%, Mascot data suggested that the remaining proteins were less abundant, and that our co-immunoprecipitation data did not simply represent the most abundant proteins in salivary gland extracts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm if D7 protein can directly interact with DENV2, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by binding a control MMP protein or recombinant D7 protein to a 96 well plate [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plates were then incubated with DENV2 16881 virions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbound proteins were then removed by washing each well with buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of association between immobilized proteins and DENV2 virions was assessed using an antibody that recognized DENV followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to horse radish peroxidase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DENV2 16881 virions bound to D7 protein more readily than MMP protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plates coated with D7 protein were then incubated with bovine serum albumin, DENV2 16881 virions, or recombinant DENV2 envelope protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbound proteins were then removed by washing each well with buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of association between D7 and the above proteins was assessed using an antibody recognizing DENV followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with horse radish peroxidase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that recombinant D7 interacted with both DENV2 16881 virions and recombinant DENV2 envelope protein (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hematophagous arthropod saliva contains a complex mixture of proteins with anti-hemostatic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hematophagous arthropod saliva can also enhance transmission of arboviruses, although the exact mechanism and saliva proteins involved in this process are not known [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, individual saliva components can have inhibitory activities that prevent arbovirus infection [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identified D7 protein in biochemical fractions of salivary gland extracts that inhibited DENV2 cell binding and/or infection in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and then determined if this activity could be recapitulated with recombinant D7 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that recombinant D7 protein prevented DENV2 cell binding and/or infection in two permissive cell types and prevented infection and dissemination in a mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, two separate binding assays suggest that D7 protein can physically interact with DENV virions and envelope protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support the previous observation that D7 protein vaccination enhanced mortality in a West Nile virus mouse model and suggest that D7 protein inhibits virus transmission [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
D7 proteins are some of the most abundant proteins expressed in the salivary glands of blood feeding Diptera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long and short forms of D7 proteins exist in mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these proteins appear capable of binding either cysteinyl leukotrienes, and/or biogenic amines such as serotonin, histamine, and norepinephrine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These functions are predicted to antagonize the hosts inflammatory response, and ability to vasoconstrict, induce platelet-aggregation, and induce a sense of paineach critical to efficiently obtaining a blood meal [21, 22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is theoretically possible that the functions of D7 proteins are counter to the needs of arboviruses during transmission to a vertebrate host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D7 proteins bind multiple substrates and it is possible that they bind other proteins with lower affinity, which may limit virus-host interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, limiting the host inflammatory response may reduce influx or activation of target cells, such as Langerhans cells, monocytes, or macrophage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support that D7 protein mediates its antiviral effect through direct protein-protein interaction in vitro, although it is possible that modulation of the inflammatory response also occurs in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
D7 proteins are some of the most abundant and immunogenic proteins present in mosquito saliva [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of anti-D7 antibodies has been used as a marker of exposure to certain mosquito species [2629].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that individuals who are exposed to mosquitoes have high levels of anti-D7 antibodies, it is likely that these antibodies inhibit D7 protein function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the presence of anti-D7 antibodies has been linked to disease severity [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although anti-D7 antibodies may prevent efficient blood feeding by a mosquito, it may also enhance disease transmission and disease severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterizing the complex interplay of virus-vector-host interactions will lead to the development of better models of pathogenesis, strategies to limit disease transmission and promote the development of therapeutics, and transmission-blocking vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
