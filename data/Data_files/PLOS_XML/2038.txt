Stroke survivors' and informal caregivers' experiences of primary care and community healthcare services  A systematic review and meta-ethnography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Objective  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To describe and explain stroke survivors and informal caregivers experiences of primary care and community healthcare services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To offer potential solutions for how negative experiences could be addressed by healthcare services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Systematic review and meta-ethnography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_sources  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Medline, CINAHL, Embase and PsycINFO databases (literature searched until May 2015, published studies ranged from 1996 to 2015).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Eligibility_criteria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary qualitative studies focused on adult community-dwelling stroke survivors and/or informal caregivers experiences of primary care and/or community healthcare services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_synthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A set of common second order constructs (original authors interpretations of participants experiences) were identified across the studies and used to develop a novel integrative account of the data (third order constructs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relevance was assessed using Dixon-Woods criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
51 studies (including 168 stroke survivors and 328 caregivers) were synthesised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed three inter-dependent third order constructs: (1) marginalisation of stroke survivors and caregivers by healthcare services, (2) passivity versus proactivity in the relationship between health services and the patient/caregiver dyad, and (3) fluidity of stroke related needs for both patient and caregiver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Issues of continuity of care, limitations in access to services and inadequate information provision drove perceptions of marginalisation and passivity of services for both patients and caregivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluidity was apparent through changing information needs and psychological adaptation to living with long-term consequences of stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Limitations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Potential limitations of qualitative research such as limited generalisability and inability to provide firm answers are offset by the consistency of the findings across a range of countries and healthcare systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stroke survivors and caregivers feel abandoned because they have become marginalised by services and they do not have the knowledge or skills to re-engage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be addressed by: (1) increasing stroke specific health literacy by targeted and timely information provision, and (2) improving continuity of care between specialist and generalist services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Globally, stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third most important cause of disability burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1, 2] Stroke-related disability burden is on the rise with a 12% increase worldwide since 1990.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rise accounts for more than 100 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost ( 2 million in the USA alone, 0.66 in the UK) and contributes to the large economic burden of stroke due to healthcare utilisation, informal care and the loss of productivity (for example, DALYs of younger stroke survivors (less_than75 years old) account for 70% of DALYs lost).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1, 3] The cost of stroke is high and estimated at $33 billion (including health care cost, medicines and missed days of work)[4] in the USA, £8.9 billion per annum in the UK[3] and $5 billion in Australia (including healthcare, informal care and the loss of productivity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary care could play an important role in the care of stroke survivors and their caregivers, supporting access to community services, facilitating transfer back to specialist services when new problems emerge, providing training, respite care, and identifying and addressing health needs of caregivers, and managing those aspects of care that are traditionally managed in general practice (for example, risk factors and psychological issues).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the feeling of abandonment that people with stroke experience following hospital discharge suggests this role is not being completely fulfilled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [68] Qualitative reports indicate that lack of co-ordinated post-discharge care leaves patients and informal caregivers feeling unsupported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6, 812]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
No comprehensive systematic review of stroke survivors and caregivers specific experiences of primary care and community healthcare services has been performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous qualitative reviews offer a broader focus including experiences of acute services[13] or are more selective, omitting research focussed on specific problem areas (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  information provision[14]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meta-ethnography may offer new insight into how post-discharge care after stroke could be improved by providing a conceptual framework which surpasses simple aggregation of primary findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [15] Our aim was to synthesise qualitative evidence on community-dwelling stroke survivors and caregivers experiences of primary care and community healthcare services after stroke in order to explain where these experiences originate from and how they could be addressed by healthcare services and interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Search_strategy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A review protocol has been previously published[16] (PROSPERO 2015:CRD42015026602).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Searches of four electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, Embase and PsycINFO) were conducted by NAZ and VH between May and June 2015 (see appendix A) using PICo mnemonics[17]:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Caregivers were defined as unpaid carers, including spouse or partner, family members, friends, or significant others who provide physical, practical, transportation or emotional help [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Keywords relevant to the study type (qualitative, interview, focus group) were included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No date, language or country restrictions were applied, but we did not include non-English language papers in the synthesis; references of eligible articles were checked for relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_selection_and_data_collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We included studies that used qualitative methods of data collection and analysis, and described the experiences of adult ( 18 years old) community-dwelling stroke survivors and/or informal caregivers of primary care and community healthcare services after stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16] Community healthcare services included district nurses, community rehabilitation services (e.g., physiotherapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT))[18], speech and language therapist (SLT) and clinical psychology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We excluded papers which: 1) used mixed-methods designs where the qualitative data could not be separated; 2) included multiple patient populations; 3) focused on the in-patient setting, nursing or residential homes, or 4) multiple settings (for example, hospital, early supported discharge, nursing homes, community setting) and did not distinguish between them in their analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16] Descriptive data, quality assessment, themes identified by the authors and their description using authors original language or a paraphrase were recorded for each paper in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet by two independent reviewers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quality_appraisal  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quality of included studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Research Checklist (CASP)[19] by two reviewers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies could achieve a maximum score of 10 points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not exclude studies based on CASP quality assessment, but used this as descriptive information to add to the critical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies were rated for relevance using criteria introduced by Dixon-Woods et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [20] This divided papers into four categories in relation to our research objectives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firstly, key papers, were conceptually rich with potential to make an important contribution to the synthesis; Secondly, satisfactory papers had potential value to the synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies which were deemed irrelevant to our objectives or to have fatal methodological flaws were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fatal flaw was a subjective assessment by the reviewer that the methodology was so poor that it was not appropriate to make use of the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third reviewer was consulted when consensus could not be reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Synthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used meta-ethnography to synthesise qualitative studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [21] Meta-ethnography is particularly well-suited to provide new insights into understanding the experiences of stroke survivors and their caregivers as it provides a conceptual framework which surpasses simple aggregation of primary findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [15, 22] We adopted a paradigm neutral approach and synthesised studies based on their thematic rather than theoretical similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [23, 24]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our unit of analyses were themes identified by the authors of included studies (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  second order constructs reflecting authors interpretations of primary data, namely participants accounts which constituted first order constructs[15]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three groups of two reviewers (DMP, NA, VH, AVR, IW, RM, LL) read a subset of papers and recorded second order constructs with brief descriptions in the authors own words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contextual details were recorded (aim, country of origin, sample characteristics, study setting, data collection and analysis methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DMP and RM interpretatively read and compared second order constructs across the studies, and summarised them into second order constructs shared by the studies (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The summary included descriptions that had a meaning for all the studies [which included a relevant theme] ([15], p. 161).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then grouped the second order constructs into categories reflecting key characteristics of post-discharge care: (1) continuity of care, (2) access to services, (3) information and (4) quality of communication (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we developed third order constructs which represent our own explanation of why stroke survivors and caregivers had the experiences of primary care and community healthcare services that were represented in the second order constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the second order constructs as building blocks to develop these third order constructs and to make a line of argument synthesis in which we could consider how the findings might inform a sustainable model of long term support [16] The process was iterative and involved a consultation exercise with qualitative and healthcare researchers with expertise in primary care and stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified 3,667 potentially relevant articles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After excluding duplicates, title and abstract screening, 86 full reports were read in full and assessed for eligibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51 papers representing 51 unique studies including 496 participants (168 stroke survivors and 328 informal caregivers) were included in the final synthesis (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Study and participant characteristics are listed in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Almost half of studies (n = 20) included both stroke survivors and informal caregivers, and 17 studies included survivors from across the stroke continuum (within the first year after stroke n = 12, and beyond n = 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies originated from the UK (25), North America (12), Australia (8) and Scandinavia (5), and one study was from Iran.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [43] The majority of studies (n = 32) used interviews; eight used focus groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Critical_appraisal  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All but two studies[26, 66] scored 7 or above on the CASP Qualitative Checklist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None were assessed as being fatally flawed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Main quality limitations pertained to lack of consideration of the relationship between participant and researcher (19 studies), rigour of the data analyses (6 studies), and consideration of ethical issues (4 studies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 7 key papers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6, 25, 41, 42, 44, 61, 63]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Theoretical_standpoints  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Few studies specified a theoretical approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those which did, either adopted Grounded Theory[43, 48, 55, 64, 66] or phenomenology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [8, 29, 31, 32, 34, 60, 65] A variety of analytical methods were reported (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Synthesis_of_findings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stroke survivors and their caregivers feel abandoned because they have become marginalised by services and they do not have the knowledge or skills to re-engage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The marginalisation arises because of service passivity and misalignment of information provision with needs, which change with post-stroke recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The passivity of services was expressed as lack of continuity of care, including lack of (active) follow-up, limited (in scope and time) and delayed access to community services, as well as inadequate (too little and too general) information about stroke, recovery and healthcare services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We posit that this passivity also has a relational aspect where activating the support from healthcare professionals within the first year after stroke would increase patients ability to self-manage their chronic condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be achieved by providing timely and targeted information about stroke, available resources, and by regular follow-ups to foster supporting long-term relationships with healthcare professionals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active support from health care professionals would be expected to decrease over time as patients and caregivers become more self-reliant and better able to self-manage living with stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We focussed on post-stroke care delivered by primary and community health services after transfer from specialist services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that the third order construct of fluidity of need is also relevant to specialist care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the importance of matching information provision to patient and caregiver need.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified two key areas for potential service focused interventions to address patients and caregivers perceptions of marginalisation by the healthcare system after the discharge from the hospital and improve capacity for self-management: (1) increasing stroke specific health literacy by targeted and timely information provision, and (2) improving continuity of care and providing better access to community healthcare services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Information_provision_and_increasing_health_literacy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In alignment with previous work our synthesis identified deficiencies in information provision on several levels: content, format, and timing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [14] Information regarding stroke and recovery was also a common theme in previous reviews.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [13, 76, 77] Although qualitative longitudinal studies on the trajectory of stroke recovery are few,[75, 7880] the insights from such studies could help target both the timing and the content of information provision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [48, 63]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Health literacy encompasses personal skills, ability and motivation of individuals () to gain access to, understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health([81], p. 357).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses suggest that patients and caregivers want more information about stroke and secondary prevention, and take active efforts to find information for themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reviews have highlighted the interface between information provision and utilisation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [13, 82] Large volumes of sometimes conflicting information from multiple providers can impede understanding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What stroke survivors struggled with in our analyses and those by Gallacher et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [82] is access to sufficient information and the ability to appraise it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts directed towards helping patients identify sources of trustworthy information which are written in an accessible language and format would help increase stroke specific health literacy,[83] which in turn could support better self-management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third sector initiatives in a number of countries do aim to provide such resources,[8487] but our analyses indicate that many stroke survivors are not aware of them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Continuity_of_care_and_support_from_community_services  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lack of continuity of care and its negative consequences for patient care were reported in all previous qualitative reviews which focused on long-term problems,[77] treatment burden,[76] the impact of stroke and its relevance to the development and delivery of services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [13] Three types of continuity can be distinguished: (1) informational (using patient relevant information on stroke and personal circumstances to facilitate appropriate care), (2) management (coherent management of the chronic condition by multiple providers), and (3) relational (an ongoing therapeutic relationship[88]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unique to our review was a strong emphasis on the lack of follow-up either from a GP, community or specialist services; with patients and caregivers in nine studies (18%) reporting the need for an active follow-up or reassessment to ensure continuity of care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These two key areas for service interventions could be targeted at the patient, at the carer, or be dyad interventions directed at both patient and carer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [89] We did not review intervention studies in this meta-ethnography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reviews of evidence of interventions directed at the caregiver and at patient/carer dyads suggest that the former are more effective to improve carer outcome, and the latter to improve patient outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [89,90]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Strengths_and_limitations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To our knowledge this is the first systematic review on the experiences of stroke survivors and caregivers of primary care and community healthcare services with broad coverage of contexts, samples and study focus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using meta-ethnography we identified patients and caregivers perceived marginalisation by the passivity of healthcare services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we also identified a relational aspect between service activity and patient self-management thus providing a potential solution for how these perceptions could be addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have included studies from a variety of healthcare contexts (Northern America, UK, Australia, Northern Europe, Iran), involving municipal and rural settings, ethnic minorities,[37, 41, 52, 57, 58] and long-term stroke survivors (62% of the studies included survivors at least 1 year after stroke).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substantial degree of convergence of themes across different settings and samples suggests the transferability of these findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our meta-ethnography focused on experiences of a single patient and caregiver population within a more homogenous healthcare context (primary care and community healthcare services) than in previous reviews.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The homogeneity of healthcare contexts we studied facilitated meaningful comparisons and translations across studies in relation to post-discharge and long-term experience of care after stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [22] Despite methodological variety (Table 2), all studies included specific themes relevant to survivor and/or caregiver experiences of primary care and community healthcare services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Potential limitations of qualitative research such as limited generalisability and inability to provide firm answers are offset by the consistency of the findings across epistemological traditions, methodologies, countries and healthcare systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the included studies achieved good quality scores, many failed to provide sufficient contextual detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a minority included data on stroke severity, specific long-term impairments (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cognitive impairment, physical disability and aphasia), socio-economic status or ethnicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most studies employed a cross-sectional design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longitudinal studies could provide valuable insights on the temporality and intensity of healthcare needs after stroke relative to the trajectory of recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our synthesis was limited to reports in English.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only 2% of the studies were excluded based on language and studies from non-English speaking countries (in Northern Europe and Iran) were represented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our review included studies published up until June 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that we had over fifty studies, it is unlikely that further third order constructs would be identified by extending the review to the present timei.e it is likely that we achieved data saturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are not aware of major changes in the care offered to stroke patients and their carers in primary care in the last couple of years that might have led to new constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary care and community health care interventions which focus on improving active follow-up and information provision to patients and caregivers especially in the first year after stroke, could help improve patient self-management, increase stroke specific health literacy and thus mitigate the current perceptions of abandonment felt by many stroke survivors and their caregivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
