Oral Cooling and Carbonation Increase the Perception of Drinking and Thirst Quenching in Thirsty Adults  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluid ingestion is necessary for life, and thirst sensations are a prime motivator to drink.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is evidence of the influence of oropharyngeal stimulation on thirst and water intake in both animals and humans, but how those oral sensory cues impact thirst and ultimately the amount of liquid ingested is not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated which sensory trait(s) of a beverage influence the thirst quenching efficacy of ingested liquids and the perceived amount ingested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We deprived healthy individuals of liquid and food overnight ( greater than  12 hours) to make them thirsty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After asking them to drink a fixed volume (400 mL) of an experimental beverage presenting one or two specific sensory traits, we determined the volume ingested of additional plain, still, room temperature water to assess their residual thirst and, by extension, the thirst-quenching properties of the experimental beverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a second study, participants were asked to drink the experimental beverages from an opaque container through a straw and estimate the volume ingested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that among several oro-sensory traits, the perceptions of coldness, induced either by cold water (thermally) or by l-menthol (chemically), and the feeling of oral carbonation, strongly enhance the thirst quenching properties of a beverage in water-deprived humans (additional water intake after the 400 ml experimental beverage was reduced by up to 50%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When blinded to the volume of liquid consumed, individuals estimation of ingested volume is increased (~22%) by perceived oral cold and carbonation, raising the idea that cold and perhaps CO2 induced-irritation sensations are included in how we normally encode water in the mouth and how we estimate the quantity of volume swallowed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have implications for addressing inadequate hydration state in populations such as the elderly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sensation of thirst is a warning, a signal from interoceptors indicating the need to re-hydrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It plays a key role in the maintenance of body fluid homeostasis by motivating animals to seek and ingest water (as well as to ingest salt to retain the water).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is generally believed that drinking fluids diminishes thirst because it leads to rehydration and consequently reduced physiological thirst signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But thirst is quenched long before ingested liquids are absorbed and equilibrated with body fluids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oral sensations of drinking appear to participate in thirst quenching and the termination of water intake pre-absorptively [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cognitive projections of body hydration during drinking are important both to circumvent overhydration and ensure that physiological needs will be met.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, how ingested liquids are metered orally and what sensory cues are involved is largely unexplained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thirst can be stimulated physiologically by: small increases (12%) in plasma osmolality (pOsm), marked decreases in plasma volume (58% loss in body fluid volume), and manipulation of fluid regulatory hormones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During water deprivation and subsequent dehydration, both increased pOsm and decreased plasma volume may occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The restoration of total body water is controlled by a complex feedback system of inhibitory and excitatory osmoregulatory signals and hormones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A principal water regulatory system is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which acts on blood pressure and fluid balance both directly and indirectly via hormones, including aldosterone and arginine vasopressin (AVP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The released aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys, which in turn results in the retention of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And the released AVP acts on the kidneys to enhance the reabsorption of water at the nephron in order to dilute the increased osmolality and retain water [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the hormonally-induced reabsorption of water is not sufficient, then the sensation of thirst is stimulated to prime water seeking and drinking behavior and adequately decrease pOsm and increase plasma volume [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, above a certain osmotic threshold there is a linear relationship between the increases in pOsm, AVP concentration, and reported thirst [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationships among these three regulators of hydration have been exploited to demonstrate the existence of pre-absorptive mechanisms in the regulation of body fluid homeostasis [5,6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in humans a steep and sudden decrease of AVP concentration after drinking, concomitant with a reduction of thirst [7,8], is observed within minutes, well before ingested water has emptied from the stomach or pOsm returned to baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although those anticipatory responses are likely dependent on a combination of afferent inputs from oropharyngeal and gastric receptors, the rapid inhibition of thirst and AVP secretion appear to be principally a response to oropharyngeal sensory stimulation [9,10] because they are not observed when the oropharyngeal receptors are bypassed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the oral and pharyngeal regions appears to contribute to the accurate replacement of body fluids by metering the volume of ingested fluid, as demonstrated in dehydrated dogs, and subsequently in humans, which drink in proportion to water deficits, even if the ingested water is removed from their stomach [11,12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human studies have further shown that the rapid fall in plasma AVP observed after drinking (10 to 15 ml/kg) cannot be provoked when merely gargling [5], nor by the ingestion of very small quantities of water (1 ml/kg); rather full stimulation from drinking is required [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, sucking on ice chips for 30 min, in contrast to consuming an equivalent small volume of water (100 mL) at 25°C, causes a decrease in thirst and a prompt and sustained fall in plasma AVP [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, activation of cold signals from the oropharynx appears to play a role in pre-absorptive water intake signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is supported by the observation that dehydrated people have an increased desire for cold liquids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But the basis for the preference for cold beverages remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At equal volumes both room temperature and cold water would be expected to quench thirst equally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One explanation for why they do not could be that oral cooling is a signal of drinking [15], since water typically appears cool when ingested because it is usually several degrees below the temperature of the oral cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our study, we examined which sensory trait(s) and oral qualities influence levels of thirst, and how they impact the thirst quenching efficacy of ingested liquids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on demonstrating which oral-sensory cues influence projections of body hydration, influence volumes consumed, and affect the perception of the amount consumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cooling sensation and the bite of carbonation might help indicate the ingestion of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we asked participants to drink and then estimate the ingested volume of different beverages while they were unable to see or feel the beverages weight with their hand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three beverages were tested: RT water, cold water, and cold-carbonated water, at three different volumes (157.8, 251.5 and 400.9 mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each separate test, the time of completion was recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall participants underestimated their fluid consumption, especially for the greater volumes ingested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, they believed that they had consumed more fluid when the beverage was cold, and even more so when it was cold and carbonated by about 22% more, compared to the estimated volume ingested when the same sized beverage was at RT (Fig 3A, upper panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post hoc analysis volume estimated x experimental beverage using Fisher LSD method were performed for each level of volume offered ((157.8, 251.5 and 400.9 mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 400.9 mL, main effect of cold water compared to RT water was p = 0.29 and main effect of cold-carbonated water was p = 0.006.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The time required to finish a beverage tended to track the beverages perceived volume; participants finished the RT samples faster than the cold samples (Fig 3A, lower panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, therefore, possible that total time spent drinking, rather than the sensations of cold or carbonation, influenced the perception and judgment of how much fluid had been ingested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined this question by repeating the study with both RT and cold water, but we asked the participants to drink the beverages at specified rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drinking rate was established by asking participants to sip once and swallow at each beat of a metronome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fast rate was set at 20 beats per minute (bpm), which dictates one sip every three seconds, and the slow rate was set to half that speed, 10 bpm, or one sip every six seconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3B shows that the rate of drinking the beverage had no impact on the estimation of how much water was ingested either at RT or when cold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [These data also confirm that volume estimations were greater when drinking cold water compared to RT water even when sipping at fixed rates (top panel)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the role of oropharyngeal sensory signals on thirst quenching, we first determined the respective efficacies of several sensory trait(s) commonly manipulated in beverages, including cold, on thirst reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preponderance of data on thirst quenching from beverages in humans has been subjective, based upon ratings of refreshment or thirst level, rather than objectively measuring volumes consumed [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirst quenching judgments are estimations of the actual thirst-reducing ability of a drink [19]; they may be greatly influenced by other factors, such as beverage flavor, palatability, and demand characteristics of the task, such as preconceived ideas and social norms about which beverage attributes should be thirst quenching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed our experiment to indicate thirst reduction operationally as a decrease in the volume of plain RT water consumed following the ingestion of a fixed-volume, experimental beverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in order to compare the thirst quenching capacities of different experimental beverages directly, all tests of thirst involved the offering of the same test beverage: an excess of unflavored, still (uncarbonated), room-temperature water to participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume ingested of additional water assesses their residual thirst and, by extension, the thirst-quenching properties of the experimental beverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method enables us to compare our results directly with the literature on thirst quenching in non-verbal animals involving similar operational experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first examined the effect of cold temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that participants drank significantly less RT water from the jug after a previous cold water beverage than after a RT water beverage, demonstrating that cold water reduced thirst more effectively than did the RT water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirm the effect of cold stimulation on water intake in dehydrated humans, and are in agreement with studies showing greater reward value of a cold drink compared to a room temperature drink in water-deprived humans [20,21] and non-human animals [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thirsty humans often prefer beverages that are both cold and carbonated including: mineral waters, seltzer, sodas, and beers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is, however, no clear explanation for why this behavior is so common.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, investigated the effect of carbonation on thirst quenching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that like cold, carbonation enhances the thirst quenching properties of the beverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, carbonation further reduces thirst beyond the effects of cold water when comparing cold water with cold, carbonated water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the effect of carbonation on thirst satiation is due, at least in part, to gastric filling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But dissolved CO2 also elicits oral pungency [23], a very slight sourness, and has been shown to enhance the perception of cool sensations [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sensations, as well as the lower pH of the commercial carbonated water (pH = 4.0 vs 5.4 for the still water), could be involved in the enhanced thirst quenching properties of the beverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the lower pH/slight sourness of carbonated water affected thirst, we compared the effect of a matched-acidity (5 mM citric acid, pH = 4.0), cold water beverage to a plain, cold water beverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mild acidification at this level did not by itself appear to reduce thirst beyond the thirst quenching effects of a cold beverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the enhanced effect of cold, carbonated water on thirst quenching is not solely due to its lower pH or mild sourness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result does not preclude possible effects of acids on thirst reduction at higher concentrations (lower pH), but it suggests that gastric gas filling, perceived carbonation bite in the oral cavity, and possible enhanced cool perception elicited by CO2 are central to its effect on thirst reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbonation and cold sensations are both mediated in part by pain/thermal receptors (nociceptors), especially transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, such as TRPM8, TRPV1, TRPA1 and TRPC5 [2527].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that those sensations have an additive effect on perceived coldness, which further enhances thirst quenching, as observed in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this hypothesis, Green [24] demonstrated that CO2 enhanced the perception of cool in the oral cavity from low temperature stimuli, and that low temperature stimuli increased the perceived irritation of CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further examine the contribution of cold-sensitive oropharyngeal receptors in thirst, we investigated the effect of chemically-induced oral cold sensations on thirst reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used l-menthols ability to stimulate and sensitize the sensory cold receptor TRPM8 to test the hypothesis that a beverage illusorily perceived as cool, but physically at RT, quenches thirst more effectively than a RT beverage that is perceived to be at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that people sensitive to the cooling effect of menthol drank less water from the jug when the menthol pretreatment was applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, thirst reduction can be enhanced by perceived oral coldness whether elicited thermally or chemically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that sensations from cold and carbonated water improve the thirst quenching properties of a beverage by increasing the sensory signals normally associated with drinking water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analogy, a parallel process has been demonstrated for breathing, in which people can hold their breath significantly longer if they inhale cool air versus warm air [28], presumably because nasal and pharyngeal evaporative cooling is a correlated sensory cue to the volume of inspired air [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, cooling sensations may help indicate both the volume of inspired air, as well as the volume of water ingested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we asked participants to estimate the ingested volume of different beverages when blind to the actual volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that judgments of the volume ingested were increased when the beverage was cold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perceived volume was further increased when the beverage was cold and carbonated ( greater than  20% increase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here again it is possible that gastric filling by CO2 impacts the higher estimation of volume ingested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that cold sensations and perhaps the bite of carbonation, which have sensory similarities to very cold water, are integrated sensory cues that inform the inferred volume of ingested water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Water at temperatures well below oral temperature (~0 to 33°C) is perceived as cool or cold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And the lower the water temperature, the more biting a cold beverage will appear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CO2 is perceived as biting (or irritating) because it passes directly through cell membranes and acidifies tissues by forming carbonic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue irritation from CO2 is not injurious; it mimics the pH changes associated with tissue damage, but does not actually harm tissue [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CO2 in beverages also enhances the perception of cool from low temperature liquids [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we believe CO2 increases the perception of drinking by enhancing the cool and biting signals of cold water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, we conclude, is why cold-carbonated beverages are more thirst quenching than room temperature-still water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Related to this, Michou et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  recently demonstrated that cold temperatures and carbonation modulate water swallowing in humans [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we demonstrated that the pre-exposure to l-menthol which chemically sensitizes TRPM8 cold receptors, among other TRP channels, can quench thirst, even when the beverage was at RT and the sensation of cool water was illusory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the perception of drinking water when thirsty appears to be mediated in part by cold, mildly irritating oral sensations, which, in turn, directly influence water intake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, these sensory manipulations not only influence thirst, but also result in the conscious perception that ingested water volume is greater when the water is either cold or cold-carbonated, irrespective of the rate at which it is ingested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results are consistent with previous studies of the influence of cold sensations on drinking and licking in animals, which show that thirsty animals will strive not only to lick cold water over room temperature water, but even to lick streams of cold air or even solid pieces of cold metal that provide no fluids [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies expand this idea both to include carbonation sensation that influences cold perception and to rule out strong influences from sour taste or acidity, sweetness, and astringency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we show that cold and carbonation sensations alter the volume perception of participants, so that they believe they have ingested more water, than if they had ingested the same volume of room temperature, un-carbonated water, reinforcing the idea that thirst is quenched, in the short term, by the perception of drinking water, not necessarily by how much is consumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations could explain the ubiquity of cold, carbonated beverages throughout the world, and are consistent with the idea that these beverages quench thirst more efficiently and are, therefore, more rewarding to thirsty people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also have implications for groups who are known for clinical underhydration, such as laborers, soldiers, and the elderly, possibly due to their ignoring or cognitively mishandling important sensory cues that guide thirst and its quenching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
