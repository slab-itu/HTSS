Fine particles in homes of predominantly low-income families with children and smokers: Key physical and behavioral determinants to inform indoor-air-quality interventions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Children are at risk for adverse health outcomes from occupant-controllable indoor airborne contaminants in their homes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are needed to design residential interventions for reducing low-income children's pollutant exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using customized air quality monitors, we continuously measured fine particle counts (0.5 to 2.5 microns) over a week in living areas of predominantly low-income households in San Diego, California, with at least one child (under age 14) and at least one cigarette smoker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed retrospective interviews on home characteristics, and particle source and ventilation activities occurring during the week of monitoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explored the relationship between weekly mean particle counts and interview responses using graphical visualization and multivariable linear regression (base sample n = 262; complete cases n = 193).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found associations of higher weekly mean particle counts with reports of indoor smoking of cigarettes or marijuana, as well as with frying food, using candles or incense, and house cleaning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower particle levels were associated with larger homes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe an association between lower mean particle counts and reports of opening windows, using kitchen exhaust fans, or other ventilation activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings about sources of fine airborne particles and their mitigation can inform future studies that investigate more effective feedback on residential indoor-air-quality and better strategies for reducing occupant exposures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This article explores physical characteristics of residences and common occupant behaviors (related to air-particle generation and mitigation) that may influence weekly fine airborne particles (0.5 to 2.5 micrometers) in homes of predominantly low-income families containing one or more smokers and at least one young child.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-income families may be at more risk for particulate matter exposure from smoking and other indoor air contaminants [1,2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indoor levels of fine particles in residences are derived from indoor sources or from infiltration of outdoor particles, and can be controlled by occupants [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over 85% of peoples time, on average, is spent indoors and mostly at home [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a seminal review of particles in homes, Wallace et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (1996) reported smoking and cooking to be important indoor sources [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Household occupants can experience short and long-term health effects associated with acute and cumulative exposure to indoor airborne particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The health consequences are especially important for children whose lungs are not fully developed and who breathe around three times more air per kilogram of body weight than adults [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fine particle pollution in outdoor air is monitored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as part of its PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard to protect public health [7]; particle pollution has been associated with respiratory and cardiovascular effects, and increased morbidity and mortality [811].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particulate matter is also a commonly-used indicator of secondhand tobacco smoke [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acute and chronic detrimental health effects of exposure to tobacco smoke are well-documented [13,14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the level of fine airborne particles indicates if other combustion-generated pollutants (e.g., volatile organics in cooking emissions or incense emissions) are present and provides information on the effectiveness of pollutant removal mechanisms (e.g., natural or forced ventilation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of fine particles in residences depends on emission source activity, the physical characteristics of the residence, and removal activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Research is needed on interventions for private homes that promote strategies to avoid or reduce indoor air pollution from tobacco and other sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By understanding source and mitigation effects for households with different physical characteristics, we can optimize interventions by identifying specific occupant-modifiable behaviors and characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While models [15] and small-scale field studies (e.g., Ott et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2003 [16]) have established physics-based theory and the broad impact of different occupant activities on fine particle levels in homes, empirical data from a large sample are needed to confirm influential factors in homes with varying family types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study was motivated by a need to develop effective interventions targeting children exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) in homes (pilot study described by Klepeis et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2013 [17]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported by Rosen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2014) in a meta-analysis of 30 child-SHS intervention studies, while some past intervention studies (primarily based on counseling) have shown moderate impact, improved interventions (e.g., with feedback on SHS) are needed to reduce children's SHS exposure [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, some intervention researchers have reported on smoke particle levels and exposures in the home, removal rates, alternate sources of fine particles, or the physical dwelling characteristics (e.g., [19,20]), or provide initial evidence that SHS interventions incorporating feedback on SHS levels can reduce particle count measures and presumably child exposures [17,21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continued refinement of real-time instruments and their application in real-time interventions may better prevent or reduce SHS exposures and result in more smoke-free environments [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since SHS is the central intervention interest for the present data set and future studies, our investigation focuses initially on levels of particles contributed by smoking, primarily cigarettes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure to third hand smoke (THS), which occurs by direct contact with surfaces or dust contaminated with SHS emissions, or by inhalation of compounds off-gassing from walls, carpets, drapes etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [22], may also be targeted by interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Few prior air monitoring studies have considered comprehensive source or ventilation-related determinants of particles in homes or measured fine particles in a large sample of low-income homes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study by Urso et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2015) of many building factors and their association with size-differentiated particle levels in 60 mostly non-smoking (70%) households in Italy found that sealing doors and windows, using kitchen air-exhaust systems, building density around the home, and larger home volume lowered levels of fine particles [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main determinants of elevated indoor fine particles were tobacco smoking, burning fireplace wood, the number of occupants, and time spent cleaning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baxter et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2007) measured samples of integrated (filter and pump) fine particulate matter in 43 low socioeconomic-status (SES) homes in the Boston Area, confirming that cooking and stove usages, along with resuspension activities (e.g., dusting, sweeping, vacuuming), contribute to indoor levels, with occupant activities driving indoor levels more than housing characteristics [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of large monitoring studies in Europe, the U.S., and Canada confirm the general importance of tobacco smoking, cooking, cleaning, and outdoor levels as particle determinants [2531].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The objective of the present study is to provide new findings on fine particle levels in at-risk homes that will better inform efforts to develop and implement particle-reduction interventions, especially for SHS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unique advantages of the present study are: (1) its focus on predominantly low-income household residents, who are likely to be at significant risk to smoking and other indoor contaminants; (2) a relatively large analytic sample size (n = 262); (3) interview data for many different types of smoking and other particle-generating activities, ventilation, and home size; and (4) week-long continuous monitoring data, which cover weekday and weekend activity cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features of our study allow us to examine a wide range of potential fine particle sources (e.g., tobacco, marijuana, incense, e-cigarettes), home sizes, potential behaviors (e.g., fan use, indoor/outdoor smoking) in predominantly low-income homes that may affect air quality and may be incorporated into feedback provided to intervention participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data_source  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data for this study were from participants enrolled in a randomized controlled intervention trial designed to reduce secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure in children by making use of real-time feedback on particle levels (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01634334).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present paper is limited to investigation of particle levels and their determinants in participants homes during a baseline period for combined treatment and control groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future papers will examine the overall outcome of the intervention trial and the impact of particle feedback, including differential levels by study condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study enrolled 298 households (one adult and one child participant per household), who were recruited during 20122015 from multiple sources, including Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Special Supplemental Nutrition Programs sites in San Diego Country, community tabling events, health care professional referrals, local organizations, and advertisement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eligibility criteria included: parent/guardian 18 years or older; at least one child under 14 years of age in the household; at least one smoker living in the household who smoked inside or outside the home; no plans to move outside the County within 4 months; and speaks English or Spanish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The San Diego State University Institutional Review Board approved the procedures for this study (IRB Study Number 770080).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One adult participant in each household signed an informed consent agreement, whereupon the adult and the youngest child in the home were enrolled as participants in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first 36 homes enrolled comprised our pilot study sample and participants in these homes were not administered the final smoking-related questions; the pilot homes were excluded from our analysis, leaving an analytic base sample of 262 households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The participant characteristics for the analytic sample are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enrolled parents (EP) were 95% female, 38% Hispanic, 27% Non-Hispanic White, and 67% with ages between 25 and 40; 40% were employed; and 36% had no education beyond high school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enrolled children (EC) were 48% female, 49% Hispanic, 19% Non-Hispanic White, and averaged 4.2 (SD = 3.7) years of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median categorical annual family income was $20,000 to $30,000 with 39% of families having income less than $20,000 and 81% of families having income less than $50,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reference, according to the US Censor Bureau (2015), the poverty thresholds for households with 3 to 6 people and 1 to 5 children are roughly in the range of $20,000 to $30,000 per year [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_collection_and_measures_of_interest  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This article focuses on the first week of baseline data collection, which spanned the time between home Visit 1 and Visit 2, roughly 7 days apart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected data on the physical characteristics of the residence, emission source activity, ventilation activity, and continuous particle counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During Visit 1, trained research assistants used Bosch Laser Distance Measurers (DLR130K, Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany) to measure the length, width, and height of the room containing the monitor from which we calculated the room volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical characteristics (Table 2) were obtained from interviews and extracted from detailed floor plans drawn by trained staff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At Visit 1, a customized Dylos DC1700 Air Quality Monitor (Dylos Corporation, Riverside, CA USA) was placed in homes to continuously measure counts per 0.01 cubic feet of particles with diameters between 0.5 and 2.5 micrometers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described by Klepeis et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2013 [17] for a similar instrument used in an SHS intervention, the Dylos unit had expanded data storage, special firmware, wireless connectivity, and lights and sounds triggered by particle level thresholds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lights and sounds [33] were disabled for the baseline data used in the present analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monitors recorded 10-second average counts (derived from 1-second average readings in internal memory) in the room closest to the usual cigarette smoking location (as reported by the participants).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monitors were placed at least 3 feet from the floor and a minimum of 1 foot from the nearest wall to provide consistent air flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The feasibility of using Dylos-brand monitors to measure fine particle levels in homes or under controlled conditions has been demonstrated [17,3440].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fresh emissions, Klepeis et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2013) and Dacunto et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2015) reported reasonable agreement between the Dylos and mass particle concentrations of tobacco smoke measured every minute using calibrated industry-standard particle-mass-measurement instruments (DustTrak and SidePak, TSI, Inc., Shoreview, MN) [17,40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Semple et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2013) showed a trend for long-term SidePak versus Dylos measurements in 34 homes [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the Dylos factory-calibrated monitors provide acceptable unit-to-unit consistency and, while their accuracy for measuring absolute fine particle mass concentrations for different sources is low, they are still useful for providing broad feedback in behavioral applications or personal awareness activities, and for investigating relative measures of particle counts within and between homes, as in the current application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During Visit 2, trained staff administered a computer-assisted face-to-face interview to gather data about behaviors during the preceding 7-day period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Key questions were asked about the smoking habits of each household member, other particle-generating behaviors (e.g., burning candles, using a wood fireplace), and ventilation activities (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were provided between $20 and $35 (modified during the study with IRB approval) for participating in the interview.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For data analyses, responses to questions about particle generating behaviors and ventilation activities were dichotomizedeffectively measuring whether the activity occurred on any day during the last 7 days (0 days versus  greater than  0 days; or 0 times versus  greater than  0 times for smoking behaviors only).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure was used to facilitate interpretation of regression coefficients for variables originally measured using different scales (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dependent variable used for analysis in this study was weekly mean particle levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each home, all available particle data from the week-long period prior to the baseline interview (e.g., from Monday to Monday) were averaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All homes included in the final analytic sample for regression modeling provided data for least 5 days; there was one home that contributed only 5 days of data, 3 homes that contributed 6 days of data, 145 that contributed 7 days of data, and 44 homes that contributed 8 days of data (due to delays in scheduling Visit 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used conventional techniques in our analysis approach to provide an overview of the data to identify influential correlates, and provide both graphical (model-free) and model-based indicators of association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach consisted of three components: (1) descriptive statistics of interview variables for indoor versus no reported indoor smoking; (2) graphical visualization of weekly mean particle count distributions as a function of interview variables; and (3) a statistical model-building approach employing linear regression to identify influential variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We accomplished all graphical and statistical analysis using the R programming environment [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of the 298 households enrolled in the larger trial, the first 36 pilot homes enrolled were not asked questions about key particle generating behaviors related to smoking, leaving 262 (88%) homes eligible for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphical analyses were conducted using all available data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See S1 and S2 Tables with sample sizes for graphical analysis subgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that each stage of statistical model building was conducted on the same sample, we used a complete-case analysis, whereby homes were included that provided data for all potential correlates that were significantly related to mean 7-day particle levels at an alpha level of 0.20 (from bivariate analysis of variables shown in Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure resulted in a final modeling sample of 193 homes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Table 3 shows the 193 homes included in the statistical analysis split by indoor cigarette-smoking status, which is a key variable of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, they had an average of 2.6 bedrooms, 1.6 bathrooms and were mostly one story (mean (SD) number of levels = 1.1 (0.4)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 44 (22.8%) homes reported at least one household member smoking at least one cigarette indoors in the 7-days prior to interview.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of the number of doors leading outside, none of the home characteristics of families with and without self-reported indoor cigarette smoking differed significantly (ps  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homes without indoor cigarette smoking reported indoor smoking of cigars (1.3%), hookah (0.8%), electronic cigarettes (14.1%), marijuana (10.1%), and other drugs (0.7%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exceptions of cigar, pipe, electronic cigarette, and marijuana smoking, the 7-day prevalence of all particle generating behaviors did not differ significantly by indoor cigarette smoking status (ps  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly all homes reported opening a window (95.3%) or opening a door (96.9%) for ventilation purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most homes (60.1%) reported using an exhaust fan in their kitchen and 8.3% of homes used an air purifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no significant differences between homes with and without indoor cigarette smoking with respect to ventilation activities (ps  0.05), except the use of central air conditioning which was higher among homes without indoor cigarette smoking (25.5% vs. 6.8%; p = 0.030).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Statistical_results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas graphical visualization provides a data overview for observing raw relationships, sample sizes, and distributional features, model-based analysis offers a way to quantitatively confirm and summarize important findings, and to control for the influence of other variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simple regression results are shown in Table 4 in which we identify the variables that we used in the step-wise model-building procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multivariable linear regression results for the final model, including all variables identified from model-building, are shown in Table 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The statistical results for particle counts with home-size-related variables (Table 5) confirm our graphical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each additional exterior door was associated with a 7.7% ([e-0.081]*100) reduction in geometric mean 1-week particle counts ( = -0.08, p = 0.034), after adjusting for all other correlates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each additional bathroom was associated with a 22.1% reduction in geometric mean 1-week particle counts ( = -0.25, p = 0.003).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no statistically significant associations between geometric mean particle levels and room volume or number of rooms after adjustment for all other variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarly, the modeling results for particle sources agreed broadly with our graphical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistically significant increases in indoor particle counts were observed among homes that reported indoor cigarette or marijuana smoking, burning incense and/or candles, frying food in oil, or cleaning the house by vacuuming, dusting or sweeping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smoking cigarettes indoors (compared to not smoking cigarettes indoors) was associated with a 56.8% ([e0.451]*100) increase in geometric mean particle counts ( = 0.45, p less_than 0.001) while smoking marijuana indoors was associated with a 68.2% increase ( = 0.52, p less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no statistically significant associations between geometric mean particle levels and burning food after adjustment for all other variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homes that reported cleaning in the last 7 days had 68.2% higher 1-week geometric mean particle counts than homes that did not report cleaning ( = 0.52, p less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frying with oil was also associated with increased geometric mean particle levels with any indoor frying being associated with a 31.0% increase in geometric mean particle levels compared to homes that did not report frying food with oil ( = 0.27, p = 0.020).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From our tests that explored central air (p = 0.94), air purifier (p = 0.45), exhaust fan in kitchen (p = 0.13), window fan or window air conditioner (p = 0.10), open a window (p = 0.11), and open an exterior door (p = 0.96) as effect modifiers of the association between reported indoor smoking and mean particle levels, none were statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively small number of homes in subgroup analyses is one possible explanation for the null results, particularly for tests of using an exhaust fan in kitchen, using a window fan or window air conditioner, and opening windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Additional_tests  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From our tests that explored ventilation activities as effect modifiers of the association between reported indoor smoking and mean particle levels, we found that none of the 6 activities were statistically significant (ps less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another suite of tests comparing homes that were included in statistical analyses to homes that were omitted due to complete-case-only analysis, we found no differences for indoor smoking or any other indoor-particle-generating activities (see S3 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also did not observe statistically significant differences in ventilation activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small, yet statistically significant, differences were identified in several variables related to home size, particularly with room volume, the number of levels, rooms, and bedrooms, and with the proportion of home types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all differences, the 69 homes omitted from the complete cases analysis sample were, on average, larger and had disproportionately higher other home types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This article explores how indoor air quality is affected by occupant activities and home characteristics for a large number of smoking households with children under 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the viewpoint of epidemiologists, large samples of participants are desired to draw population-level conclusions and develop scalable interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for air-quality-targeted studies using air monitoring instrumentation, large studies are hindered due to the expense of hardware and quality-assured deployment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study has made successful use of an inexpensive, unobtrusive monitor that was deployed for long periods in nearly 300 homes (see Klepeis et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2013 [17] for details on the monitoring equipment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible to report week-long airborne particle measurements for a large sample that is expected to be representative of at-risk, low-income families with young children in San Diego and similar metropolitan regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This work provides a resource to those who may be undertaking air quality interventions for tobacco smoke or other pollutant sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the confluence of public health, exposure dynamics, and building science, it contributes new data to inform future air quality interventions about fundamental driving forces for air quality (and particles in particular).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This studys findings may be used to develop new hypotheses and inform future epidemiological and health studies in developing effective interventions for indoor air pollution, especially for tobacco-related risks for children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results may provide insight and training to those involved in air-quality interventions, by summarizing influential variables in a large sample of homes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smoking, whether cigarettes or marijuana, is a major source for this study population, whereas electronic cigarettes are not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger samples of more specialized sources, such as cigars, pipes, and hookahs, are required to draw conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with expectations and prior studies, outdoor smoking is clearly protective in terms of mitigating indoor particle levels and larger home and room size can be associated with lower levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our results indicate that cooking with oil, independent of whether food is burned, is associated with elevated particle counts and that cleaning by vacuuming/dusting/sweeping is also associated with elevated particle counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Relationships between air quality indicators (like airborne particles) and physical characteristics of homes or occupant behaviors are vital, but knowledge on the intensity of emissions and exposures is also important in providing feedback to intervention participants and broadly gauging the seriousness of health risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Dylos monitor and other real-time particle monitors are not best-suited for estimating absolute mass particle concentration due to differential sensitivity of the monitor to source types and removal rates [40,61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While mass levels are typically assessed using a gold standard filter-and-pump approach, the Dylos may still be used as an approximate indication of the magnitude of indoor levels and occupants exposures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, weekly mean particle counts for our sample ranged from 556 to 28,400 counts per 0.01 cubic feet (particles 0.5 to 2.5 microns in diameter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fresh cigarette smoking emissions, incense, and some types of cooking, Dacunto et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2015) reported mean count-to-mass conversion factors of roughly 0.02 to 0.03, giving weekly mean concentrations for our sample that range from a low of 11 to 16 micrograms per meter cubed (g/m3) to a high of 568 to 852 g/m3 [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the assumption of fresh emissions may overestimate the peak mass levels for homes with source emissions that may take hours to decay to background levels (e.g., see reported experiment by Ott et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2003 [16]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is clear that indoor sources such as cigarettes, marijuana, and incense are associated with substantially-elevated particle levels that may pose a risk to health, and Dylos measurements can be used as reliable feedback to intervention participants to indicate particles rising to concerning levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low ambient-level particles are in the range of 10 g/m3, which corresponds roughly to Dylos particle counts of 300 to 500.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 24-hour U.S.EPA standard for fine particles is only 35 g/m3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the mean cigarette-long levels observed in moving cars, with the AC on, can exceed 400 g/m3 [62] and mean levels in smoky areas of casinos have been reported at 63 g/m3 [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reference levels, and similar ones for other sources, may give intervention participants a sense for how high the particle levels may be in their home.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Future studies should examine marijuana use and its impact on indoor air quality in low-income homes with smokers, and consider this source explicitly in air-quality or environmental interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of our central and new findings based on modeling and graphical plots is that marijuana use is associated with significantly higher particle counts for both indoor cigarette smokers and outdoor cigarette smokers even after accounting for home characteristics, other particle generating behaviors, and ventilation activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marijuana was the most commonly-used illicit drug among people aged 12 and older in 2013 and use is on the rise from 5.8% in 2002 to 7.5% in 2013 (SAMHSA, 2014).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the U.S., reported unintentional marijuana exposure to children aged 9 years and under to the poison control center increased by 30% from 2005 to 2011 partially due to legalization of marijuana use for medical and recreational purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  California, where medical marijuana use is legal, has the fifth highest reported exposure (4.9 per 100,000) in the U.S. [64].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Symptoms of ingestion or passive inhalation exposure among children under 5 years of age include lethargy, bradycardia, somnolence, and sleepiness [65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Wang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2016) found that brief exposures to secondhand marijuana smoke impaired vascular endothelial function in rats, suggesting that secondhand marijuana smoke may have cardiotoxic effects similar to those from secondhand tobacco smoke [66].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Our study has several limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of home was determined by proxy measurements (number of rooms, doors, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rather than direct measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measurements of ventilation and source activity were determined from broad interview questions, rather than more detailed time-activity or other objective measures, which may have limited our ability to see effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency of specific ventilation measures in a home and the coupling of ventilation activity with specific sources are expected to be important factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data on indoor versus outdoor smoking behavior was based on report at an initial interview rather than direct observation by trained observers or sensor objective measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific data on the number of daily cigarettes and the duration of smoking were not gathered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporting of indoor smoking and other sensitive information such as marijuana use and other drug use may be underreported due to social-desirability bias and other biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a subset of homes in this study, we did not have authorization to ask questions about marijuana and other illicit drug use, and therefore those homes were omitted from statistical model building, but included in graphical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied a base sample of 262 homes that excluded the first 36 pilot homes and was further constrained for certain analysis due to missing data on some variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these potential biases, we observed important effects of cigarette and marijuana use on particle counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under-reporting marijuana smoking and indoor cigarette smoking would likely attenuate effect sizes, indicating that our results are probably underestimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the proximity of sources to the Dylos monitor was not recorded and could have impacted the weekly mean particle counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More proximate sources could have resulted in higher counts relative to a well-mixed emissions condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results confirm the importance of smoking, cooking, and cleaning in the elevation of indoor particle levels, as reported by other investigators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report new findings that marijuana may lead to as comparatively large an increase in weekly particle levels as cigarettes and deserves focused future study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smokers who do not smoke indoors demonstrated better indoor air quality relative to homes where smoking occurs indoors, a finding that is consistent with engineering principles but also manifests in population-level data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broadly-assessed ventilation activities did not appear to have a mitigating effect on indoor air particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study illustrates how inexpensive air quality instrumentation can be successfully deployed in large samples for epidemiological and behavioral studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies of air quality in at-risk populations may use our results to better focus interventions, to consider which key influential variables to include on interviews and questionnaires, and to design sampling procedures to include sub-groups of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
