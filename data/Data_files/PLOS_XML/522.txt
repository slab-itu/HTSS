Spiclypeus shipporum gen. et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., a Boldly Audacious New Chasmosaurine Ceratopsid (Dinosauria: Ornithischia) from the Judith River Formation (Upper Cretaceous: Campanian) of Montana, USA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study reports on a new ceratopsid, Spiclypeus shipporum gen et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., from the lower Coal Ridge Member of the Judith River Formation in Montana, USA, which dates to ~76 Ma (upper Campanian).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The species is distinguished by rugose dorsal contacts on the premaxillae for the nasals, laterally projecting postorbital horncores, fully fused and anteriorly curled P1 and P2 epiparietals, and a posterodorsally projecting P3 epiparietal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotype specimen is also notable for its pathological left squamosal and humerus, which show varied signs of osteomyelitis and osteoarthritis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the postorbital horncores of Spiclypeus closely resemble those of the contemporaneous Ceratops, the horncores of both genera are nevertheless indistinguishable from those of some other horned dinosaurs, including Albertaceratops and Kosmoceratops; Ceratops is therefore maintained as a nomen dubium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cladistic analysis recovers Spiclypeus as the sister taxon to the clade Vagaceratops + Kosmoceratops, and appears transitional in the morphology of its epiparietals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of Spiclypeus adds to the poorly known dinosaur fauna of the Judith River Formation, and suggests faunal turnover within the formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ceratopsidae is a clade of megaherbivorous dinosaurs that arose during the Late Cretaceous and rapidly diversified in Asia and North America to become one of the most speciose dinosaur groups of their time [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ceratopsids are most easily distinguished by their horned crania and expansive parietosquamosal frills, which were typically ornamented for display [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two subfamilies, Centrosaurinae and Chasmosaurinae, primarily differ in the morphology of the horns and frill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Centrosaurines usually possess an enlarged nasal horncore or boss, abbreviated postorbital horncores, and a short and elaborately ornamented frill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chasmosaurines typically have a short nasal horncore, elongate postorbital horncores, and a long frill with more conservative ornamentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first recognized ceratopsid, Ceratops montanus [3], was found in terrestrial deposits of the Campanian Judith River Formation (JRF) of Montana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Described on the basis of a pair of postorbital horncores and an occipital condyle, the species has long been considered a nomen dubium, owing to the non-diagnostic nature of these elements [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many other named ceratopsids from the JRF (e.g., Dysganus bicarinatus, D. encaustus, D. haydenanius, D. peiganus, Monoclonius crassus, M. recurvicornis, M. fissus, M. sphenocerus) are also considered taxonomically invalid [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presently, five valid ceratopsid species are recognized from the JRF: the centrosaurines Avaceratops [4] and Albertaceratops [5], and the chasmosaurines Judiceratops [6], Medusaceratops [7], and Mercuriceratops [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time-equivalent Belly River Group in Alberta has been sampled over a similar period of time, yielding ~14 ceratopsid species [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ceratopsid fauna of the JRF is therefore comparatively poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we report on a new chasmosaurine from the JRF, distinguished, in part, by the dorsolaterally projecting postorbital horncores and conjointly fused, anteriorly curled epiossifications straddling the midline of the frill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotype exhibits several chronic pathologies, most notably on the squamosal and humerus, which attest to the resilience of the animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new species clarifies the evolutionary acquisition of the anteriorly curling epiossifications in the closely related Kosmoceratops and Vagaceratops, and further informs our understanding of both the biostratigraphy of the JRF and faunal provincialism on the Late Cretaceous continent of Laramidia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The holotype specimen (CMN 58071) was collected from terrestrial deposits within the lower Coal Ridge Member of the Upper Cretaceous JRF [10] (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The host stratum is mudstone, with abundant plant fragments throughout, and a siderite nodule zone at the top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mudstone is interpreted as an overbank deposit in a floodplain environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured section at the quarry (Fig 1B) spans ~11 m of outcrop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lithologies within the measured section, including bentonitic mudstones, highly carbonaceous layers, and layers with high concentrations of siderite nodules, are consistent with the transgressive alluvial suite described by Rogers [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The contact between the JRF and the overlying Bearpaw Formation is exposed 2 km east of the quarry, ~80 m higher in section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regionally, this contact dates to 75.21 ± 0.12 Ma, based on 40Ar/39Ar dating of a bentonite layer that occurs ~5 m above the contact near reference section 91-JRT-12 of Rogers et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Judith River-Claggett formational contact is ~95 m below the quarry, based on nearby well log data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mid-Judith discontinuity [10], which is interpreted to coincide with the onset of transgression of the Bearpaw Sea, occurs 89 m above the Judith River-Claggett formational contact in reference section 91-JRT-8, ~27 km NNE of the quarry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This places the discontinuity at least 6 m below the quarry, in the subsurface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40Ar/39Ar dating of a bentonite layer 10 m below the discontinuity, in reference section 91-JRT-8, yields an age of 76.24 Ma ± 0.18 [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMN 58071 is therefore bracketed between ~76.24 Ma (mid-Judith discontinuity) and ~75.21 Ma (Judith-Bearpaw formational contact).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The close proximity of the holotype to the mid-Judith discontinuity suggests that the specimen is much closer to 76 Ma in age (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMN 58071 is ~3 million years younger than the fauna at Kennedy Coulee, which includes the chasmosaurines Medusaceratops lokii and Judiceratops tigris ([67, 23]; see [10] for recalibrated dates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotype is approximately equivalent in age to the lower portion (Megaherbivore Assemblage Zone 1) of the Dinosaur Park Formation [24, 25], which includes the ceratopsids Centrosaurus apertus and Mojoceratops perifania.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison with radiometric dates from the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah indicates that CMN 57081 is also approximately equivalent in age to Kosmoceratops richardsoni, Utahceratops gettyi, and their associated fauna [2628].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The holotype was badly broken and scattered prior to burial (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger bones, including the squamosals, parietal, and ilium, were broken into several fragments, which were discovered separated from each other by up to 2 m during excavation of the quarry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many rib fragments exhibit oblique and/or transverse fractures, with sawtooth edges (sensu Shipman [29]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the interpretation that the elements still retained their collagen, and were broken prior to fossilization [30, 31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two tyrannosaurid teeth were found in the quarry, and parallel scratches that are consistent with tooth marks occur on several elements of the skeleton (e.g., partial ribs, fragment of nasal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It appears that the specimen was scavenged prior to burial, and some of the fractures may be due to trampling [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no preferred orientation or stream rounding to the bones (Fig 1C), which indicates that current transport was not a significant factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There also appears to be no surface degradation to the bones, which indicates that the remains of this animal were rapidly buried after they were scavenged [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collection__preparation__and_description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CMN 57081 was discovered on private land in September of 2005 by Dr. B. D. Shipp and J. C. Gilpatrick.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specimen was eroding out of the side of an incised creek valley.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, fragments of the femur and ribs were surface collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remainder of the specimen was excavated manually by Dr. Shipp, J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small, and team, and was removed over the following two years, using standard plaster and burlap jacketing techniques, with aluminum foil used as a separator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preparation of the specimen was accomplished by White River Preparium (Hill City, South Dakota) with air scribes and air abrasive machines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abrasives used include sodium bicarbonate for general preparation, and crushed marble for areas that were covered with ironstone concretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consolidants and adhesives used during preparation and restoration include polyvinyl butyral, and cyanoacrylate glues of varying viscosities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infill of cracks and reconstruction of individual parts were done with two-part epoxy putty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All consolidants, glues, and epoxy putties are removable if necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molds and casts were made of all cranial elements, and a complete skull was reconstructed (S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Missing elements were restored using cast parts from a small Triceratops horridus skull at the Black Hills Institute (Hill City, South Dakota).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Teeth were molded using President regular body polyvinylsiloxane (Coltène/Whaledent), and cast using Epotek 301 two-part epoxy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dental microwear was imaged using an FEI XL30 environmental scanning electron microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The humerus of CMN 57081 was CT scanned at Kadlec Regional Medical Center (Richland, Washington) using a GE Medical Systems LightSpeed 16 scanner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
No permits were required for the described study, which complied with all relevant regulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotype specimen is publicly accessible in the permanent repository of the CMN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Skeletochonology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to assess the ontogenetic age of CMN 57081, thin sections of the left fibula and a rib fragment were made using standard palaeohistological techniques [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thin sections were made and imaged at the ROM Palaeohistology Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior to sectioning, the elements were moulded and casted, and casts accessioned into the collections at the ROM and the CMN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elements were first embedded in Castolite resin, before being cut on a Buehler IsoMet 1000 Precision Cutter low-speed saw and mounted to a 2 mm plexiglass slide with either PSI 122/124 resin (fibula) or Scotch-Weld SF-100 cyanoacrylate (rib).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stubs were then cut down on the IsoMet saw, and subsequently ground down to the appropriate thickness using the grinding cup on a Hillquist Thin Section Machine, and finished by hand on a glass plate with 1000 silicon carbide grit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slides were then imaged using a Nikon DS-Fi1 camera mounted to a Nikon AZ-100 microscope under plain-polarized and cross-polarized light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were processed and assembled using Nikon NIS-Elements (Basic Research) v. 3.13 imaging software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both sections are on file at the CMN, but only the fibula section is described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the evolutionary relationships of CMN 57081 within Chasmosaurinae, we performed cladistic analyses using maximum parsimony inference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed the two character matrices of Brown and Henderson [34], which are modified from previous matrices by Sampson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [35] and Mallon et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two matrices assume different epiparietal homologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first homology scheme assumes the traditional hypothesis whereby a single median epiparietal is deemed P0 and all other epiparietals are given increasingly higher enumerations laterally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second scheme assumes that the traditional P0 epiparietal is homologous to the medialmost, paired epiparietals on the dorsal surface of the frill (seen in Anchiceratops, Pentaceratops, and Utahceratops), which are positionally homologous to the single P0 epiparietal of Regaliceratops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each matrix included 172 characters and 29 taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMN 57081 was coded for 116 characters (67% of the total).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further modified the matrices as follows: (1) character 24 (presence/absence of forked distal end of posteroventral process of premaxilla) was recoded as present for Vagaceratops; (2) character 49 (curvature of postorbital horncore in anterior view) was recoded as laterally curved for Kosmoceratops (previously miscoded as straight); (3) character 69 (length of squamosal relative to parietal) was recoded as squamosal slightly shorter than parietal, posterolateral-most margin of frill formed by the parietal for Vagaceratops; (4) character 70 (squamosal forms part of posterior margin of frill) was recoded as absent for Vagaceratops; (5) characters 7678 (relating to the shape of the posterior parietal bar) were recoded for Chasmosaurus belli, C. russelli, and Vagaceratops following Campbell et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [37]; (6) character 100 (episquamosal S2 shape) was recoded as low raised Dshaped process for Vagaceratops; (7) character 103 (marginal ossification crossing squamosalparietal contact) was recoded as absent for Vagaceratops, and as absent for Anchiceratops (the previously coded polymorphism for Anchiceratops arguably reflects an ontogenetic transformation, which is inadvisable; see Hennig [38]); (8) character 104 (shape of marginal ossification crossing squamosalparietal contact) was recoded as - (not applicable) for Vagaceratops; (9) character 105 (number of epiparietals per side) was recoded as five or more for Vagaceratops, and as polymorphic for Chasmosaurus belli; (10) codings for character 111 (presence/absence of epiparietal P1) were corrected in the traditional homology matrix (Pachyrhinosaurus was recoded as absent, chasmosaurines mistakenly coded as absent were instead coded as present) (11) characters 112114 (relating to the morphology of epiparietal 1) were recoded as - (not applicable) for Albertaceratops and Pachyrhinosaurus because epiparietal P1 is missing in these taxa; (12) postcranial characters 163165 and 172 were coded for Vagaceratops (after description of Holmes [39]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Character 33 (adult nasal ornamentation type) was specified as ordered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Character 93 (presence/absence of marginal undulations of frill) was excluded because it is non-independent of character 95 (presence/absence of frill epiossifications).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original matrix files are available as supporting information (S2 and S3 Files).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The parsimony analysis was conducted using PAUP* 4.0b10 for Windows [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the branch and bound search algorithm, with Leptoceratops defined as the outgroup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bootstrap values were estimated using 1,000 replicates and a random seed of 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bremer decay indices were calculated using TreeRot version 3 [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The fibula was transversely sectioned above the midshaft, approximately one-third of the total length from the proximal end (Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cortex varies in thickness around the small, sub-circular medullary cavity which itself is surrounded by a small amount of cancellous bone (Fig 13B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the cortex consists of densely packed and overlapping secondary osteons formed by extensive secondarily remodelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remodelling is particularly well developed in the lateral region of the bone, where it completely obliterates the primary bone tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is less remodelling posteriorly and medially, where the fibula is adjacent to the tibia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, some of the primary bone is visible, but it is nonetheless disrupted by secondary osteon development, making the identification of the primary tissue and growth marks challenging, especially in the deep cortex (Fig 13B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary cortical tissue consists largely of parallel-fibered matrix in the mid-cortex and outwards toward the periosteum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary vascularization is dominated by longitudinal canals, with relatively frequent but short, typically circumferential, anastomoses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vascularity appears to decrease moderately from the mid to outer cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven growth marks (Lines of Arrested Growth) can be traced through much of the medial side of the section, but zones or annuli in vascular patterns are difficult to identify in the region of primary bone that is visible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spacing of growth marks generally decreases towards the periosteum, with a series of three closely spaced LAGs present near the external surface of the bone (Fig 13C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outermost cortex, where not obscured by secondary remodelling, is comprised of poorly vascularized, highly organized bone and appears to form an external fundamental system (Fig 13A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signals the cessation of significant peripheral bone growth and suggests that CMN 57081 had reached somatic maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Determination of the number of growth marks within the EFS is not possible, although it seems likely that there are at least two in some regions, but these cannot be traced consistently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retrocalculation of the earliest growth marks is difficult given the shape of the bone and the extent of the medullary cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we estimate that CMN 57081 was likely at least 10 years old at death, and had reached its growth asymptote.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cladistic parsimony analysis using the traditional epiparietal homology scheme returned 28 most parsimonious trees (MPTs) of 320 steps each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis using the new epiparietal homology scheme returned 91 MPTs of 321 steps each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting strict consensus trees were not particularly well-resolved, especially in the latter case (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we pruned the wildcard taxa Bravoceratops and Eotriceratops, previously identified by Mallon et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [36], from the MPTs a posteriori and calculated reduced strict consensus trees, resulting in slightly improved resolution for the analysis using the new homology scheme (Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analysis using the traditional homology scheme (Fig 14, top) is better resolved than that of Brown and Henderson ([34]: fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chasmosaurinae exhibits a deep split, resulting in a Chasmosaurus clade (Chasmosaurus  Triceratops) and a Triceratops clade (Triceratops  Chasmosaurus), in accordance with recent findings [25, 34, 36, 69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bootstrap support for each of these clades is weak (49%) to moderate (74%), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Chasmosaurus and Triceratops clades are each supported by three unambiguous synapomorphies primarily relating to the snout and parietosquamosal frill (S1 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spiclypeus falls within the Chasmosaurus clade, as the sister taxon to the group Kosmoceratops + Vagaceratops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bootstrap support for the Spiclypeus (Kosmoceratops + Vagaceratops) clade is low (32%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nine synapomorphies that unite this clade primarily relate to the snout, postorbital horncores, and the parietosquamosal frill and its epiossifications (S1 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reduced strict consensus tree using the new homology scheme (Fig 14, bottom) is more poorly resolved than that assuming the traditional homology scheme (and that of Brown and Henderson [34]) in that the constituent taxa of the Chasmosaurus clade are reduced to a polytomy at the base of Chasmosaurinae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Triceratops clade is recovered with the same topology as that using the traditional homology scheme, and maintains good bootstrap support (74%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourteen unambiguous synapomorphies unite Anchiceratops with the remainder of the Triceratops clade, primarily relating to the snout and parietosquamosal frill (S1 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taxonomic_validity_of_Spiclypeus_shipporum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first recognized ceratopsid was Ceratops montanus (USNM 2411) from the upper JRF, known only from a pair of postorbital horncores (Fig 6G) and partial occiput [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotype locality was described as the northwestern slope near the summit, about 300 yards from the point of the first hogback that projects into the valley of Cow Creek from the west, just below where the old Cow Island and Fort Benton freight road descends into the valley of Cow Creek, about 10 miles above the confluence of that stream with the Missouri River [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This places the site ~53 km away from that of CMN 57081, and both sites are among the few located along the Missouri River to yield ceratopsid material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marsh [3] initially illustrated the horncores of Ceratops as projecting anterodorsally, but Hatcher et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [46] subsequently showed that they instead projected dorsolaterally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the horncores closely resemble those of CMN 57081, which are just 20 mm longer (Fig 6A6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the similarity between the two specimens, and their geographic and stratigraphic proximity, it is possible that they represent the same taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, this finding would be significant because C. montanus has long been considered a nomen dubium [1, 5, 7, 16], owing to its scant remains, and the assignment of new fossil material would help clarify one of the longest standing mysteries in horned dinosaur palaeontology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The issue hinges on whether the postorbital horncores of C. montanus are diagnostic to the species level, which is typically not the case among ceratopsids [5], and where the size and orientation of the horncores is known to vary with age in other chasmosaurines [70, 71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two other ceratopsid species, the centrosaurine Albertaceratops [5] and the chasmosaurine Kosmoceratops [35], have also been described as having elongate, dorsolaterally projecting postorbital horncores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those of the Kosmoceratops holotype are especially similar to those of Ceratops in size and shape (Table 1; Fig 6G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preservation of a growth series of Albertaceratops reveals that the postorbital horncores grew longer with age, originating as the short pyramidal elements (e.g., WDCB-MC-001) typically seen in the adults of more derived centrosaurines, and eventually reaching lengths of at least 342 mm (e.g., TMP 2002.003.0036; Fig 6I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The horncores of the Ceratops holotype fall somewhere between these two extremes, and might conceivably represent a growth stage of Albertaceratops, which occurs slightly lower in section within the same formation (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we concur with previous studies [1, 5, 7, 16] that the postorbital horncores of Ceratops are non-diagnostic, and that the monospecific genus is a nomen dubium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possibleeven likely, given their close stratigraphic and geological associationthat Ceratops and CMN 57081 are the same species, but without conclusive evidence for such, it is preferable to erect a new species for CMN 57081.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Taxonomic_validity_of_Pentaceratops_aquilonius  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Longrich [72] established the new chasmosaurine species Pentaceratops aquilonius based on a partial parietosquamosal frill (CMN 9813), collected in 1937 by C. M. Sternberg from the Lethbridge Coal Zone near Manyberries, Alberta, and initially attributed to Anchiceratops [73, 74].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the holotype frill closely resembles the upper Campanian/lower Maastrichtian Anchiceratops (particularly the holotype of A. longirostris; see Mallon et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [57]) in the size and shape of its preserved epiossifications, Longrich noted that the specimen is unlikely to pertain to this genus because of its much earlier occurrence (~4 Myr), and because the parietal fenestrae more closely approach the parietal-squamosal suture as in Pentaceratops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longrich assigned an additional parietal fragment (CMN 9814, the paratype) to P. aquilonius, also collected in 1937 nearly 16 km away from the holotype locality, at approximately the same stratigraphic horizon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Longrichs interpretation, the fragment bears a dorsally directed P1 epiparietal, and a posteriorly directed P2 epiparietal lying entirely within the plane of the frill (Fig 15, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming the paratype to be attributable to same species as the holotype, Longrich [72] diagnosed P. aquilonius as follows: weak median emargination of parietal, with lateral rami meeting at an angle of ~90 degrees, and U-shaped emargination not strongly extended anteriorly; P1 projects dorsally, rather than anteriorly; lateral epiossifications less_than100 mm in length; posterior bar of parietal anteroposteriorly broad relative to P. sternbergii or Utahceratops gettyi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The discovery of Spiclypeus shipporum casts doubt on the validity of P. aquilonius.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P. aquilonius paratype quite closely matches S. shipporum in the morphology of the posterior parietal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What Longrich [72] labelled as epiparietals P1 and P2 closely resemble epiparietal P3 and the EPS of S. shipporum (Fig 15, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, what we interpret as the incomplete P3 epiparietal is slightly twisted and medially thickened where it presumably once would have merged with the coossified P2 epiparietal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this interpretation of the paratype, the free posterior parietal border identified by Longrich (which he presumed was once capped by the P3 epiparietal) instead becomes the squamosal contact, an interpretation that is consistent with the lack of scalloping or scarring expected of an epiossification attachment site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given this reinterpretation of the P. aquilonius paratype, the relationship of this specimen to the holotype is obscured because the morphology of epiparietal P3 (Longrichs P2) no longer corresponds between both specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the P3 epiparietal of the paratype is dorsally directed, it is posteriorly directed in the holotype ([72]: fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inconsistency is conceivably attributable to species-level differences, in which case, the holotype of P. aquilonius is distinct and the species remains valid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the small size of the specimen (corresponding to a frill just ~100 cm long; see Longrich [72]) bespeaks a relatively immature individual, and it is plausible that the development of the frill epiossifications would have changed with age to become more like that of the paratype, which comes from a larger individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such changes in frill ornamentation, including the growth, reorientation, and fusion of the epiossifications, are common among ceratopsids [71, 75].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These doubts are difficult to assuage, given the poor quality of the material referred to P. aquilonius, and for this reason we consider the species a nomen dubium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pathologies_of_CMN_57081  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is evident from the various pathologies that riddle the frill and humerus of CMN 57081 that the animal was in poor health before it died.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tanke and Farke [47] made the case that squamosal fenestrae in chasmosaurines usually result from bone resorption under normal conditions; however, the association of squamosal fenestrae in CMN 57081 with abscess cavities and drainage tracts suggests that the fenestrae may be pathological in origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The etiology of the pathology is unknown, but the largest squamosal fenestra conceivably resulted from intraspecific combat, as its general shape and location on the animal is consistent with a blow from the laterally pointing postorbital horncores of a conspecific [76, 77].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wound would later have become infected, leading to remodelling of the bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The distal half of the humerus exhibits rough bony remodeling and the presence of an abscess cavity between the condyles, consistent with a chronic infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One can only speculate as to the infectious organism responsible; however, chronic tuberculous infections have a similar appearance in modern humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial infections would typically rapidly weaken the bone, leading to bone destruction and pathologic fractures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not seen in CMN 57081, suggesting that the animal was walking around for a prolonged period of time, giving the bone time to respond to the infection via hypertrophic remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would suggest infection by a more indolent organism such as tuberculosis or perhaps a fungus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these impairments, skeletochronology indicates that the animal lived at least 710 years, attesting to its robust constitution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dinosaur_assemblage_of_Judith_River_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite its long collecting history (e.g., [14, 17, 18, 7880]), the dinosaur assemblage of the JRF remains relatively poorly understood, presently known from just nine reasonably diagnostic species, and several other microfossil taxa (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, the time-equivalent Belly River Group of Alberta has yielded ~55 distinct species [9], and the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah has yielded ~16 [81].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However insufficiently sampled the dinosaur assemblage of the JRF, the discovery of Spiclypeus highlights both the taxonomically unique and temporally dynamic nature of the assemblage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlation and dating of the strata of the JRF throughout Montana [10, 13, 23] provide a useful framework for investigating faunal turnover within the formation (Fig 2), although dating accuracy remains problematic (see [10] and [21] for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oldest of the JRF strata are best exposed near Rudyard (Kennedy Coulee) in north central Montana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These strata date to between 79.5 ± 0.2 Ma and 79.1 ± 0.2 Ma, based on 40Ar/39Ar analysis of biotite and sanidine crystals from two local bentonites ([23]; recalibrated in [10]), and fossil occurrences are generally attributable to the lower McClelland Ferry Member (sensu Rogers et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10]), correlative to the uppermost Foremost Formation (Taber Coal Zone and Herronton Sandstone) and lowermost Oldman Formation in Alberta [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ceratopsids Medusaceratops [7] and Albertaceratops [5], the hadrosaurid Probrachylophosaurus [21], and the pachycephalosaurid Colepiocephale [22] occur within the upper muddy unit of the Kennedy Coulee area, which corresponds to Unit 1 of the Oldman Formation (~79.1 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hadrosaurid Brachylophosaurus goodwini [82] also originates from these strata, but is most recently considered to be an indeterminate brachylophosaurin [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ceratopsid Judiceratops [6] likewise occurs in Kennedy Coulee, but its stratigraphic position is not precisely known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotypes of Wendiceratops and Albertaceratops were collected in lithostratigraphically and chronostratigraphically equivalent sediments of the lowermost Oldman Formation just across the international border in Alberta [83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exposures of the JRF near Malta, Montana, ~200 km ESE of Kennedy Coulee, have yielded abundant remains attributable to Brachylophosaurus canadensis [21, 84, 85].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposures in this area are more distal along the depositional wedge and closer to the Western Interior Seaway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tan coloured, quartz-rich sandstones exposed here are attributable to the middle McClelland Ferry Member, equivalent to the Comrey Sandstone Zone (Unit 2) of the middle Oldman Formation in Alberta, and date to at least ~77.76 Ma [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately 250 km SW of Malta, the JRF is well exposed near the Musselshell River of Wheatland and Golden Valley counties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fossil locales here typically occur in sandy fluvial deposits within ~70 m of the Parkman Sandstone Member [20], and likely also pertain to the lower McClelland Ferry Member (R. Rogers, pers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  comm., 2016).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dinosaurs reported from these deposits are known primarily from microfossil bonebeds, and include the dromaeosaurids Dromaeosaurus albertensis and Saurornitholestes langstoni, the troodontid Troodon formosus, Richardoestesia gilmorei and another indeterminate theropod [19], and tyrannosaurids, hadrosaurids, pachycephalosaurids, nodosaurids, and ceratopsids [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotype of the ceratopsid Avaceratops lammersi, which is known from a reasonably complete skeleton, originates from the Careless Creek Quarry, which occurs locally [4, 20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The age of the beds in this region is poorly constrained, but the strata likely date to no younger than ~76.24 Ma, which is the age of the upper boundary of the McClelland Ferry Member in the JRF type area [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The type area for the JRF occurs within the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument [12], where the formation is exposed in its entirety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also the region where the first fossil vertebrates were collected from the JRF in the latter half of the 19th century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The earliest expeditions occurred near the confluence of the Judith and Missouri rivers, where the McClelland Ferry and lowermost Coal Ridge members are well exposed ([10]; R. Rogers, pers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  comm., 2016).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, F. V. Hayden found remains of the tyrannosaurid Deinodon horridus, the troodontid Troodon formosus, the nodosaurid Palaeoscincus costatus, and the hadrosaurid Trachodon mirabilis [17, 78].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent work in the area by E. D. Cope and assistant C. H. Sternberg uncovered new species, including the tyrannosaurids Aublysodon lateralis, Laelaps incrassatus, L. falculus, and L. hazenanius, the dromaeosaurids L. laevifrons and Zapsalis abradens, the troodontids L. explanatus, L. cristatus, and Paronychodon lacustris, the ceratopsids Dysganus encaustus, Dy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  haydenianus, Dy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bicarinatus, and Dy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  peiganus, and the hadrosaurids Diclonius pentagonus, Di.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  perangulatus, and Di.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  calamarius [14, 18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these species are now considered nomina dubia [1, 8688].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further downstream on the Missouri River, near the area of Cow Island, Cope and Sternberg later found partial cranial remains of the indeterminate centrosaurines Monoclonius crassus, M. sphenocerus, M. recurvicornis, and M. fissus [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uppermost McClelland Ferry and lower Coal Ridge members are exposed here, and it seems likely that these problematic taxa are restricted to the latter member, given its more extensive exposure ([10]; R. Rogers, pers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  comm., 2016).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microfossil bonebeds are especially common elsewhere in the lower third of the Coal Ridge Member, and contain evidence of tyrannosaurids, troodontids, ankylosaurs, ceratopsids, and hadrosaurids [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ceratopsids Spiclypeus and Mercuriceratops [8] are likewise known from this interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microfossil material described by Sahni [12] is from the upper third of the Coal Ridge Member, and includes tyrannosaurids, troodontids, ankylosaurids, pachycephalosaurids, ceratopsids, hypsilophodontids, and hadrosaurids [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These date to no later than ~75.21 Ma, which is the age of the upper boundary of the Coal Ridge Member [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposures of the Coal Ridge Member near Havre contain microsite bonebeds and hadrosaurid eggs and embryos [89].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To date, five of the nine well-described species from the JRF are known exclusively from the formation, with the remainder known also from time-equivalent strata in Alberta, Canada [80, 90].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Material from Alberta previously assigned to Pentaceratops aquilonius may strengthen this biogeographic link, should it prove to be closely allied to Spiclypeus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of some dubious tooth taxa, there are, as yet, no species from Montana that also occur in time-equivalent strata further south (e.g., Kaiparowits Formation, Utah; Fruitland Formation, New Mexico; Aguja Formation, Texas), according with previous suggestions that there existed a dispersal barrier somewhere between Montana and Utah [35, 90, 91].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the close affinity between Spiclypeus from Montana and Kosmoceratops from Utah suggests that some ephemeral geographic connection was present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longrich [72] argued that Kosmoceratops ranged as far north as Alberta, but this was recently disproved by Campbell et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evolution_of_Chasmosaurinae  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study is part of a growing body of work [25, 34, 36, 69] finding cladistic support for a deep split within Chasmosaurinae, yielding Chasmosaurus and Triceratops as the terminal end-members of their respective subclades (although the present analysis using the new homology scheme is ambiguous in this respect).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brown and Henderson [34] correctly pointed out that such a topology implies a long ghost lineage for the Triceratops clade, extending from the late Maastrichtian into the late Campanian, a duration of ~6 Myr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we note that this interpretation is contingent on the classification of the late Campanian to early Maastrichtian Titanoceratops, Anchiceratops, and Arrhinoceratops as members of the Triceratops clade, which is debated [25, 36, 69, 70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Was this not the case, the Triceratops clade would become synonymous with Triceratopsini (sensu Longrich [92]), and entirely relegated to the mid- to late Maastrichtian, greatly reducing the length of the implied ghost lineage and underscoring the role that adaptive radiation may have played in the evolution of the clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, we note that there is presently considerable debate concerning the relationships within Chasmosaurinae, with some [35, 72] arguing for a generally pectinate topology in which Chasmosaurus is basal and Triceratops is most derived.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical support for this or any other topology is currently weak, likely reflecting issues of missing data and character conflict.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides determined fieldwork and the pursuit of more complete specimens, we would likewise encourage the search for new and phylogenetically informative characters, particularly in the braincase (e.g., [25]) and postcranium (e.g., [39, 44]), which are traditionally overlooked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Explicit and illustrated character state definitions would also help to ensure compatibility between studies, which is presently concerning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study recovers Kosmoceratops and Vagaceratops as sister taxa, united by an anteroposteriorly abbreviated frill, small and caudally placed parietal fenestrae, and the presence of 10 anteriorly curled epiossifications on the posterior margin of the frill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relationship is in keeping with most recent cladistic findings [25, 3436, 69], although some [37, 59, 72] maintain that Vagaceratops is more closely allied to Chasmosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, the anteriorly curled epiossifications of Kosmoceratops and Vagaceratops are highly distinctive among chasmosaurines, and no explanation has yet been provided as to how such an elaborate condition was achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recovery of Spiclypeus as the sister taxon to Kosmoceratops + Vagaceratops suggests that the anterior curling of the posterior frill epiossifications occurred in a step-wise fashion, at least on the line leading to Kosmoceratops, with the medialmost epiparietals curling anteriorly first, followed by those epiossifications further laterally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of this process evidently preceded the anteroposterior abbreviation of the frill and constriction of the parietal fenestrae, as these characters occur in their primitive state in Spiclypeus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the transitional nature of Spiclypeus in these respects, the taxon was approximately equivalent in time to Kosmoceratops ([93]: fig 14]), and so could not have been ancestral to it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
