Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluation of a Gender Equity and Family Planning Intervention for Married Men and Couples in Rural India  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Background  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite ongoing recommendations to increase male engagement and gender-equity (GE) counseling in family planning (FP) services, few such programs have been implemented and rigorously evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study evaluates the impact of CHARM, a three-session GE+FP counseling intervention delivered by male health care providers to married men, alone (sessions 1&2) and with their wives (session 3) in India.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods_and_Findings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with young married couples (N = 1081 couples) recruited from 50 geographic clusters (25 clusters randomized to CHARM and a control condition, respectively) in rural Maharashtra, India.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Couples were surveyed on demographics, contraceptive behaviors, and intimate partner violence (IPV) attitudes and behaviors at baseline and 9 &18-month follow-ups, with pregnancy testing at baseline and 18-month follow-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outcome effects on contraceptive use and incident pregnancy, and secondarily, on contraceptive communication and mens IPV attitudes and behaviors, were assessed using logistic generalized linear mixed models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most men recruited from CHARM communities (91.3%) received at least one CHARM intervention session; 52.5% received the couples session with their wife.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings document that women from the CHARM condition, relative to controls, were more likely to report contraceptive communication at 9-month follow-up (AOR = 1.77, p = 0.04) and modern contraceptive use at 9 and 18-month follow-ups (AORs = 1.571.58, p = 0.05), and they were less likely to report sexual IPV at 18-month follow-up (AOR = 0.48, p = 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Men in the CHARM condition were less likely than those in the control clusters to report attitudes accepting of sexual IPV at 9-month (AOR = 0.64, p = 0.03) and 18-month (AOR = 0.51, p = 0.004) follow-up, and attitudes accepting of physical IPV at 18-month follow-up (AOR = 0.64, p = 0.02).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant effect on pregnancy was seen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Findings demonstrate that men can be engaged in FP programming in rural India, and that such an approach inclusive of GE counseling can improve contraceptive practices and reduce sexual IPV in married couples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Globally, an estimated 153 million women contend with unmet need for family planning (FP); more than one in five of these women reside in India [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inadequate FP progress in India has been attributed to over-reliance on female sterilization as the preferred, and often only, means of modern contraception used, and low female control over contraception, particularly among young and rural married women [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Awareness of modern spacing contraceptives, i.e., contraceptives designed to impede fertility on a reversible basis, is high in India, even among young, less educated and rural women, and availability of these contraceptives at low and no cost through Indias public health care system is also well understood [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, of the 49% of married and sexually active unmarried women of childbearing age who use modern contraceptives in India, fewer than one in four (22.9%, or 11.1% of all of these women) use spacing contraceptives, such as oral contraceptive pills (6.4%, or 3.1% of all of these women), condoms (10.7%, or 5.2% of all of these women), and intrauterine contraceptive devices (3.5%, or 1.7% of all of these women) [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research from India indicates that family planning programs often attempt to reach young wives only after they reach their family size goal, despite indications that demand for contraceptive use to delay first pregnancy is high [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low support for and use of spacing contraceptives to delay first pregnancy and improve birth spacing contribute to ongoing high rates of infant mortality [4] and one in five unintended pregnancies in India [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increasing use of modern spacing contraceptives in the country requires improved demand for such contraception from both men and women, given that men often control contraceptive decision-making [513].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male reproductive control of female partners, particularly in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV), can impede contraceptive use and increase risk for contraceptive failure, in India and globally [1416].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given mens role in controlling contraception and, relatedly, the need to improve gender equity in this context (as demonstrated by disproportionate burden of IPV in the country [2, 17]), engagement of men in FP interventions requires greater prioritization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, no model of FP promotion with male engagement has been rigorously evaluated for India; the single rigorously evaluated FP intervention that has engaged men was conducted in Malawi and did not assess for effects on mens IPV perpetration [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current study evaluates CHARM [Counseling Husbands to Achieve Reproductive health and Marital equity], a three-session gender equity and family planning (GE+FP) counseling intervention delivered by male health care providers to married men, both alone and with their wives, to improve contraceptive use and reduce incident pregnancy and, secondarily, improve contraceptive communication and reduce IPV perpetration and acceptability in rural India.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the impact of the CHARM intervention on marital contraceptive use and incident pregnancy, and secondarily on contraceptive communication and mens IPV attitudes and perpetration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Married couples (N = 1081) were recruited from rural areas of Thane district, Maharashtra, India from March to December 2012, and followed over a period of 18 months for this evaluation trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rural Thane district was selected to be the study setting due to its prevalence of high and early fertility, low contraceptive use, high unmet need for family planning and limited access to government health services; the area is also characterized by high representation of tribal communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This selection was made by our partnering medical college and government agencies based on non-public data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Randomization_and_Masking  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participating couples were recruited from 62 geographic clusters of approximately equal size mapped for the purpose of randomization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clusters were created based on geographic boundaries, population density (approximately 300 households per cluster), and proximity to public and private health services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifty of the 62 clusters were selected based on ease of reach, then randomized to intervention or control conditions using computer-generated random numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clusters were geographically distinct areas with natural borders and sufficient distance from other study clusters to reduce risk for contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clusters were randomized into intervention and control conditions on 20th Feb 2012, in the month prior to initiation of enrollment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Households within each cluster were screened sequentially for eligibility; recruitment of eligible households was capped at n = 25 per cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither participants nor research staff were masked to the treatment condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants of this two-armed design (n = 467 intervention condition couples, n = 614 control condition couples) were surveyed at baseline and 9 and 18-month follow-up (with a window of no more than one month around the due date); women were tested for pregnancy at baseline and at 18-month follow-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eligible couples included husbands aged 1830 years and their wives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the legal age of marriage is 21 for males and 18 for females in India, marriage of minors is not uncommon [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were required to be fluent in Marathi (native language of Maharashtra) and residing together for the past three months with no intent to relocate in the next 2 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Couples reporting infertility, surgical sterilization, or exhibiting serious cognitive or health impairment were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both members of the couple had to provide consent and indicate eligibility and willingness to participate in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 1881 participants approached to assess eligibility, 1162 were identified as eligible, and 1081 of these agreed to participate in the study (81 declined, 93% participation rate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The very high participation rate is attributable to the fact that participants would only allow us to assess for eligibility if they were open to participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sample_Size_Determination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sample size and power considerations were constructed based on our primary outcomes of interest: any spacing contraceptive use and communication, and assuming a baseline sample size of 1000 couples, equally distributed across the 50 clusters (25 intervention clusters and 25 control clusters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also assumed 80% retention by 18-month follow-up and thus, based our calculations on 800 men.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All calculations were based on 2-sided logistic regressions with a significance level of 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we utilized longitudinal regression methods in our analyses, power calculations were more conservatively based on single time-point methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computations were also adjusted for the design effect in order to account for the correlation of subjects within the same village.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming 20 men enrolled in each village, and a within village correlation (Kappa) of 0.10, the design effect [1 + within village correlation*(# of men per village-1)] was estimated to be equal to 2.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on power calculations for primary outcomes can be found in Yore et al., 2016 [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also provide an example calculation specific to one of our primary outcomes, use of modern spacing contraceptives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Power calculations for this binary outcome were based on logistic regression of the outcome on a binary independent variable (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Group 1 = Intervention Group, Group 2 = Control Group) with 800 subjects equally distributed between the two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the proportion of women reporting use of contraceptives in Group 2 is 8%, 10%, or 12%, then we would have over 80% power to detect a difference between Group 1 and Group 2, when the corresponding proportion in Group 1 is 20% (ORGroup1/Group2 = 2.8), 22% (ORGroup1/Group2 = 2.59), and 25%(ORGroup1/Group2 = 2.45), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the NFHS-3 data [2], we expected that the proportion of couples using any marital spacing contraception in the control group (Group 2) would be 10% at 18 months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the above assumptions, the proposed study had 80% power to detect an absolute difference as small as 12% between the two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_Retention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of the 1081 couples participating in baseline assessment, 83.1% (n = 898) and 82.4% (891 couples) completed 9 and 18 month follow-ups, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [See Fig 1] Reasons for loss to follow-up were predominantly inability to find participants due to relocation, or refusal due to time constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No one withdrew from the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All available data were included in analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trained male-female research teams approached identified households for recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age-eligible couples indicating interest and willingness to participate provided written informed consent and were screened privately for eligibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once eligibility was ascertained, couples privately and separately participated in the baseline survey, and women provided urine for pregnancy testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surveys were administered in an interview format with research staff asking participants all questions and noting their responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With recognition of the high rates of spousal violence in India [2], World Health Organization guidelines for research on domestic violence were followed to help ensure that women participating in our study, which did include domestic violence assessments, were not at increased risk for violence due to their participation [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, in addition to separately and privately surveying husbands and wives, we only surveyed women on experiences of spousal violence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also did not inform husbands of the pregnancy test or test results obtained through this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants, subsequent to baseline assessment, were provided with basic information regarding family planning and local public health system family planning services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All female participants were also provided with information on how to contact police and the nearest domestic violence services, which unfortunately were not local (two hours away by car); transport was to be offered to any participants indicating interest in linkage to those services, but no interest was indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following the baseline assessment protocol, husbands from intervention clusters were linked to male village health care providers trained to implement the CHARM intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Follow-up surveys were conducted again at 9 and 18-month follow-ups; urine tests for pregnancy were conducted only at 18-month follow-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although screener and baseline survey data were collected on paper, follow-up survey data were collected on mobile tablets presenting English and Marathi simultaneously, to ensure clarity of the questions for our bilingual research staff, using the MSHARE (Mobile Survey for Health Assessment, Research and Evaluation) System.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MSHARE system reduced human error in data collection and entry and allowed for real time data uploads and simultaneous data sharing on the internet, as well as more rapid management of data for analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surveys and pregnancy testing required approximately one hour from participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No monetary incentive was provided for study or program participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further details on procedures, see the study protocol paper [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of University of California at San Diego, Population Council and Indias National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov on May 2, 2012 (Clinical Trials number: NCT01593943), though study enrollment started on March 26, 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The delay in registration is due to our ignorance of this requirement for journal submissions from the study; we registered the trial soon after learning of the requirement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 172 couples, 16% of our final sample of N = 1081 couples, had been recruited prior to trial registration, and no analysis of data by treatment group was conducted at that point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, no changes to the study design or approach occurred during the period of study initiation and registration, such that the delayed trial registration was in no way related to or affected by the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirm that all related trials to this intervention were registered; there are no ongoing trials related to this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CHARM_Intervention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The intervention involved three gender, culture and contextually-tailored family planning and gender equity (FP+GE) counseling sessions delivered by trained male village health care providers to married men (sessions 1 and 2) and couples (session 3) in a clinical setting, or if required, near or in the participants home.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Table 1 for details on curriculum content by session.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A desk-sized CHARM flipchart was used by village health providers to provide men and couples with pictorial information on family planning options, barriers to family planning use including gender equity-related issues (e.g., son preference), the importance of healthy and shared family planning decision-making, and how to engage in respectful marital communication and interactions (inclusive of no spousal violence in the mens sessions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sessions were delivered over a three month period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [See Table 1 for details.]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each contact, village health providers also offered free condoms and oral contraceptive pills; the latter required women to visit the provider.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formative research for the study indicated that retention of men across multiple sessions and couple participation in sessions might prove difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, session 1 was designed to include all required content, in case participants were then lost to program, and sessions 2 and 3 could be optional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sessions 2 and 3 were not presented to the participants as optional in practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Control_Condition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Women in the control condition were referred to government health system FP services, which provide no-cost contraception and home-based visits for family planning counseling and services delivered by front line public health workers (e.g., accredited social health activists- i.e., community outreach workers; the auxiliary nurse midwife).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control condition did not include use of village health providers, or any providers, to engage men in FP services, as that is not the standard of care in India.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sociodemographics (e.g., age, education- any and number of years) were assessed for both husbands and wives via single item measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For those items shared by the couple (e.g., number of living sons and daughters), womens data were used unless otherwise indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Womens reports of contraceptive behaviors have been viewed as a reliable indicator for the couple within the context of India [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pregnancy intent was assessed by asking women if they wished to have another child: now/soon, never, or within a specified number of months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those reporting wanting another child now/soon or within 12 months were defined as having pregnancy intent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Outcome_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bivariate analyses in the form of t-tests and chi-squares were conducted to assess differences on demographics and outcomes at baseline: 1) by treatment group, 2) for those lost to study follow-up, and 3) for CHARM participants who participated in no sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any characteristics identified as significantly different between groups were considered as potential covariates in respective adjusted models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The two primary outcomes of interest, marital contraceptive use and incident pregnancy, as well as the secondary outcomes of marital contraceptive communication and IPV perpetration behavior and attitudes, were assessed via logistic regression generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), using cluster as a random effect and with time, treatment group (CHARM vs control), and the time by treatment interaction as fixed effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covariates were included in the final adjusted models if they either were 1) selected a priori for inclusion due to being a known confounder or covariate, or 2) if significant baseline differences existed between assigned treatment groups and the variable maintained significance in the adjusted regression model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models on contraceptive use and communication, pregnancy, and IPV outcomes adjusted for womens age and education (any or none), caste or tribe, number of living sons, and number of living daughters, as well as pregnancy intent (contraceptive use and communication models only).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adjusted models for IPV attitude outcomes controlled for mens age and education, and caste or tribe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pless_than0.15 assessed significant time by treatment interactions [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simple main effects were reported in order to describe the size of differences over time and between groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other analyses were evaluated for significance at pless_than0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All analyses included both intent to treat and dose analyses approaches and were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute, Version 9.4, Cary, NC, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GLIMMIX procedure in SAS was used to build the above described logistic generalized linear mixed models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure allows for both G-side and R-side covariance structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these models, "cluster" (used at the level of randomization) was considered a random effect with a G-side covariance structure, while the variance resulting from repeated measures on each study participant over time was considered as a random effect with an R-side covariance structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, a standard variance component (i.e., simple diagonal) was used for the underlying structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional exploratory chi-square analyses were conducted to assess differences between treatment groups at 9 and 18 month follow-ups on the contraceptive communication outcome, for the total sample and for the subsamples who did and did not report contraceptive communication at baseline, to assess whether observed effects on this outcome were attributable to new or continuing conversations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploratory chi-square analyses were also conducted to assess differences between treatment groups and by dose for the outcomes of pregnancy and unintended pregnancy across both follow-up time points, to allow for more opportunity for observation of pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses were conducted to help clarify outcome analyses related to incident pregnancy and contraceptive communication, with findings included in supplemental tables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants (N = 1081 couples) were majority (68.0%) tribal, and 17.5% of women and 8.5% of men had no formal education.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most (76.9%) had children; 42.3% reported marital contraceptive communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Table 2) Excluding the 22.1% pregnant at baseline, 28.4% were using modern contraceptives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant differences were observed between intervention and control cluster participants at baseline for womens education (intervention: 87.6%, control: 78.6%), and income (intervention: 6054 rupees, control: 4978 rupees) (pless_than0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These factors were included in the adjusted outcome analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences were seen between those who were retained and those who were lost to follow-up in the study, nor between CHARM participants that did and did not attend any counseling sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153190.t002  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A significant time by treatment effect on contraceptive use was seen in intent to treat analyses (p = 0.02), and marginally significant differences by treatment group were seen for contraceptive use at 9 and 18 month follow-ups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Table 3) Further examination of the time by treatment effect revealed that contraceptive use in the intervention group increased significantly from baseline at both 9 month (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.53, 2.95) and 18 month (AOR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.88, 3.61) follow ups, while the control group increased at 18 month follow up (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.12, 2.04), but less than that seen in the intervention group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dose analyses further revealed that contraceptive use doubled by 18 month follow-up among those participating in male only sessions (AOR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.18, 3.27) and in male and couple sessions (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.26, 3.17), relative to those receiving no intervention sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Table 4) As seen in S1 Table, improvements in contraceptive use for intervention relative to control participants are largely attributable to condom use rather than other forms of contraceptives such as pill or female sterilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153190.t004  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A significant time by treatment effect on marital contraceptive communication was also demonstrated (p = 0.002).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Table 3) Significant differences between treatment groups are seen for marital contraceptive communication at 9 month follow-up (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.20, 2.59) but not 18 month follow-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dose analyses further document that these observed effects are specific to participants receiving couple sessions (AOR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.58, 3.49) relative to no sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among participants who had not discussed contraception with their spouse at baseline, intervention participants were more likely to initiate a first discussion at 9 month follow-up than controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See S2 Table) Among participants who had discussed contraception with their spouse, intervention participants were more likely than control participants to continue those discussions at both 9 and 18 month follow-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
No significant time by treatment effects were seen for pregnancy based on self-report or self-report combined with urine test results (p greater than 0.15) within intent to treat analyses or by dose (see Tables 2 and 3) Exploratory analyses were conducted to assess if there were differences by treatment group and by dose for the outcomes of pregnancy or unintended pregnancy at either follow-up time point via chi-square analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No effect was observed for pregnancy, but the intervention group was significantly more likely (p = 0.02) to report having an unintended pregnancy over the follow-up period (15.2% vs. 10.1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See S3 Table) No significant difference in unintended pregnancy between groups was observed in dose analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
No significant time by treatment effect was seen for physical IPV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Table 5) However, significant time by treatment effects were observed for attitudes toward acceptability of physical IPV outcome (p = 0.01), with intervention men significantly less likely than controls to report attitudes of acceptability toward physical IPV at 18 month follow-up (AOR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.44, 0.94).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dose analyses further demonstrate that men receiving male and couple sessions relative to no sessions were significantly less likely to be accepting of physical IPV at 18 month follow-up (AOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.37, 0.82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Table 6)  #@NEW_LINE#@#

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153190.t006  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
No significant time by treatment effects were seen for sexual IPV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Table 5) However, women in the intervention group were significantly less likely than controls to report sexual IPV at 18 month follow-up (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.27, 0.86).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant time by treatment interaction effects were seen for attitudes accepting of sexual IPV (pless_than0.001), with intervention men significantly less likely than controls to report acceptance of sexual IPV at 9 month (AOR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.43, 0.95) and 18 month follow-ups (AOR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.32, 0.80).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small cell sizes resulted in unstable estimates for sexual IPV and sexual IPV attitudes in dose analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Table 6)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Men who received CHARM and participated in the response to program survey (n = 347) largely ( greater than 93%) reported comprehensive FP content coverage and positive response to program, but only half of participants reported receipt of contraceptives, almost exclusively in the form of condoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Table 7) Most participants (81.6%) found the mens sessions very useful, but only 58.5% found the couple session useful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority very much enjoyed the program (85.3%) and very much felt it should be continued (78.1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Study findings document the effectiveness of CHARM in engaging husbands and improving marital contraceptive communication and use among young couples in rural Maharashtra, India.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings build on prior research demonstrating that men can be effectively engaged to promote family planning in their marital relationships [2731].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dose analyses further reveal that couple sessions were required to improve contraceptive communication, highlighting the importance of couple sessions, despite the greater difficulty in achieving couple versus male only session participation (52% vs 91%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, even male-only sessions show promise in improving marital contraceptive use in this rural population in India.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results of this study also demonstrate effects of CHARM on reduction in mens perpetration of sexual IPV and attitudes toward acceptability of IPV, likely due to inclusion of GE counseling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior research from Africa indicates that GE counseling with men, alone or in the context of HIV prevention, reduces IPV perpetration [3235]; the current study extends these findings to FP programs and South Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, increases in physical and sexual IPV were reported for the control condition, and in physical IPV for the CHARM condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unclear whether this is due to increases in violence or greater disclosure over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Field reports suggest increased disclosure occurred, as rapport was built with research staff collecting data over the course of the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further research is needed to confirm this observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CHARM intervention did not demonstrate impact on pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative lack of impact on incident pregnancy may be due to CHARM effects on contraception largely being in the form of condom use, which is not a highly effective form of contraception, given its 21% failure rate [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploratory analyses on unintended pregnancy reinforce these findings, with unintended pregnancy being more likely among intervention relative to control participants over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future replication of CHARM would benefit from prioritization of more effective contraceptive methods, such as intrauterine devices, and better engagement of wives to facilitate their use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While study results are promising, they must be considered in light of certain limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outcomes were largely reliant on self-report, and are vulnerable to recall and social desirability biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our primary outcome of contraceptive use does not include consideration of consistency in use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low reporting on some outcomes, such as items related to acceptability of sexual violence, may affect findings, particularly for dose analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, fidelity to intervention also relied on self-report.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ideally, audiotapes or direct observations would have been used, but this was not preferred by participants due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were also difference between groups on womens education and income at baseline, despite randomization, but there were no differences in any of the outcomes assessed in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study was conducted in a single Indian district in one state, limiting generalizability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unintended pregnancy variable relies on intention as reported 9 months prior to the pregnancy, and intention to become pregnant may have changed in that period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CHARM coverage of FP-related information was high, lack of assessment regarding GE-related information impedes our understanding of quality and consistency of delivery of those components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We must also note that the evaluation leadership was involved with the development of the intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the medical college overseeing training and supervision of the CHARM providers, and the providers themselves, were not part of the evaluation team.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the study did not assess indicators of sustainability, such as cost-effectiveness or investment opportunities for sustainability; further work is needed to determine whether broad adoption and implementation of CHARM could be undertaken in rural communities across India.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CHARM intervention, which involves three GE+FP counseling sessions delivered by male health care providers to married men, alone (sessions 1&2) and with their wives (session 3) over three months, appears to be an effective approach to engage men in family planning, improve marital contraceptive communication and use, and reduce male perpetration of sexual IPV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This low intensity intervention, able to be delivered by existing rural medical providers, including non-allopathic private providers, offers a potentially sustainable approach to improve spacing contraceptive use among young couples in rural India and possibly elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The opportunity to involve the private informal sector for this effort in rural India cannot be understated, given that the majority of the primary care in rural India comes from this sector but family planning has not been within their purview [2, 37, 38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intervention may further benefit from more expanded choices for contraceptives and better reach to women for use of more effective contraceptives, given that the current model did not affect highly effective contraceptive use or incident pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greater efforts to include women and provide more effective contraceptives (e.g., intrauterine device- IUD) in future may be facilitated by recent government commitments to support an expansion of more effective contraceptive options in India and ensure universal access to family planning services [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prioritization of innovative approaches such as CHARM to improve family planning in India is timely, as recently released data from multiple Indian states reveal no improvement in contraceptive uptake across the past decade, with some states even demonstrating a decline in modern contraceptive use in this timeframe [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These same data further indicate that health worker outreach to women for family planning promotion has improved in many states, but with no corresponding improvements in contraceptive uptake [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Engaging men as partners to support family planning may be a key to turning the tide in the country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evidence-based CHARM intervention, which capitalizes on the countrys existing rural health infrastructure inclusive of the numerous and accessible private providers, may offer an important means to accelerate improvements in family planning uptake and help India achieve its FP2020 goal of creating 40 million new users of contraception by 2020 [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#
