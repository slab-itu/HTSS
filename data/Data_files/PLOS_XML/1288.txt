Sequence learning modulates neural responses and oscillatory coupling in human and monkey auditory cortex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Learning complex ordering relationships between sensory events in a sequence is fundamental for animal perception and human communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it is known that rhythmic sensory events can entrain brain oscillations at different frequencies, how learning and prior experience with sequencing relationships affect neocortical oscillations and neuronal responses is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used an implicit sequence learning paradigm (an artificial grammar) in which humans and monkeys were exposed to sequences of nonsense words with regularities in the ordering relationships between the words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then recorded neural responses directly from the auditory cortex in both species in response to novel legal sequences or ones violating specific ordering relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neural oscillations in both monkeys and humans in response to the nonsense word sequences show strikingly similar hierarchically nested low-frequency phase and high-gamma amplitude coupling, establishing this form of oscillatory couplingpreviously associated with speech processing in the human auditory cortexas an evolutionarily conserved biological process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, learned ordering relationships modulate the observed form of neural oscillatory coupling in both species, with temporally distinct neural oscillatory effects that appear to coordinate neuronal responses in the monkeys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study identifies the conserved auditory cortical neural signatures involved in monitoring learned sequencing operations, evident as modulations of transient coupling and neuronal responses to temporally structured sensory input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While natural environments constantly change, certain events can predict the future occurrence of others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Learning ordering relationships is vital for animal perception and human communication, yet how such learning and prior experience affect the brain remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set out to understand how learning relationships between words modifies neuronal responses in both humans and monkeys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an implicit learning paradigm, we exposed human subjects and monkeys to sequences of nonsense speech sounds that followed certain rule-based ordering relationships (an artificial grammar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then recorded neural responses directly from the auditory cortex in both species in response to sequences that were either consistent with the artificial grammar or created illegal ordering transitions between elements in a sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that learned ordering relationships modulate a diversity of neural responses (some of which coordinate in similar ways) at the scale of populations of neurons in both species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments in monkeys also revealed that this scale of neural processing is related to single neurons, the fundamental processing unit in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study reveals the conserved neuronal signatures of the auditory cortex involved in monitoring learned sequencing operations, which mechanistically inform and extend ideas on how the brain predicts the sensory world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Natural environments are dynamic and constantly changing, yet certain sensory events can predict the occurrence of others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For any animal to adapt and survive in its environment requires that its brain establish and monitor the predictability of ordering relationships between sensory events, a process that is impaired in neurodevelopmental and other disorders [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that neural oscillations at certain frequencies can entrain to rhythmic sensory inputs, regulating the excitability of neuronal populations [413].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how learning and prior experience with ordering relationships affect neural oscillations and neuronal responses in the sensory neocortex is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequence learning paradigms can be used to comparatively test the sensitivity of human and nonhuman animals to temporal order in sequences of sensory items [1421].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, such experiments begin with an exposure period, during which the participant experiences the regularities between the sensory items in a sequencefor example, listening to a string of legal (consistent) sequences of sounds generated by a rule-based system (i.e., an artificial grammar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exposure phase is thought to elicit implicit learning of the ordering relationships between the sensory items, a form of relational knowledge that does not require perceptual awareness about what was learned [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exposure period is followed by a testing period in which the participant is presented with novel, consistent sequences and violation sequences that have illegal transitions not experienced during exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differential responses to different types of sequence ordering relationships can provide insights into the participants sensitivity and learning strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is growing evidence that following exposure to representative legal sequences, humans and various species of nonhuman animals can recognize ordering relationships between events in a sequence, and there is considerable interest in understanding whether temporal sequence processing capacities are an evolutionary precursor substrate upon which human language evolved [1419, 21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although theoretical models and general comparisons across species point to broadly evolutionarily conserved neural oscillatory processes [6, 7, 2325], there is a paucity of direct comparative evidence in humans and animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct intracranial recordings can occasionally be obtained in humans being monitored for surgery, when the coverage for clinical monitoring overlaps with the research question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to date there has been little common ground in terms of recording sites or tasks across the species, making it difficult to extrapolate insights on neural mechanisms from animal models to humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, certain neural processes involved in segmenting human speech and language [79, 2629] are unlikely to have direct correspondences in nonhuman animals, given that human language is unique in the animal kingdom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for and establish whether neural processes are evolutionarily conserved requires direct comparative neurobiological data obtained under similar tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The goal of this study was to identify and compare the neural oscillatory signatures in the monkey and human auditory cortex in response to sequences of nonsense words and to test whether and how neural responses and oscillations, including single-neuron responses in the monkeys, are modified by the learned between-word relationships established during the preceding exposure period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on neurobiological models of auditory cortical oscillatory processing of speech sounds [26] or sensory-driven entrainment of low-frequency neural oscillations [5, 6], we hypothesized that nonsense word sequences consisting of spectrotemporally complex sounds would elicit low-frequency phase and gamma amplitude coupling in the human and monkey auditory cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the form of neural oscillations or coupling would be similar or different across the species was unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was also difficult to predict how the learned sequencing relationships would affect cortical oscillations or coupling, although some form of impact on low frequency oscillations might be expected [6, 25, 27, 28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we expected that phaseamplitude coupling (PAC), which can capture extrinsic influences [9, 2428], would show evidence of either occurring in tandem or leading corresponding effects on local neurons (i.e., single neurons or populations of neurons, as measured by local field potential power at higher frequencies) during sequence processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show comparable low-frequency (delta and/or theta) phase and high-gamma amplitude coupling in response to the nonsense words in population neural activity recorded directly from the human and monkey auditory cortex, which was robust even with the stimulus-driven response removed from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of this form of nested coupling was strongly modulated by the temporal sequencing regularities in the sequences, as established by the prior exposure period to the ordering relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence-processing effects on oscillatory coupling and single-neuron spiking activity occurred in tandem but preceded effects on local field potential power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensitivity to the sequence ordering relationships was also time sensitive, with, for instance, modulations of oscillatory coupling in response to sequencing relationships consistent with the artificial grammar occurring prior to further modulations of oscillatory coupling in response to violations of sequence ordering relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results inform predictive coding models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study demonstrates that learned sequence ordering relationships modulate neural oscillations in ways that are found to be remarkably similar in the human and monkey auditory cortex and that such oscillatory coupling appears to coordinate local neuronal responses in the primate auditory cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used an artificial grammar learning paradigm that generates sequences of nonsense words with considerable variability in the transitions between elements (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paradigm has been used to identify differences in the sequence processing capabilities of different nonhuman primate species [19] but, critically, appears to be processed comparably by humans and macaques [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used nonsense words because they contain all the spectrotemporal components of speech needed to elicit thetagamma coupling in the human auditory cortex [25, 26] but minimize human lexicalsemantic recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This made for a closer cross-species comparison since the monkeys are likely to treat the nonsense words as complex sounds and/or vocalizations, but they would not be able to attach meaning to them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the transitions between the nonsense word stimuli occur at a lower frequency (~1.8 Hz) than the within-word acoustic features, this allowed us to evaluate whether and how the learned contingencies between the nonsense words would affect the form of neural oscillations seen in both monkeys and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eye-tracking measurements of orienting behavior with the two monkeys that participated in these experiments have previously been used to confirm that the macaques produce longer looking responses to sequences that violated the between-word ordering relationships than to novel, consistent sequences that followed the legal ordering relationships [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, macaques and humans show comparable patterns of behavioral responses to the regularities in the sequences, in particular for adjacent relationships between the nonsense words in the sequences [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During a follow-up visit after the surgical monitoring period, one of the human subjects in this study participated in our behavioral testing paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results confirmed the subjects sensitivity to the sequencing violations (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first presented the monkeys with the exposure set of representative consistent sequences for 30 min (Fig 1 and S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was followed by the testing period, during which we recorded single-unit activity (SUA) from a total of 187 neurons (M1: n = 126; M2: n = 61) and 145 local field potentials (LFPs) (M1: n = 90; M2: n = 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recordings were made from tonotopically localized regions of the auditory cortex (involving primary and surrounding auditory belt regions) as the animals listened to the testing sequences (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The testing sequences were either consistent with the ordering relationships previously heard during exposure or violated a specific ordering relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, the neurobiological effects reported for the sequencing relationships cannot be attributed to acoustic features, since identical nonsense word elements were directly compared in matched pairs of consistent and violation sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the analyses focused on the same acoustical elements (probe stimulus period), prior to which there was either a violation or no violation, which we refer to as the sequencing context (Fig 1C, S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A. Spectrograms of the five nonsense word elements used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paradigm used is based on Wilson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [19] using the artificial grammar of Saffran et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It consists of required (green) and optional (orange) nonsense word elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the illustration, following any of the arrows from start to end generates a legal consistent sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. Example consistent and matching violation sequence comparison pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red box highlights the first illegal sound element in the sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This illustrates how, in the monkeys, local field potential (LFP) and single-unit activity (SUA) data were analyzed using a 1,126 mslong analysis window (probe stimulus analysis window denoted by the horizontal arrow) to include responses to the same two acoustically identical nonsense words (here the F and C elements, gray and red) in the two sequencing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See S1 Fig for all comparison sequence pairs used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D. Illustrated monkey testing trial time course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences consisted of nonsense words (each 413 mslong) separated by a 150-ms interstimulus interval (ISI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sequence was initiated by the monkey fixating on a visual spot on the monitor screen for at least 500 ms, and each sequence was separated by at least a 4,500-ms intertrial interval (ITI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Materials and methods for details on the human experiment using the same materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We first evaluated monkey auditory neural oscillatory responses to the nonsense words, irrespective of the sequencing context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macaque neural responses showed evidence of low-frequency (including theta band) phase alignment and high-gamma power in response to the nonsense words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed significant event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) [31] in response to each of the nonsense words, which were prominent in theta (410 Hz), alpha (1013 Hz), beta (1330 Hz), and high-gamma ( greater than 50 Hz) frequency bands (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant increases in intertrial phase coherence (ITC) were also observed in theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands (bootstrap significance level, p less_than 0.01, Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These phase (ITC) and power (ERSP) oscillatory responses to each of the sounds in the sequence substantiate that the core ingredients are in place to assess low-frequency phase and high-frequency amplitude coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A. Time-frequency representation of local field potential (LFP) cortical responses in the monkey auditory cortex to the nonsense words (all eight sequences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shown is the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The color scale indicates power (in dB) at a given frequency and time relative to the 500-ms baseline prior to sequence onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase consistency was calculated using intertrial phase coherence (ITC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bootstrap statistics (p less_than 0.01) were computed using the same baseline used to calculate the ERSP, and nonsignificant points were colored in green for both ERSP and ITC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. Exemplary phaseamplitude coupling (PAC) in response to the nonsense words for the same data shown in (A) and (B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MI values were z-scaled and shown at each combination of frequency for phase in the x-axis and frequency of amplitude in the y-axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D. The left panels show the modulation index (MI) time course of PAC during the analysis window, extracted from the combinations of amplitude and phase pairs in response to the nonsense words that were above the statistical threshold (p less_than 0.05, Bonferroni correction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results shown here are for the same exemplary LFP site shown in AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thick lines denote the average PAC response across all significant phase and amplitude pairs, and the thin lines show the coupling strength for all phaseamplitude pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The horizontal yellow and green bars above the response curve identify the time of occurrence of the elements in the two types of sequences after the violation onset in the violation sequence or the acoustically identical elements in the corresponding consistent sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The right two panels show difference plots of the time course of oscillatory coupling in response to the violation versus the corresponding consistent sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thick line denotes the average difference calculated from the data on the left.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The horizontal dotted lines denote the CI significance threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vertical dotted line identifies the latency of the first significant effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top panels show an exemplary response with a violation-preferring sequencing context effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottom panels show exemplary response with a consistent-preferring sequencing context effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. Average PAC in response to the nonsense words across all LFP sites in the monkeys (145 LFPs, p less_than 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2000219.g002  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next evaluated whether significant coupling between low-frequency phase and high-frequency amplitude occurs and, if so, what form such coupling takes and whether it can occur with the stimulus-induced response removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated PAC in the LFP signals using a modulation index (MI) to evaluate the strength of coupling between low-frequency phase (38 Hz) and high-frequency power (40200 Hz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vast majority of the LFP sites recorded from the monkey auditory cortex showed robust PAC responses to the nonsense words as low-frequency (38 Hz) phase coupling with gamma ( greater than 40 Hz) amplitude (141/145, 97%; M1: 88/90, 98%; M2: 53/55, 96%, p less_than 0.05, Bonferroni corrected; Fig 2C and 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach ensured that the results cannot be easily attributed to stimulus-evoked responses since we removed the stimulus-driven component from contributing to the analyses (see Materials and methods, S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, to evaluate the impact of the sequencing context on thetagamma coupling (i.e., oscillatory coupling in response to the nonsense words), the time course of MI values was extracted from the cluster of pixels showing PAC in response to the nonsense words under the two sequencing conditions (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 141 LFP sites that showed significant PAC effects in response to nonsense words, 53% (75 LFPs, M1: 47/88, 53%; M2: 28/53, 53%) showed that the sequencing context significantly modulated PAC coupling (p less_than 0.05, Bonferroni corrected; Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exemplary site in Fig 2D shows that violations of the sequencing order (i.e., a transition that never occurred during the exposure period) strongly modulated coupling between low-frequency phase and gamma amplitude at specific times from ~450 ms after the violation to ~700 ms; this is a time period covering the subsequent two sounds after the sequencing violation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The modulation of PAC seemed to occur independently of any stimulus-evoked, ERP-driven, or time-locked ITC during the same probe stimulus period (see S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation provides additional evidence that the observed modulation of PAC reflects a sequencing contextrelated effect rather than one that is purely stimulus driven.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out of 75 sites, the largest proportion (34/75; 45%) showed greater PAC responses to violation sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a considerable number of sites also showed greater PAC responses to consistent sequences (31/75; 41%) and responses to both types of sequencing contexts (10/75; 13%), the latter evident as significant deviations from chance variability in PAC for either context at different time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, the form of low-frequency phase and high-gamma amplitude coupling observed in monkeys in this study resembles that obtained in previous intracranial results in humans [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is difficult to directly compare our monkey results to this pioneering work in humans, as it relied on word recognition tasks that can only be conducted in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, regions including and around the primary auditory cortex (Heschls gyrus [HG]) were not assessed, which would better correspond to the regions that were recorded here in the monkeys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For more direct cross-species comparisons, we recorded from two human patients being monitored for surgery who had depth electrodes in HG as part of their clinical treatment plan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used auditory stimulation sequences identical to those in the monkey experiments for both exposure and testing (see Materials and methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The human neural oscillations recorded in HG showed striking similarities to the results obtained from the monkey auditory cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed increased gamma power and ITC in the low-frequency range in response to the nonsense words (compare human Fig 3A and 3B to monkey Fig 2A and 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, 81% (13/16) of the contacts in human HG showed significant low-frequency phase and gamma amplitude coupling (p less_than 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) in response to the nonsense words (human subject 1 [H1]: 6/8 = 75%; H2: 7/8 = 88%; Fig 3C3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out of 13 LFP recording sites in HG, 10 sites (77%) showed significant modulation of phaseamplitude coupling in response to the sequencing context (effects in at least one of the stimulus sequence pairs; H1: 5/6 = 75%; H2: 5/7 = 88%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is seen as low-frequency-to-gamma coupling that is dynamically modulated over time after a sequencing violation (Fig 3D right panels, p less_than 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected; significant modulation as a function of the sequencing context).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of mixed types of context-dependent PAC responses (Fig 2D), as was seen in the monkey results, was also observed in the humans; out of 10 sites that showed significant context-dependent PAC responses, 30% (3/10) showed significant PAC in response to the violation sequences, 40% (4/10) showed greater response to the consistent sequence, and 30% (3/10) showed significant PAC modulation to both types of sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed PAC effects varied across the gamma frequency range and did not show clear topographical relationships in response to the two sequencing conditions across the recorded sites in the human or monkey auditory cortex (S1 Text, S4 Fig, S5 Fig and S6 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, a control experiment in another human subject (H3) provides some support for the notion that effects on PAC are stronger when the participant experiences exposure to statistically structured sequences rather than those with unstructured transitions between the sound elements (S2 Text, S7 Fig, S1 Table and S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The number of recording contacts in humans is limited, and access to single units was not possible; thus, using monkeys as a model system, with a more substantial sampling of population and single neuronal responses, we conducted further analyses that link the fundamental scale of neuronal processing in the brain to results obtained at the other neural scales (i.e., local field potentials and oscillatory coupling; Fig 4 and Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of local field potential and single-unit responses confirmed the relatively late auditory neuronal sensitivities to the sequencing context seen with oscillatory coupling responses ( greater than 600 ms), and the results substantiated the observation of different subpopulations of responses sensitive to either the consistent or violating ordering relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across the 145 LFP sites, the proportion of responses to the sequencing context (differential violation versus consistent responses during the acoustically matched sequence pairs in the probe stimulus analysis window) were significantly different for high gamma (violation versus consistent, 2 = 4.9, p less_than 0.03, n = 36) but not for theta and low gamma oscillations (theta: 2 = 0.44, p  greater than  0.50, n = 36; low gamma: 2 = 0.1, p  greater than  0.70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is seen as a relatively even split in theta and low-gamma LFP power (Fig 4C) and SUA (Fig 5C) in response to the violation or consistent sequences, with high-gamma responses tending to be more prominent in response to the violation sequencing context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we analyzed the strength of the sequencing context effect in the LFP and SUA data in terms of their magnitude and duration (Fig 4 and Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis showed that all neuronal LFP power and SUA responses to the sequencing context had substantial breach durations (~40 ms) above the significance threshold (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]; high gamma, 42 ± 5.7 ms, n = 40; low gamma, 41 ± 4.6 ms, n = 40; theta, 45 ± 5.2 ms, n = 36; SUA, 40 ± 2.8 ms, n = 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-gamma power, in particular, showed a significantly greater average response magnitude to the violation context than to the consistent sequencing context (Fig 5D; 52 ± 7.8 ms versus 24 ± 1.5 ms, violation versus consistent, p less_than 0.02, Wilcoxon rank-sum test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed sequencing context effect appears to be independent of the differential response to the sounds prior to the probe stimulus window, since there was no significant correlation between the magnitude of the high-gamma response to the sound preceding the violation transition and the magnitude of the context-sensitive response during the probe stimulus window (r = 0.14, p = 0.54, Pearson correlation; see S3 Text and S8 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate whether the various neural response measures differed in the latency of their responses to the sequencing context (Fig 6), we used an ANOVA with the response latencies as the dependent variable and the factors monkey, sequencing context, and type of neuronal response (PAC, LFP across three frequency bands, and SUA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis revealed a main effect of neuronal response type (F4, 221 = 2.776, p less_than 0.03) with no interactions (all p  greater than  0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post-hoc comparisons showed that PAC response latencies were comparable to those in the SUA but were significantly shorter than responses based purely on LFP power (Fig 6; Fishers least significant difference [LSD], p less_than 0.03).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the PAC sensitivity latencies were significantly later in response to violation sequences than to consistent sequences (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study identifies the auditory cortical neural signatures associated with monitoring learned sequence ordering relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oscillatory coupling in response to the nonsense words and sequence ordering relationships are seen to be remarkably similar in humans and monkeys, and these results are further informed by local field potential and single-neuron responses in the monkeys as a model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After exposing humans and monkeys to rule-based, nonsense word sequences, we demonstrated the following: (i) transient low-frequency neural oscillatory phase couples with high-gamma band amplitude in response to the nonsense word sequences in the auditory cortex, which was robust even with the stimulus-evoked response removed; (ii) the previously experienced temporal ordering relationships modulate neuronal responses and oscillatory coupling after a violation transition (~450700 ms); (iii) oscillatory coupling effects occurred in tandem with spiking activity (single neuron) responses and led effects in local field potential power; and (iv) neural responses to the sequence ordering relationships were time sensitive, with, for example, oscillatory coupling responses occurring early in time to consistent sequencing relationships prior to further modulations of oscillatory coupling in response to violations of the sequence ordering relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evolutionarily_conserved_nested_oscillatory_coupling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results appear to address any remaining uncertainty regarding whether human nested coupling in response to complex sounds, such as speech, is at all like the auditory cortical coupling elicited by the same type of stimuli in other animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  General cross-species correspondences between neuronal oscillations in rodents, monkeys, and humans have been noted (e.g., [23]) and are taken as evidence of broadly evolutionarily conserved oscillatory processes and mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A prominent neurophysiological model of auditory cortical segmentation of speech [7, 9, 26] postulates that auditory cortical oscillations are entrained by the multi-timescale structure in speech sounds (e.g., phonemic, syllabic).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Speech syllables entrain low-frequency theta oscillations (48 Hz), which in turn couple with high-frequency ( greater than 30 Hz) gamma amplitude, regulating neuronal excitability and segmenting speech into an appropriate temporal granularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, studies in nonhuman animals have reported auditory cortex activity that is phase-locked to the temporal envelope of complex sounds, including vocalizations [10, 32], speech syllables [33], and natural sounds [11, 34], although not always at theta-band frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the lack of direct comparisons between humans and nonhuman animals has left the comparisons and relationships to single-neuron responses tentative and the issue unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that nested neuronal coupling to nonsense words is remarkably similar across the species, and effects occur in tandem with single-unit responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cross-species observations raise the important question of what are the neurobiological processes supporting human speech perception, if complex sound segmentation is seen to be a general property of neural processing within and around the primary auditory cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Part of the answer might be that downstream processes, such as those in the human superior temporal gyrus and sulcus, support more speech perceptionspecific representations [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since speech production and perception are unique to humans, it is unlikely that nonhuman primates perceived the nonsense words differently to other complex natural sounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With training, monkeys and rodents can learn to discriminate speech [36, 37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For our paradigm, it is critical that the monkeys and humans are able to perceptually distinguish the different nonsense words in order to recognize the ordering relationships [19, 21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because of their experience with speech and language, humans might process the phonotactic content (and other aspects of speech) contained within the nonsense words differently than would monkeys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, given these and other unavoidable differences in testing the two species or how they might perceive the stimuli, the similarities in the form of nested coupling seen in the human and monkey auditory cortex are all the more remarkable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our human oscillatory coupling results in response to speech sounds are generally consistent with those from the initial report of thetagamma coupling in human intracranial recordings [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prior study used word recognition tasks, leaving uncertain the extent to which sublexical stimulus features are sufficient to evoke thetagamma coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accumulating evidence from this and other studies support the notion that theta signal modulation and thetagamma coupling can arise as a function of speech-related processing [3840], which, as we show, is evident in human and monkey neuronal oscillations within the auditory cortex even with stimulus-driven responses removed from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These oscillations are further modulated by learning and mnemonic operations, as we now consider.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

By design, we used violations of specific sequencing relationships to ensure that the subsequent probe stimulus period that was analyzed across the violation and consistent sequence pairs contained the same acoustical elements that were being compared across the conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the contribution of pure stimulus entrainment in the observed PAC should be equal across the conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note also that the wavelet filtering across the two sequence conditions was identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also confirmed that initial stimulus-driven, pure power or phase effects cannot easily explain the results, since we removed the trial-by-trial evoked stimulusresponse from the LFP signals (see S3 Fig, Materials and methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, to rule out potential artificial PAC coupling, which can occur for a number of reasons [41], we used phase-clustering correction [42] and trial-shuffled permutation testing before calculating PAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond the PAC elicited by the nonsense words, we observed that PAC was sensitive to the sequence learning context, seen as dynamic modulation of the PAC for a substantial amount of time after a violation transition (~450700 ms over the next two sounds in the sequence), which can occur independently of any stimulus time-locked phase coherence (S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a parsimonious general explanation of the results is that non-stimulusdriven effects are responsible for the observed PAC of neuronal oscillations in both the human and monkey auditory cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analyses in relation to SUA responses suggest that oscillatory coupling occurs in tandem with single neuronal responses, with effects on populations of local neurons (i.e., time-averaged LFP gamma power) activity following (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The between-word transitions in our sequences occurred at a regular 1.8 Hz rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, one prediction is that monitoring the sequencing transitions would entrain low-frequency delta oscillations and affect the form of nested oscillations to more strongly involve a delta component [6, 29, 39, 4346].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our analysis could only measure as low as 3 Hz, the observed PAC effects are clearly not specific to delta (less_than4 Hz), however, involving also theta (48 Hz) phase coupling with gamma amplitude (S1 Text and S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence learning effects on theta, in particular, at least on the surface appear to resemble those shown for other learning or mnemonic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, theta oscillations in the auditory cortex measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG) are modulated during speech recognition when speech is comprehensible [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, when participants monitor syntactic properties in sentences and store certain relationships in memory, electroencephalography (EEG)-based theta frequencies are modulated in frontoparietal brain regions [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some of the neuronal effects related to sequence learning reported here could be intrinsic to the auditory cortex, given that rapid, learning-related, receptive field plasticity occurs in the auditory cortex [47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that the auditory cortex interacts with a broader network of regions, and we consider some likely candidate regions and physiological processes involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it is broadly accepted that the hippocampus is important for encoding and retrieval during explicit forms of learning and memory [13, 48, 49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent evidence using implicit (statistical or associative) learning tasks has raised the interesting possibility that the hippocampus is also involved in more implicit forms of learning, assisting in evaluating previously learned associations in relation to novel incoming input [5053].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hippocampus also has intrinsic neuronal oscillations in the theta-frequency band that can be modulated by learning and memory [5461].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, hippocampal neuronal oscillations seem to be important for sampling temporally discrete sequential events [13], processes that are modulated by cognitive operations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Much less is known about the role of the sensory cortex, especially with regards to how the monitoring of previously experienced sequencing relationships impact on neuronal oscillations and coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings of auditory neuronal spiking responses in songbirds using a statistical learning paradigm showed stronger responses to novel low-probability transitions versus familiar sequences [62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the monkey inferior temporal cortex, neurons adapt their responses to an image whose presence is predicted by a leading image [63], and the neurons respond more strongly to the image not predicted by the preceding image(s) [64].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a study in rodents using a fixed ABCD sequence of visual gratings at different orientations showed strong potentiation in response to the familiar predictable sequence in the rat primary visual cortex in relation to sequences with unpredictable transitions between the stimuli [65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work could help to reconcile and extend some of these seemingly discrepant findings across brain regions and species: we see similar neuronal responses and oscillatory signatures in humans and macaques associated with previously experienced sequence ordering relationships that are seen prominently, but not exclusively, for violations of sequencing relationships (Fig 4 and Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relatively late sensitivity to the sequencing relationships is an interesting observation, since it is generally consistent with the approximate time of behavioral eye-tracking sensitivity in response to specific violations to these sorts of sequencing relationships (~600 ms) [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, using the same stimuli and paradigm as the ones used here, monkey EEG results showed a late event-related positivity at ~500 ms ([66], also see [67]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results establish the primate auditory cortex as an important site for monitoring previously experienced sequence ordering relationships, whereby specific violations to the ordering relationships modulate nested coupling at a time when the effects appear to be behaviorally meaningful and seem to elicit large-scale event-related potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, structured sequence learning is related to but not equivalent to grammatical violations in natural language, which in humans are known to elicit late effects in EEG potentials such as the P600 [68, 69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, our study shows an approach for identifying the auditory cortical correlates of certain EEG or MEG responses, some of which might have hierarchically nested coupling as an underlying mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans these processes can be compared with natural language operations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The auditory cortical effects that we observe occur later than other types of contextual auditory cortical effects [70], raising the question of which brain regions are interacting with the sensory cortex to elicit these learning-related effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hippocampus is a good candidate, as we considered above, and neural processes in this region also show relatively late sensitivity to violations of other types of sequence ordering relationships (300600 ms) [71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we predict that the ventral frontal cortex plays a key role in monitoring sequence order for previously learned relationships [72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, a recent comparative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in monkeys and humans using the same paradigm showed that the ventral frontal and opercular cortex is consistently engaged across participants and in both species in response to violations of the ordering relationships [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, possibly because of the mixed subpopulations of different types of neuronal responses that the current study identified in the auditory cortex, the involvement of the auditory cortex was not clear in the prior comparative fMRI study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was the case even with the fMRI data reanalyzed here, focusing specifically on the human and monkey auditory cortex (S4 Text and S9 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our monkey neurophysiological data provided more systematic coverage of SUA and LFP activity in the auditory cortex than was possible with the human neural recordings, revealing a dichotomy of neuronal response types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These combined observations are difficult to explain by early stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) because of the rather late occurrence of the effects that we see (~600 ms), but see the long-lasting effects reported by Yaron and colleagues [73].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, rapid SSA effects would elicit a reduction in neuronal responses to stimulus regularities [74, 75], whereas we also see stronger responses to the legal (consistent) versus violation sequences in a subpopulation of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find evidence for different types of neuronal responses across scales (Fig 4C), with mainly high gamma showing significantly greater magnitude and proportions of responses to the violation sequencing context (Fig 4C and Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These aspects of the results appear to be more comparable to the potentiation of neuronal responses to predictable stimulus transitions, as seen in the rodent primary visual cortex [65], although, again, it is worth noting that the effects here occur well after stimulus onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The predictive coding theory of brain function can potentially explain and be informed by our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predictive coding models of perception posit that low-frequency prediction signals from hierarchically higher areas are compared with incoming sensory information from hierarchically lower areas, generating high-frequency error signals in the form of gamma oscillations that are fed forward to higher areas [7679].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results on oscillatory coupling and the observation of a more prominent high-gamma signal in response to violation sequences (Fig 5) are generally consistent with these models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Innovation is provided here by the observation of fundamental interactions between low- and high-frequency oscillations as a function of learned sequencing relationships likely encoded via intrinsic auditory cortical interactions with other areas of the brain (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such interactions are a possible manifestation of the gamma error signal from a lower-frequency (possibly beta band) prediction input [77, 78].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, theta and/or alpha oscillations have also recently been shown to relate in magnitude to the precision of higher predictions [79] and as a feed-forward process in the primate visual pathway [78, 80], indicating wider roles for these low-frequency oscillations than acknowledged in current theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhanced low-frequency oscillations may therefore be important for strengthening the gamma prediction error signal for learned sequencing operations on sensory input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, informing predictive coding models, we discovered a candidate physical mechanism for comparing ongoing prediction signals with incoming sensory information, based on PAC that is delayed beyond the PAC directly resulting from the signal itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is illustrated in Fig 7, whereby prediction signals, induced here by the processing of consistent sequencing relationships, lag those associated with stimulus onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When there is a prediction error (in our case, a response to a sequencing order violation) there is a further modulation of PAC and local neuronal processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies could seek to establish the feed-forward and feedback interactions that may occur between the sensory cortex and other brain regions, including specifying the cortical layers where the reported effects occur [81, 82].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work here provides the framework for such pursuits that can now strongly benefit from studies in animal models to complement and extend the observations that can be obtained from intracranial recordings in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, the findings support the notion that hierarchically nested oscillations, such as thetagamma coupling in response to complex sounds, reflect general auditory physiological processes in primates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the human and monkey auditory cortex show the neural signatures of learning- or experience-based sequence monitoring in the form of modulations of transient, low-frequency (including theta) oscillations coupling with gamma and concomitant effects in single neurons and populations of neurons at specific times as a function of the predictability of the sequence ordering relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall the results imply that these processes are unlikely to have evolved, at least at this level, in a uniquely specialized manner in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The described physiological processes inform neurobiological research on the neural bases of learning and predictive coding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work opens the door for more systematic study of the mechanisms for these processes in animal models with more direct comparisons to neural processes in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) in response to the violation (left) and consistent (right) sequences during the same probe stimulus analysis window as in A-C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If stimulus-driven phase resetting leads to PAC, the ITC shown in E should be the same for the two sequencing conditions, given that the two elements during the probe stimulus analysis window are acoustically identical for both the violation and consistent sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note however that PAC results typically do not show a similar phase clustering in time as the ITC, which is earlier and will pick up stimulus driven phase coherence (compare the results for PAC in panels C to the ITC results in panel E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the sequencing context elicited PAC appears to be independent of the stimulus-driven time-locked component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Reconstructed image of the location of the depth electrode placement on the left HG for H3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C-D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resulting PAC response during the first testing session after exposure to random transitions in the sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of sites (3/5) showed significant phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in response to the nonsense words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An exemplary response is shown in C for channel 57, whereas the majority of the sites (4/5) showed no significant sequencing context effect (consistent vs. violation, see exemplary PAC response in D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure format is the same as in Fig 2C and 2D and Fig 3C3F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resulting PAC responses during the second testing session after exposure to legal AGL sequences (same as the ones used in the main experiment reported in the manuscript: see exposure AGL set of sequences in the Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the sites (5/5) showed significant PAC in response to the nonsense words (an exemplary response is shown in E for channel 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the sites (3/5) also showed significant sequencing context effects (an exemplary response is shown in F for channel 56 where a significant consistent sequence preference is seen with a sensitivity latency of 900 ms (the earlier violation sequence sensitivity did not breach for long enough to be significant by the joint magnitude and duration criteria (see Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

S8_Fig_Correlation_analysis_between_the_magnitude_of_the_response_to_the_sounds_preceding_the_probe_stimulus_window_(x-axis)_and_the_magnitude_of_the_sequencing_context_effect_during_the_probe_stimulus_(y-axis)_for_LFP_power  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data from high-gamma, low-gamma, and theta bands are displayed here together as the results were comparable for the separate frequency bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant correlations were seen in these analyses (all p  greater than  0.1) between the sequencing context response and the magnitude of the response to the acoustically different sounds preceding the probe stimulus (where the acoustical items were identical and during which the sequencing context response was calculated).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The analyses performed in Wilson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2015 [20]) report no significant activation to the violation vs consistent contrast within auditory cortex in either the macaque or human data at a cluster corrected significance threshold (p less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we looked for subthreshold sensitivity, as follows: A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean activation (Z-score) to the violation vs consistent contrast was calculated across primary auditory cortex (field A1) for each of the macaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses revealed limited and variable activation patterns across the macaques tested, and none of the macaques showed differential activation to the violation vs consistent sequences that exceeded even a very liberal significance threshold (uncorrected p = 0.05 corresponding to Z = 1.96; see dotted lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M1 is the same animal studied in this electrophysiological report.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of the anatomical ROI used for these analyses in the macaque auditory cortex (field A1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. Human medial Heschls gyrus also showed no significant differential activation to the violation vs consistent contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D. Location of the anatomical ROI used in the human fMRI data analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See manuscript text for discussion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
