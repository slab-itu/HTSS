A New Species of the Bay Goby Genus Eucyclogobius, Endemic to Southern California: Evolution, Conservation, and Decline  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A geographically isolated set of southern localities of the formerly monotypic goby genus Eucyclogobius is known to be reciprocally monophyletic and substantially divergent in mitochondrial sequence and nuclear microsatellite-based phylogenies relative to populations to the north along the California coast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To clarify taxonomic and conservation status, we conducted a suite of analyses on a comprehensive set of morphological counts and measures from across the range of Eucyclogobius and describe the southern populations as a new species, the Southern Tidewater Goby, Eucyclogobius kristinae, now separate from the Northern Tidewater Goby Eucyclogobius newberryi (Girard 1856).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to molecular distinction, adults of E. kristinae are diagnosed by: 1) loss of the anterior supratemporal lateral-line canals resulting in higher neuromast counts, 2) lower pectoral and branched caudal ray counts, and 3) sets of measurements identified via discriminant analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences suggest ecological distinction of the two species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies estimated lineage separation at 24 million years ago, and mitochondrial sequence divergence exceeds that of other recognized fish species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fish from Santa Monica Artesian Springs (Los Angeles County) northward belong to E. newberryi; those from Aliso Creek (Orange County) southward constitute E. kristinae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lagoonal habitat of Eucyclogobius has been diminished or degraded, leading to special conservation status at state and federal levels beginning in 1980.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Habitat of the newly described species has been impacted by a range of anthropogenic activities, including the conversion of closing lagoons to open tidal systems in the name of restoration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the last 30 years, E. kristinae has only been observed in nine intermittently occupied lagoonal systems in northern San Diego County; it currently persists in only three sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the new species is in imminent danger of extinction and will require ongoing active management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
General  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The monotypic goby genus Eucyclogobius Gill, 1862, type Gobius newberryi Girard, 1856[1], was described based on specimens from northern California, in or near Walker Creek in Tomales Bay [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eucyclogobius was known exclusively from central and northern California prior to 1939, the year it was first collected from coastal California south of the Los Angeles plain [5,6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These small fish inhabit coastal stream-mouth lagoons and bay-margin ponded water habitats of variable, but often low, salinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these habitats Eucyclogobius exhibits local persistence in isolation in some areas, but local extirpation and recolonization with limited local marine dispersal [7,8] in others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional salient features of Eucyclogobius include reversal of typical sex roles and sexual dimorphism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The males dig burrows where they guard fertilized eggs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females engage in competition for males where they conduct colorful display rituals at the entrance of the male-occupied burrow prior to egg laying and fertilization [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The range of Eucyclogobius extends the length of California from Del Norte to San Diego counties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gaps in this distribution occur in central and northern California where steep, rocky coasts preclude coastal lagoon formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such rocky shores separate distinct phylogeographic clades that are evident in both mitochondrial and microsatellite analyses [1012].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These clades served as the basis for management units in the U.S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fish and Wildlife Service Recovery Plan [13,14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, variable reduction of the sensory canals of the head is known to closely parallel these phylogeographic units [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Observation of habitat loss through the 1970s and 80s in the face of coastal development and drought, combined with natural history studies [9,13,14,16] suggesting the possibility of genetic subdivision, led to state listing as a species of concern in 1980 and ultimately to federal listing as an endangered species in 1994 [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent work has confirmed deep genetic subdivision [1012].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sites are genetically distinct from one another at very short distances along the coast [17,18,19], making this the most locally genetically subdivided vertebrate on the North American Pacific Coast [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple lines of evidence support the role of ecology and closed lagoon habitat preference in the generation of this remarkable local genetic differentiation: 1) Recolonization of formerly uninhabited sites coincides with high winter runoff events [7,8] and occurs over distances that are generally less than 10 km, primarily along sandy coasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) Adults tolerate high salinity levels [16] yet larvae and small juveniles are intolerant of marine salinity [20,21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3) Deep genetic divergence occurs across headlands and rocky substrate [1012,18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination, these factors suggest that larvae remain isolated in closed lagoons or fresher water settings, and that adults disperse over soft-sediment substrates near the shore following flood opening of lagoons to the sea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This very limited mode of intermittent dispersal contributes to genetic differentiation and endangerment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic divergence between southern populations and those to the north is much higher than that among still substantially subdivided units of the northern species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, despite challenges presented by sexual dimorphism, allometric growth, and low degree of morphological differentiation, morphological characters reveal consistent differences in both counted and measured characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These distinctions and their implications for historical ecology, conservation, and recovery are outlined here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Taxonomy_and_Phylogenetic_Placement_of_the_Genus_Eucyclogobius  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The genus Eucyclogobius has been recognized as monotypic or included as a subgenus with other genera of North Pacific Bay Gobies of the North American coast in an expanded genus Lepidogobius, the oldest available name for these related northeastern Pacific gobies (see synonymy below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They share morphological and molecular characters (synapomorphies) with other genera of North Pacific Bay Gobies in Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination, these form a North Pacific temperate group of gobies that was initially subdivided by Birdsong et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [22] into two ecologically distinct informal groupings; Chasmichthys, (normally proportioned benthic or demersal gobies) and Astrabe (elongate infaunal/interstitial gobies with reduced eyes), based on the northwestern Pacific genera Chasmichthys and Astrabe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birdsong et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [22] supported the overall monophyly of the North Pacific Bay Gobies on the pattern of dorsal fin pterygiophore placement in relation to the vertebrae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thacker [23,24] provided molecular support for this combined Chasmichthys + Astrabe group based on a limited number of taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genera sampled from this group fall within the subfamily Gobionellinae [2527], family Gobionellidae [23,24], or as gobionelline-like gobiids [28] largely based on DNA sequence data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ellingson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [29] and Ellingson [30] provided a comprehensive multi-locus phylogenetic analysis of this North Pacific group, demonstrating its monophyly and that the clade is subdivided into eastern and western temperate North Pacific sister clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrated that the elongate Astrabe morphology present in multiple genera on both coasts is a product of convergent evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ellingson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [29] confirmed the placement of Eucyclogobius within the eastern Pacific Bay Gobies, and that the genus Eucyclogobius is sister to the wide-ranging monotypic East Pacific genus Clevelandia as first reported by Dawson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prior_Phylogeographic_and_Morphologic_Evidence_of_Species-level_Distinction_of_Eucyclogobius_in_Southern_California  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dawson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10] documented 4% mitochondrial sequence divergence of the southernmost clade that historically occupied San Diego and Orange County, California, and inferred a divergence time of 2 to 4 million years ago (Mya).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phylogeny, based on DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial control region (D-loop) and cytochrome b gene, placed northern and southern samples into deeply divergent reciprocally monophyletic clades with high bootstrap support (see Figure 3 in reference [10]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earl et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [12] used 24 microsatellite loci to generate a nuclear phylogeography of Eucyclogobius and recovered a very similar tree topology to the Dawson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10] mitochondrial tree, with comparable reciprocal monophyly between north and south.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The southernmost clade was the most distinct based on branch length, as well as dramatic differentiation of allele repeat number at the microsatellite loci themselves [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earl et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [12] also highlighted the greater divergence of E. kristinae relative to other canonical endangered species such as Desert Pupfish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work [31] confirms that named pupfish species are orders of magnitude more recent in their divergence than the Eucyclogobius species described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ahnelt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [15] determined that the southern branch of the Eucyclogobius phylogeographic tree was morphologically divergent and diagnostically distinct based on characters associated with reduction of sensory canal features of the head.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, deeply divergent nuclear and mitochondrial molecular features as well as morphological distinctions have already been established in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic markers also reveal substantially less variation within E. kristinae relative to E. newberryi, suggesting small effective population size and underscoring the importance of recognition and conservation of the geographically restricted southern species described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Challenges_for_the_Morphologic_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The morphologic work presented here, particularly regarding morphometrics as opposed to meristics, has challenging aspects that are of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Challenges result from 1) constraints on sample size due to the limited museum material available for study, 2) sexual dimorphism of these small fish, 3) the interaction of size, shape, and sex on different characters (despite the selection of adult fish for the analysis), 4) inter clade and population variation, especially in E. newberryi (where we have samples across the range and from all distinct clades), and 5) the modest morphologic differences between the species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After exploring a range of approaches, including principal components analysis, to examine the numerous measured characters, we settled on two analytical schemes, each is distinct in approach and purpose: a multivariate discriminate function analysis (DFA), and an appraisal of each character using generalized linear models (GLMs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination, they provide a comprehensive assessment of the measured character differences between species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our view, even in the absence of morphological differences, E. kristinae would merit species designation due to the nuclear and mitochondrial reciprocal monophyly combined with temporal divergence of the lineages (1112).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use this combination of tools to identify characters that are distinct and provide the capacity to morphologically diagnose the species, while we also explore the morphologic variation associated with size, sex, and species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We employed discriminate function analysis (DFA) to identify variables that efficiently discriminate between the two species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In preparation for this analysis, we performed a global transformation of all measured variables that normalized for body size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this approach was not dependent on any particular measure to determine size (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  standard length), effectively dealing with the issue of size in an unbiased way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our second analytical scheme involved treating each measured character independently in a generalized linear model (GLM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed models for each measurement, as well as visualization of the data, revealed association of each character with standard length, species, and sex as well as their interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach provided a good understanding of how each measured variable was behaving, and permitted a better understanding of distinctions between species as well as preliminary inferences about ecological differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assessment of statistical significance for both morphometric and meristic differences between species was restricted to alpha level (p0.001), and no other adjustments for multiple sampling were made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both classes of variables were inspected to determine whether inter-population variation rendered them imperfectly diagnostic between species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Counts_and_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Forty-seven morphometric measurements (Figs 1 and 2), thirteen fin ray counts (Fig 3), twenty-eight cephalic neuromast line counts (Fig 4), and one count each of gill rakers, vertebrae, and shoulder papillae were analyzed on upwards of 145 specimens from throughout the range of Eucyclogobius (see S1 Table for all counts and measures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No animal care protocols were required as all measurements were taken on preserved museum material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meristic counts were taken on an additional 88 specimens and 23 of the original syntypes of E. newberryi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Count protocols follow Hubbs and Lagler [32] unless otherwise noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counts of the second dorsal and anal fins include the first flexible unsegmented and unbranched spine as well as the following segmented and branched rays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We counted procurrent caudal rays (not segmented), segmented unbranched rays, and segmented branched caudal rays both dorsally and ventrally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many vertebral and fin ray counts (except pectoral and pelvic rays) were taken from X-rays, and the last half-centrum bearing the urostyle is included in the vertebral counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both free neuromasts and presumptive canal neuromasts, where canals were not developed, were counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lines or groups of neuromasts reflect a history of annotation from symbols of Sanzo [33], Wongrat and Miller [34], and Anhelt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our number (which corresponds with the illustration in Fig 4A) is followed here by a letter in parentheses corresponding to Anhelt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [15], NL indicates rows not shown by Anhelt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  : 1 (s); 2(d); 3(c); 4(b); 5(ot); 6(z); 7(a); 8(x1); 9(x2); 10(as1); 11(os); 12(oi); 13(NL); 14(NL); 15(NL); 16(NL); 17(NL); 18(r); 19(u1); 20(tra); 21(u2); 22(q); 23(n); 24(la2); 25(la2); 26(o); 27(c2); 28(g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two large organs (one above the other) along the upper edge of the preopercle were constant and not counted (i3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We did not determine patterns of nervous innervation nor utilize the innervations-based terminology of Wongrat and Miller [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extent of scale investment was assessed without counting the small, imbedded, and non-overlapping scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were taken with dial calipers to the nearest 0.1 mm under a dissecting microscope and most fish were above 30 mm standard length (SL), with 15% being between 25 and 30 mm SL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in pigmentary features could not be discerned in the fixed material examined and were not compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarities as well as morphological and genetic differences between the species are discussed under E. kristinae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mapping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Verified records for both species are mapped based on museum specimens or other reliable documentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See S1 Text for treatment of each locality mapped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Four localities reported once but not documented by specimen records, or other information to provide definitive confirmation, are not plotted on the maps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They may be valid historical sites lacking Tidewater Gobies today: San Pedro, Los Angeles County reported by Eigenmann and Eigenmann in 1892 [36]; San Elijo Lagoon, San Diego County [37]; Carquinez Straits, upper San Francisco Bay [38], and Lake Merritt, Alameda County (visual records in the last few years by Jim Carlson as related verbally to Peter Moyle, in lit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21 April 1975).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Synonymies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prior to observations of Eucyclogobius south of the Los Angeles Basin in 1939 and 1940 mention of Tidewater Gobies refer to the Northern Tidewater Goby E. newberry as delimited here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synonymy in the main text includes, primary systematic treatments, misidentifications, and the synonymy of E. kristinae only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more comprehensive compilation of synonymy and valid literature references for the genus and both species is appended (S2 Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Counts and measurements were analyzed with approaches mitigating the influence of size, sexual dimorphism [9], sampling limitations, as well as the local variation in morphology already known to exist [15] between the multiple lesser genetic subdivisions within Eucyclogobius newberryi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the multivariate approach, discriminant function analysis (DFA), all measurements were globally transformed to eliminate the overall effect of size, and eliminate the specific reliance on a single measure to assess size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separate DFAs were performed for species, sex, and species for each sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measured characters were then assessed individually without transformation using generalized linear models (GLMs) to understand the influence of effects of standard length, species, sex, and interactive terms for each character.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This permitted identification of allometric relationships, not revealed in the discriminant approach and permitted identification of additional covariates excluded as redundant in species discrimination, but of interest in a more wholistic understanding of species difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Counts included fin spines and rays, vertebrae, and neuromast lines on the head and were treated independently from one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each was assessed for statistical difference between species using a non-parametric approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counted characters determined to be distinct at the 0.001p level between species was then further assessed to determine if all sampled localities were diagnosed effectively to species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, previous efforts to reconstruct the phylogeny and timing of divergence within East Pacific Bay Gobies [29,30] were analyzed to generate specific estimates of the divergence time of Eucyclogobius newberryi and Eucyclogobius kristinae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Endangered_Status  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Endangered_Status_of_Eucyclogobius  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The state and federal special conservation status designations of Eucyclogobius newberryi was based on the loss of many populations then hypothesized, and later confirmed by genetic studies, to be relatively isolated and rarely capable of recolonization over more than 1015 km of coastline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both natural and artificial loss of intervening habitat has further separated populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual lagoonal populations of both species face increasing threats of isolation from both natural and anthropogenic events, as well as predation and/or competition from invasive species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One or more of these factors can quickly and unpredictably eliminate a population despite the seasonal presence of large numbers of individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sea-level rise driven by climate change is predicted to further adversely affect both species [115,116].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combination of threats indicates both species should continue to receive protection until objectives of the Recovery Plan are met [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During three years of intense drought from 20132015, central and southern California populations of both species have experienced numerous extirpations (see Mapping above; Spies and Jacobs, unpublished).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The special conservation status of both species at the state and federal levels should be retained, and care should be taken to preserve overall genetic diversity, as well as the geographically separated and genetically differentiated populations and metapopulation units [12], Thus the description of a southern species does not undercut the significance of the isolated genetic units within E. newberryi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Southern Tidewater Goby, Eucyclogobius kristinae, has a history of genetic isolation ( 1 million years) from its sister, E. newberryi, from which it is separated by a geographic break across the Los Angeles Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be reliably diagnosed on the basis of meristicse.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  exposed anterior supraorbital neuromasts on adults (Fig 4, neuromast row no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) and higher pectoral fin-ray counts in E. newberryias well as morphometric characters as identified by discriminant function analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing of mitochondrial control region or cytochrome b [10] or amplification of any of the suite of microsatellite markers [12] can also provide easy diagnosis, and simple PCR assays for species determination can be easily devised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphological distinctions suggest adaptations to a more benthic mode of life in E. kristinae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sexual dimorphism associated with an enlarged jaw in adult males is presumptively used in mating burrow construction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work to better establish ecological distinction, sexual dimorphism, and/or behavioral differences between the two species is merited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. kristinae is critically endangered as it appears to persist in only three sites based on the most recent surveys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, immediate action is needed to prevent extinction of the species during Californias current and persistent drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All management units of E. newberryi and E. kristinae should maintain state and federal endangered status until recovery has been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
