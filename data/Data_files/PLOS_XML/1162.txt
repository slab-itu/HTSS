The intron in centromeric noncoding RNA facilitates RNAi-mediated formation of heterochromatin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In fission yeast, the formation of centromeric heterochromatin is induced through the RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some pre-mRNA splicing mutants (prp) exhibit defective formation of centromeric heterochromatin, suggesting that splicing factors play roles in the formation of heterochromatin, or alternatively that the defect is caused by impaired splicing of pre-mRNAs encoding RNAi factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we demonstrate that the splicing factor spPrp16p is enriched at the centromere, and associates with Cid12p (a factor in the RNAi pathway) and the intron-containing dg ncRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, removal of the dg intron, mutations of its splice sites, or replacement of the dg intron with an euchromatic intron significantly decreased H3K9 dimethylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also revealed that splicing of dg ncRNA is repressed in cells and its repression depends on the distance from the transcription start site to the intron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inefficient splicing was also observed in other intron-containing centromeric ncRNAs, dh and antisense dg, and splicing of antisense dg ncRNA was repressed in the presence of the RNAi factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the introns retained in centromeric ncRNAs work as facilitators, co-operating with splicing factors assembled on the intron and serving as a platform for the recruitment of RNAi factors, in the formation of centromeric heterochromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Formation of centromeric heterochromatin is required for correct segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fission yeast, formation of heterochromatin at centromeres is performed through the RNA interference (RNAi) system, which involves processing of noncoding RNAs transcribed from the centromeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the intron in the centromeric dg ncRNAs facilitates formation of centromeric heterochromatin in fission yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that the splicing factor spPrp16p associates with the RNAi factor and intron-containing dg ncRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of or mutations in the dg intron significantly decreased H3K9 dimethylation, suggesting that the intron and associated splicing factors serve as a platform for recruitment of RNAi factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inefficient splicing is a hallmark of intron-containing centromeric ncRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such repression of splicing seems to be important for facilitation of heterochromatin formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introns in euchromatic regions are removed by splicing to generate functional RNAs, whereas centromeric introns are retained in ncRNAs by splicing repression and play roles in gene silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings shed light on the novel roles of introns in epigenetic regulation of gene expression and heterochromatin formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chromosome segregation is a fundamental process in the transmission of genetic information to the daughter cells in eukaryotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During mitosis, formation of heterochromatin at centromeres is essential for correct segregation of chromosomes, because centromeric heterochromatin provides an environment that promotes the assembly of the kinetochore, the protein complex that serves as an attachment site for microtubules [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The RNA interference (RNAi) machinery in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe was previously reported to be involved in the formation of centromeric heterochromatin [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are transcribed from centromeres, which consist of repetitive sequences named dg and dh, by RNA polymerase II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are synthesized from transcribed ncRNAs by RNA-directed RNA polymerase (Rdp1p), and are then processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by Dicer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNAs then associate with Ago1p to form the RNAi-induced Transcriptional Silencing (RITS) complex with Chp1p and Tas3p [2], and function as guide molecules that direct the RITS complex to nascent ncRNAs through base pairing interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RITS complex recruits the CLRC complex, which contains the methyltransferase Clr4p, to the pericentromere region, where it promotes the dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dimethylation of H3K9 creates a binding site for Swi6p, a heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) homologue, to form heterochromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent studies reported that mutations in specific splicing factors, such as Cwf10p (Complexed with Cdc5) and Prp10p (pre-mRNA processing 10), and spliceosomal U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) decreased the generation of siRNAs from centromeric ncRNAs, resulting in the defective formation of heterochromatin at centromeres [5, 6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the splicing machinery is involved in RNAi-mediated heterochromatic gene silencing at centromeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding the role of the splicing machinery in RNAi-directed heterochromatin formation, we found an mRNA-type intron in centromeric dg ncRNA and proposed a model in which the spliceosome (or sub-spliceosome consisting of a part of the splicing factors) that assembles on the intron in centromeric ncRNA serves as a platform for the binding of RNAi factors to centromeric ncRNAs, thereby promoting RNAi-mediated formation of centromeric heterochromatin [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, it was recently reported that proper splicing of pre-mRNAs encoding RNAi factors is necessary for heterochromatin formation at the pericentromere region, suggesting that defective formation of centromeric heterochromatin in prp splicing mutants is a secondary effect of defective splicing of pre-mRNAs encoding RNAi factors [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we showed that the splicing factor encoded by the prp16+ gene is enriched at the centromeres and interacts with Cid12p, a component of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RDRC), in S. pombe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also showed that the intron in dg centromeric ncRNA plays an important role in promoting the RNAi-mediated formation of centromeric heterochromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that the splicing machinery and intron in centromeric ncRNA play intrinsic roles in the formation of centromeric heterochromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
prp14_exhibits_defects_in_formation_of_centromeric_heterochromatin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
prp14 was isolated as a pre-mRNA splicing mutant that accumulates pre-mRNAs at non-permissive temperatures in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It exhibits cold sensitivity (22°C) and temperature sensitivity (37°C) for growth, and grows slowly at the permissive temperature of 33°C [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complementation cloning of the prp14+ gene revealed that the mutation in prp14 resides in SPBC1711.17, which encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human Prp16p (See S1 Text and S1 Fig), indicating that the prp14 mutation is a prp16 allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hereafter, we refer to prp14 and its wild-type product as prp16 and spPrp16p, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some splicing mutants are defective in the RNAi-mediated formation of centromeric heterochromatin in S. pombe [5, 6], and we proposed a model in which the spliceosome or sub-spliceosome forms a platform for the recruitment of RNAi factors to ncRNAs transcribed from the centromere [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that prp16-2 was hypersensitive to the microtubule-destabilizing drug thiabendazole (TBZ) (Fig 1A) and accumulated unprocessed dg ncRNA transcribed from centromeres [6], suggesting that prp16 has defects in the attachment of microtubules to kinetochores and formation of centromeric heterochromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further characterized prp16 in terms of the relationship between the splicing machinery and centromeric gene silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1B, the prp16-2 mutant exhibited a high incidence of lagging chromosomes during mitosis, consistent with defective attachment of microtubules to kinetochores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the integrity of pericentromeric heterochromatin, which is required for the proper assembly of kinetochores, we constructed prp16-2 with the ura4+ marker gene in the otr1 region of centromere 1 (S2 Fig), and then serially spotted the resultant cells onto plates with or without 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2A, prp16-2 cells harboring the inserted ura4+ gene were highly sensitive to 5-FOA, similar to the swi6 heterochromatin protein mutant, suggesting that, in these mutants, the ura4+ gene was expressed when inserted in centromeric regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, a wild-type strain harboring the ura4+ gene inserted into the otr1 region grew well on 5-FOA plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-PCR analysis also revealed that the ura4+ gene inserted into the otr1 region was expressed as in a swi6 mutant harboring the same insertion (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further demonstrate the impaired formation of centromeric heterochromatin in prp16, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis using an anti-H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2C, the prp16 mutation decreased the H3K9me2 level in the pericentromeric region to a level observed in dcr1, indicating defective formation of pericentromeric heterochromatin in prp16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, northern blot analysis revealed that the amount of centromeric siRNAs derived from dg ncRNA was markedly reduced in prp16-2 (Fig 2D, lane 5), consistent with our previous report showing that prp16 accumulates unprocessed dg ncRNA [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that processing of centromeric ncRNAs is defective in prp16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, expression of the wild-type prp16+ gene rescued defective production of centromeric siRNAs, indicating that the prp16+ gene is responsible for formation of centromeric heterochromatin (Fig 2D, lane 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

spPrp16p_is_enriched_at_the_centromere_in_S_pombe  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because prp16 was isolated in the screen for defective pre-mRNA splicing at the non-permissive temperature, the impaired formation of centromeric heterochromatin may have been caused by defects in splicing of pre-mRNAs encoding factors involved in RNAi-mediated formation of centromeric heterochromatin, as suggested by Kallgren et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A RT-PCR analysis of splicing defects revealed that the prp16-2 mutation impaired splicing of ago1+, sir2+, hrr1+, arb2+, ers1+, and dsh1+ pre-mRNAs at the temperatures at which analyses on heterochromatin formation were conducted (S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that the observed defects in the formation of centromeric heterochromatin in prp16 are potentially due to splicing defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, prp13-1, which has defects in the formation of pericentromeric heterochromatin [6], similar to prp16, did not exhibit defects in pre-mRNA splicing for the RNAi factors analyzed, although very weak splicing defects were observed for Ago1p and Arb2p (S3 Fig, lanes prp13-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In prp13-1, mature mRNAs encoding the RNAi factors were produced at levels almost equal to those in wild-type cells at all temperatures tested, suggesting that the defects observed in centromeric gene silencing in the prp mutants cannot be simply attributed to secondary effects of splicing defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, spPrp16-GFP was detected in the nucleus as a dot-like signal with a diffuse nuclear distribution when it was over-expressed from a multicopy plasmid pSP1 (Fig 3A), but not when it was expressed from the endogenous locus (S4A Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because prp16 exhibited a defect in formation of centromeric heterochromatin, we speculated that the nuclear site of the dot-like signal of overexpressed spPrp16-GFP corresponded to centromeres or kinetochores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this idea, we co-expressed spPrp16-GFP and Nuf2-RFP, a kinetochore protein tagged with RFP, and observed their localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dot-like signal of over-expressed spPrp16-GFP was colocalized with the Nuf2-RFP signal, suggesting that spPrp16p was enriched at the centromere (or kinetochore) when over-expressed (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ChIP analysis using a strain expressing FLAG-tagged spPrp16p from the endogenous locus revealed that spPrp16p was enriched at the dg and dh repeats in the pericentromere region (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that spPrp16p plays some roles at the centromeres, in addition to its function as an RNA helicase in the splicing reaction [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

spPrp16p_interacts_with_Cid12p__a_component_of_RDRC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the role of spPrp16p in the formation of centromeric heterochromatin, we examined the physical interactions between spPrp16p and components of the RNAi pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay using a strain expressing spPrp16p-HA and Cid12p-TAP or Chp1p-FLAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cid12p is a poly(A) polymerase family member protein that is a component of the RDRC, which binds centromeric ncRNAs to initiate dsRNA synthesis, and Chp1p is a component of the RITS complex that contains Ago1p [4, 10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we were unable to detect an interaction between spPrp16p-HA and Chp1p-FLAG under the conditions tested (S4B Fig), we did detect spPrp16p-HA in the precipitate of Cid12-TAP, suggesting that spPrp16p interacts with Cid12p (Fig 3D, lanes RNase A-).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the interaction between spPrp16p and Cid12p is RNA-dependent, we treated samples with RNase A and tested the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of samples with RNase A completely degraded dg RNAs (S4C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3D (lanes marked as RNase A +), RNase treatment did not affect co-immunoprecipitation of Cid12p with spPrp16p, indicating that the association of spPrp16p with Cid12p is not mediated through RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_intron_in_dg_ncRNA_facilitates_the_formation_of_heterochromatin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The physical association of spPrp16p with Cid12p supports the model proposed in our previous study, in which the spliceosome or sub-spliceosome assembled on the intron serves as a platform for recruiting RNAi factors [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the platform model further, we next investigated whether removal of the intron in dg ncRNA affects heterochromatin formation at the centromere using a minichromosome with or without the dg intron (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This minichromosome contains a central core sequence (cc2) and the part of the dg region necessary for centromere functions [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ChIP analyses of H3K9me2 and Swi6p heterochromatin protein using minichromosome-specific primers revealed that H3K9me2 and Swi6p levels on the dg region in the intron-less minichromosome (Less) were clearly lower than those in the intron-containing minichromosome (Full) (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a strain harboring deletions of the dcr1+, clr4+, or rdp1+ genes, which are essential for the RNAi pathway, the level of H3K9me2 in the minichromosome was markedly reduced, demonstrating that dimethylation of H3K9 on the minichromosome is also mediated by the RNAi-mediated pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the dg intron facilitates the formation of heterochromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also tested the association of spPrp16p with dg ncRNA with or without the intron (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) analysis using minichromosome-specific primers revealed that the amount of intron-less dg ncRNA bound to spPrp16p-Myc was lower than that of intron-containing dg ncRNA (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products from the precipitates indicated that spPrp16p bound both unspliced and spliced dg ncRNAs (S5 Fig, WT/anti-Myc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of steady-state intron-containing dg ncRNAs was lower than that of intron-less dg ncRNA (Fig 5B, lanes WT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no difference in the amount of intron-less dg ncRNA between the WT and dcr1, whereas the amount of intron-containing dg ncRNA was significantly elevated in dcr1 (Fig 5B, lanes dcr1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the amounts of both transcripts were the same, these results imply that dg transcripts from the intron-containing minichromosome were more efficiently processed into siRNAs than those from the intron-less minichromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the decreased binding of spPrp16p to dg ncRNA was observed in dcr1 (Fig 5A), suggesting that the interaction between spPrp16p and dg ncRNA was dependent on a functional RNAi system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies reported that the formation of centromeric heterochromatin is important for preventing the missegregation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis [12, 13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the role of the dg intron in the formation of centromeric heterochromatin, we performed mitotic stability assays on minichromosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we measured the frequency of mitotic losses in the minichromosome with or without the dg intron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the minichromosome used in these experiments contained the leu1 selection marker, mitotic loss of the minichromosome could be analyzed by growing minichromosome-containing cells on plates with or without leucine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results obtained indicated that the frequency of missegregation of the intron-less minichromosome (Less) was higher than that of the intron-containing minichromosome (Full) in wild-type cells (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed the same phenomenon in dcr1 cells, suggesting that the effect of the dg intron on chromosome segregation is at least partially RNAi-independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results led us to conclude that the intron in dg ncRNA facilitates formation of centromeric heterochromatin in S. pombe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_a_chimeric_RNA_containing_the_intron_of_the_euchromatic_gene  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the role of the dg intron in facilitating H3K9 dimethylation, we replaced the dg intron in the dg ncRNA gene (SPNCRNA.232) cloned in pREP1 (the 5-long construct) with the intron from the gcd10 gene, which encodes a tRNA methyltransferase (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected the gcd10 intron because the intron length (136 bp) is similar to that of the dg intron (138 bp).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in S6 Fig, the chimeric transcript from the fusion construct, 5-long (g10in), was spliced with low efficiency, although the gcd10 intron itself is spliced efficiently in the original gcd10 pre-mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP analysis using plasmid-specific primers revealed that a H3K9me2 level on the 5-long construct was significantly reduced in dcr1, clr4, and prp16-2, suggesting that enhanced methylation of H3K9 on the plasmid construct is RNAi- and spPrp16p-dependent, like the minichromosome constructs (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the 5-long (g10in) construct also exhibited a reduced level of H3K9me2 relative to that of the 5-long construct [Fig 6B, WT/5-long and WT/5-long (g10in)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, histone H3 on the 5-long (g10in) construct was almost the same as that on the 5-long construct (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the sequence of the dg intron itself is important for H3K9 dimethylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the sequence element involved in the facilitated H3K9 dimethylation, we replaced a part of the dg intron in the 5-long construct with the sequence of the gcd10 intron, as shown in S7A Fig, and performed ChIP analysis using the plasmid-specific primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replacement of the 5 side sequence (46 bp) of the dg intron with that of the gcd10 intron decreased the level of H3K9me2, suggesting that an element responsible for facilitating H3K9 dimethylation is present in the 5 region of the intron (S7B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mutations_at_splice_sites_affect_the_efficiency_of_H3K9_methylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether recognition of splice sites in the dg intron is required to facilitate heterochromatin formation, we constructed plasmids containing the dg intron with mutated splice sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 7A, we mutated the 5 splice site (5SS), branch and 3 splice sites (BP+3SS), or all of them (5SS+BP+3SS) in the dg intron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these mutations completely inhibited splicing of the dg transcripts (S8A Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ChIP analysis revealed that the level of H3K9me2 at the dg region was significantly reduced in plasmids containing mutations at the splice and branch sites, in comparison with plasmid containing the wild-type dg intron (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, RIP analysis using a strain expressing Myc-tagged spPrp16p revealed that association of spPrp16p with the dg ncRNA was significantly decreased by the mutations at the 5SS, BP+3SS and 5SS+BP+3SS (S8B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the splice and branch site sequences recognizable by splicing factors are necessary for the facilitation of H3K9 dimethylation, in addition to the 5 cis-element in the dg intron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

An_upstream_region_is_involved_in_the_splicing_repression_of_dg_ncRNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In S. pombe, more than 43% of genes contain introns [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to the dg intron, the introns in these euchromatic genes do not induce the formation of heterochromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What is the difference between the intron in the dg ncRNA gene and those in euchromatic genes?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, we noted that the splicing efficiency of dg ncRNA is very low (S5 Fig, lane: Input; S6 Fig, lane: 5-long; [6]), despite the fact that the splice and branch site sequences in the dg intron closely match the corresponding consensus sequences in S. pombe [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This low splicing efficiency appears to be a unique feature of the dg intron, as most introns in the euchromatic regions are efficiently spliced after transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that truncated dg ncRNA transcribed from a plasmid with short upstream and short downstream sequences driven by the nmt1 promoter was efficiently spliced, similar to euchromatic introns (S9A and S9B Fig, dg-short).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This efficient splicing was not due to the nmt1 promoter, because original-size dg ncRNA transcribed under the control of the nmt1 promoter exhibited very low splicing efficiency, similar to endogenous dg ncRNA (S9A and S9B Fig, dg long).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmid producing efficiently spliced dg ncRNA exhibited a markedly reduced level of H3K9me2 in the ChIP analysis (S9C Fig, Short) relative to the plasmid possessing the long construct with low splicing efficiency (S9C Fig, Long), suggesting that retention of the dg intron by splicing repression facilitates dimethylation of H3K9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because a 5-long construct with the long upstream sequence (-570 bp from the dg intron) and shortened downstream sequence (+106 bp from the dg intron) exhibited low splicing efficiency, similar to the wild-type dg construct (dg-long), we speculated that the upstream region contains the cis-element needed for splicing repression to retain the intron element facilitating H3K9me2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because splicing repression of the 5-long construct was not relieved in dcr1 and clr4, inhibition of dg RNA splicing is not dependent on the RNAi system (S10 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the cis-elements responsible for splicing repression, we constructed a series of plasmids expressing dg transcripts with serially deleted upstream regions (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transformants with these plasmids were then subjected to RT-PCR, qRT-PCR and ChIP analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, we found that deletion of the upstream region gradually increased splicing efficiency (Fig 8B) and decreased the H3K9me2 levels (Fig 8C), implying a tendency toward an inverse relationship between the splicing efficiency of the dg intron and H3K9 modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also constructed a deletion series using the 5-long (g10in) construct with the gcd10 intron and examined their splicing efficiencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in S11 Fig, deletions of the upstream region promoted splicing efficiency of the gcd10 chimeric constructs, although splicing enhancements in dg-4 and short chimeric transcripts were weak for unknown reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that splicing repression is independent of intron sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The gradual increase of splicing efficiency in the 5-long deletion constructs suggests that the upstream region contains no specific cis-elements involved in repression, and that the distances between the transcription start sites and the intron are important for the splicing repression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this possibility, we ligated a 442 bp DNA fragment of the actin gene (+4 to +445) upstream of dg-short to yield the Act1/dg construct, which has almost the same upstream length as 5-long but with a different sequence (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-PCR analysis revealed that the splicing efficiency of Act1/dg transcripts was very low, like the 5-long transcripts (Fig 8D), indicating that distance from the transcription start site to the dg intron is important for splicing repression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ChIP analysis revealed that the level of H3K9 dimethylation on the Act1/dg construct was low (Fig 8D), suggesting that elements involved in promoting formation of H3K9me2 are present not only in the dg intron but also in the 5' upstream region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intron-containing_centromeric_ncRNAs_are_inefficiently_spliced  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, Lee et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  showed that cryptic introns specify heterochromatin domains (HOODs) in the S. pombe genome [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, they reported the presence of the cryptic introns in the dh transcript and dg antisense transcript [16] (Fig 9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined splicing of these intron-containing centromeric transcripts by RT-PCR and found that their splicing efficiencies were also low, like the dg intron, in wild-type cells (Fig 9B, WT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in a strain harboring deletion of the cid12+, dcr1+, or clr4+ genes, which are essential for the RNAi machinery, splicing of the antisense dg intron was significantly upregulated (Fig 9B, cid12, dcr1, and clr4), suggesting that its splicing is also repressed in wild-type cells, like the dg intron, and that the RNAi system is involved in that splicing repression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of Dcr1p and Cid12p, by contrast, did not affect splicing of centromeric ncRNAs in wild-type cells (S12 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In this study, we cloned the S. pombe gene responsible for the prp14 mutation, which impairs RNAi-mediated formation of centromeric heterochromatin (Figs 1 and 2), as well as pre-mRNA splicing [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the prp14+ gene encodes a homologue of the S. cerevisiae and human splicing factor Prp16p, a DEAH-box RNA helicase with ATPase activity [17] (S1C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, renamed prp14 as prp16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although prp16 exhibited defective splicing of pre-mRNAs encoding several factors involved in RNAi-mediated gene silencing (S3 Fig), the observation that spPrp16p (encoded by the prp16+ gene) is enriched at the centromere and interacts with Cid12p, a component of the RDRC of the RNAi system, suggested that spPrp16p plays a direct role in the formation of centromeric heterochromatin (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, defective formation of centromeric heterochromatin in prp16 might be caused by composite effects of the splicing impairments and the functional abnormality of spPrp16p in heterochromatin formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously reported that another temperature-sensitive splicing mutant, prp13-1, in which the affected gene encodes the U4 snRNA essential for pre-mRNA splicing [18], is defective in centromeric gene silencing [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of prp13, splicing impairments for RNAi factors were not observed at the temperature (26°C) that induced defective formation of centromeric heterochromatin (S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the phenotype defective in the formation of centromeric heterochromatin in prp13-1 does not appear to be a secondary effect of splicing defects, although we cannot exclude the possibility that pre-mRNA splicing of unknown factors involved in gene silencing is defective in prp13-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several studies have reported crosstalk between splicing factors and RNAi- or exosome-mediated gene silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first such evidence came from pull-down experiments using TAP-tagged Cid12p, which showed that several spliceosomal proteins co-precipitated with Cid12p-TAP in rdp1 [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bayne et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [5] revealed that csp4 (centromere: suppressor of position effect 4) and csp5, which alleviated the silencing of marker genes inserted into the otr region in the centromere, encode the splicing factors Cwf10p and Prp39p, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also demonstrated that Cwf10p associates with Cid12p and centromeric chromatin, suggesting that splicing factors facilitate RNAi-directed silencing [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another splicing factor, Spf30p, was also shown to assist exosome-mediated centromeric gene silencing [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, spliceosomes stalled on intron-containing pre-mRNAs serve as a signal that induces siRNA synthesis by the SCANR (Spliceosome-Coupled And Nuclear RNAi) complex [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains unclear why these splicing factors associate closely with RNAi- or exosome-mediated gene silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous study on prp13-1, we identified an intron typical for those in pre-mRNAs in centromeric dg ncRNA, and proposed a model in which the spliceosome or sub-spliceosome assembled on the intron functions as a platform for recruiting RDRC to facilitate the processing of centromeric ncRNAs [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we tested this platform model by removing the intron from the dg transcript and mutating the splice sites of the dg intron, leading to reduced binding of spPrp16p to dg ncRNA (Fig 5A and S8B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that the removal of and mutations in the intron significantly decreased levels of H3K9me2 and Swi6p binding (Figs 4B and 7B), indicating that the intron is actually necessary for facilitating RNAi-mediated formation of heterochromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lee et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  recently suggested that the splicing machinery and its associated factor Nrl1p (NRDE-2 like 1) act on introns to specify domains for heterochromatin (HOODs) in S. pombe [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They discovered widespread previously unannotated cryptic introns in genes for mRNAs and ncRNAs, including the dh ncRNA gene in the pericentromere [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dh ncRNAs, as well as dg ncRNAs, are processed to siRNAs essential for RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They proposed that RNAi targets include cryptic introns, which play an important role in defining the targets of RNAi/exosome-mediated heterochromatin assembly through the spliceosome [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results and the aforementioned findings support the idea that centromeric introns serve as signals for heterochromatin formation, in collaboration with the splicing machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that splicing of the dg ncRNA was affected by the distance from the transcription start site to the intron (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chimeric 5-long (g10in) and Act1/dg constructs also exhibited low splicing efficiencies, supporting the idea that splicing repression of the dg intron depends on the length, rather than the nucleotide sequence, of the upstream sequence (S6 and S11 Figs and Fig 8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several lines of experiments in yeast and mammals demonstrated that a cap-binding complex (CBC) promotes binding of U1 snRNP to cap-proximal 5' splice sites and stimulates splicing; consequently, introns positioned closely to transcription start sites are spliced more efficiently [21, 22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, in single-intron genes in yeasts, most introns are found at the 5' ends [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the downstream positioning of the dg intron may keep splicing efficiency low so that the intron is retained within the transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
qRT-PCR and ChIP analyses of the 5 deletion constructs showed that splicing efficiency of the dg intron and H3K9me2 levels tended to have an inverse relationship (Fig 8B and 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of the upstream region increased splicing efficiency gradually; however, the H3K9me2 levels decreased abruptly after deletion of 73 bp from the 5long construct, suggesting that there exists a threshold splicing efficiency for the enhancement of heterochromatin formation or that a cis-element facilitating heterochromatin formation, which functions in combination with the dg intron, is present in the 5 upstream region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the cryptic introns also had very low splicing efficiencies (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that depletion of a factor essential for the RNAi machinery, such as Cid12p, Dcr1p, or Clr4p, facilitated splicing of the antisense dg transcript (Fig 9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggested that the active RNAi machinery is closely involved in splicing repression for the antisense dg intron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the antisense dg intron is localized within the hairpin-like, highly structured region called RevCen (Fig 10A) [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small centromeric RNAs derived from the RevCen region were found in rdp1 cells, suggesting that hairpin-like RevCen transcripts are processed into siRNAs by Dcr1p, independently of RDRC activity [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These siRNAs have been proposed to function in initiation of heterochromatin formation [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that removal of the antisense dg intron from RevCen transcripts by splicing disrupts the hairpin-like structure necessary for RDRC-independent processing, resulting in reduced formation of heterochromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(A) Predicted hairpin-like structures of RevCen [24] containing the antisense dg intron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary structure of RevCen predicted by Mfold [25] was assessed experimentally [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intron regions are indicated in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Efficient recruitment of RNAi components onto centromeric ncRNA is achieved through their interaction with the spliceosome (or sub-spliceosome) assembled on the intron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repression of the splicing reaction is induced by the long upstream region (i) or induced by the active RNAi machinery, resulting in formation of a hairpin-like structure in the intron region, which might be processed into siRNAs RDRC-independently as proposed in [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the stalled splicing complex may promote the association of RNAi components with ncRNAs, facilitating heterochromatin formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006606.g010  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, regions containing the dg and dh introns were also predicted by Mfold, which predicts RNA folding by minimizing free energy [25], to form highly structured hairpins (S13 and S14 Figs), although the predicted secondary structures should be confirmed experimentally, as was done previously for RevCen structure using enzymatic and chemical probing [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centromeric introns retained in the transcripts by splicing repression may function not only in the splicing machinery-dependent facilitation of heterochromatin formation via assembly of the platform complex, but also in RDRC-independent initiation of heterochromatin assembly through formation of hairpin-like RNAs that are processed directly by Dcr1p as proposed for RevCen [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Splicing repression may result in formation of a stalled spliceosome, triggering association and recruitment of RNAi factors to centromeric ncRNAs and promoting the formation of heterochromatin (Fig 10B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the 5-long (g10in) and Act1/dg transcripts did not induce facilitated H3K9 dimethylation, the cis-elements in the dg intron and 5' upstream region seem to be required for upregulation of H3K9 dimethylation, in addition to repression of splicing (S7 Fig and Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analyses of the cis-elements and the mechanisms that connect splicing repression to formation of heterochromatin are now underway in our laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, the human homologue of spPrp16p, DHX38, is a component of the Interphase Centromere Complex (ICEN) [26], suggesting that the human homologue of spPrp16p also plays an important role at the centromere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently found that satellite I ncRNAs transcribed from human centromeres associate with Aurora B kinase, a major regulator of chromosome segregation, and that knockdown of centromeric satellite I ncRNAs induces the defective attachment of microtubules to kinetochores, leading to impaired segregation of chromosomes in HeLa cells [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Association of DHX38 with satellite I ncRNAs is now under investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of spPrp16p, together with its human homologue DHX38, and introns in centromeric ncRNAs will shed light on evolutionarily conserved crosstalk between the splicing machinery and the mechanisms that maintain centromere functions through ncRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

A multicopy plasmid (pSP1) harboring the dcr1+ or cid12+ gene was introduced into wild-type cells, and splicing of dg, antisense dg and dh ncRNAs was analyzed by RT-PCR (panels of dg intron, antisense dg intron and dh intron).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of the dcr1+ and cid12+ genes was confirmed by RT-PCR (panels of dcr1 mRNA and cid12 mRNA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Act1 mRNA was analyzed as a loading control (act1 mRNA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT- indicates a reaction without reverse transcriptase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

S13_Fig_Predicted_structure_of_the_dg_intron_region  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Secondary structure of the dg intron with upstream (-100 bp from the dg intron) and downstream (+100 bp from the dg intron) sequences was predicted using Mfold (http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations introduced in the splice sites or branch point shown in Fig 7 did not affect the predicted structure significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this region is included in the dg-short construct, deletions of the upstream sequence shown in Fig 8A also do not affect the structural prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intron region is indicated in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
