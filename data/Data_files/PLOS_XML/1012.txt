Zika Virus Infection as a Cause of Congenital Brain Abnormalities and GuillainBarré Syndrome: Systematic Review  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Background  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated in March 2016 that there was scientific consensus that the mosquito-borne Zika virus was a cause of the neurological disorder GuillainBarré syndrome (GBS) and of microcephaly and other congenital brain abnormalities based on rapid evidence assessments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decisions about causality require systematic assessment to guide public health actions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The objectives of this study were to update and reassess the evidence for causality through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection and (a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and (b) GBS in any population, and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods_and_Findings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study had three linked components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in February 2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes in ten dimensions: temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association, alternative explanations, cessation, doseresponse relationship, animal experiments, analogy, specificity, and consistency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we did a systematic review (protocol number CRD42016036693).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We searched multiple online sources up to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, WHO convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts who assessed the review findings and reached consensus statements to update the WHO position on causality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found 1,091 unique items up to May 30, 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of ten causality dimensions (all except doseresponse relationship and specificity), we found that more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika virus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For GBS, we included 36 items, of which more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all except doseresponse relationship, specificity, and animal experimental evidence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Articles identified nonsystematically from May 30 to July 29, 2016 strengthened the review findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expert panel concluded that (a) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including microcephaly, and (b) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and GBS is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of GBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expert panel recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or GBS but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to recommend increased public health measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weaknesses are the limited assessment of the role of dengue virus and other possible cofactors, the small number of comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up to date with the pace of publication of new research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This systematic review found sufficient evidence to say that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of GBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An explosive pandemic of Zika virus infection [1] in 2015 caught the world by surprise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and World Health Organization (WHO) published an alert about a possible association with increases in reports of congenital abnormalities and GuillainBarré syndrome (GBS) on December 1, 2015 [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On February 1, 2016, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microcephaly at birth is a clinical finding that can include a range of brain malformations resulting from a failure of neurogenesis [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infections acquired in pregnancy, including cytomegalovirus and rubella, are established causes [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GBS is an immune-mediated ascending flaccid paralysis, which typically occurs within a month of an infection, such as Campylobacter jejuni or cytomegalovirus [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As of October 20, 2016, 67 countries have reported autochthonous transmission of the mosquito-borne flavivirus Zika since 2015, and 27 of these countries have reported cases of congenital brain abnormalities, GBS, or both [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emergency committee recommended increased research [3] to provide more rigorous scientific evidence of a causal relationship as a basis for the global health response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unexplained clusters of rare but serious conditions require urgent assessment of causality, balancing speed with systematic appraisal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bradford Hill is widely credited for his proposed framework for thinking about causality in epidemiology, which listed nine viewpoints from which to study associations between exposure and disease (S1 Text, p2) [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since then, the list has been modified (S1 Text, p2; S1 Table) [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bradford Hill emphasised that his viewpoints were not rules but, taken together, the body of evidence should be used to decide whether there is any other more likely explanation than cause and effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The level of certainty required before judging that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and GBS is contentious [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most assessments have been based on rapid but nonsystematic appraisals [1012].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on rapid reviews, WHO has stated that there is scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and GBS since March 31, 2016 [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On April 13, a narrative review stated that there was a causal relationship between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence about the causal relationship between Zika virus and GBS has not yet been assessed in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously described a causality framework for Zika virus and plans for a systematic review (S1 Text, p3; S2 Table), with a preliminary overview of 21 studies, published up to March 4, 2016 [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The objectives of this study are to reassess the evidence for causality and update the WHO position about links between Zika virus and (a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and (b) GBS in any population, and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We describe three linked components: the causality framework, the systematic reviews, and the expert panel assessment of the review findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WHO Zika Causality Working Group convened the expert panel of 18 members with specialist knowledge in the fields of epidemiology and public health, virology, infectious diseases, obstetrics, neonatology, and neurology (membership of the expert panel is provided in the Acknowledgments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Zika_Causality_Framework  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In February 2016, we developed a causality framework for Zika virus by defining specific questions for each of ten dimensions, modified from Bradford Hills list (S2 Table): temporality; biological plausibility; strength of association; exclusion of alternative explanations; cessation; doseresponse relationship; animal experimental evidence; analogy; specificity; and consistency of findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This review covered 35 questions about congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, and 26 questions about GBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also listed seven groups of cofactors that might increase the risk of an outcome in the presence of Zika virus [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Systematic_Review  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our protocol was registered on March 21, 2016 in the database PROSPERO (CRD42016036693) [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report the methods in full according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [17] in S1 Text (p3-4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To report our findings, we use the term item for an individual record, e.g., a case report.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Occasionally, the same individuals or data were reported in more than one publication (item).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid double counting, we organised these items into groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose a primary publication (the item with the most complete information) to represent the group, to which other items were linked (S4 Table, S6 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Expert_Panel  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a series of web and telephone conferences between April 18 and May 23, 2016, we presented our approach to the assessment of causality, the causality framework, and our synthesis of evidence to the expert panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discussed these topics with the experts during the conferences and through email discussions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then drafted summary conclusions about the most likely explanation for the reported clusters of cases of microcephaly and GBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expert panel members reached consensus statements to update the WHO position (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found 1,091 unique items published from 1952 to May 30, 2016 (S1 Fig, S3 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most excluded items were reviews or editorials and commentaries (44%, n = 479).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included 106 items from 87 groups (Table 1), of which 83% were published in 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both outcomes, the majority of items were clinical, individual-level case reports, case series, or population-level surveillance data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

WHO_Expert_Panel_Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the evidence identified up to July 29, 2016, the expert panel concluded that  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The expert panel recognises that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or GBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The panel does not know whether these effects depend on as yet uncharacterised cofactors being present, nor does it know whether dengue virus plays a part, as this is carried by the same species of mosquito and has circulated in many countries during the same period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Up to May 30, 2016, we found evidence that supported a causal association between Zika virus infection and congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, with at least one study addressing one or more specific questions for eight of ten causality dimensions and between Zika virus infection and GBS, with at least one study about one or more specific questions in seven of ten dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are methodological weaknesses, inconsistencies, and gaps in the body of evidence for both sets of conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies found after the cut-off for our first searches did not change our conclusions but strengthened the evidence about biological plausibility, strength of association, and exclusion of alternative explanations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interpretation_of_the_Review_Findings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The expert panels conclusions support causal links between Zika virus and congenital brain abnormalities and GBS and address Bradford Hills question, is there any other answer equally, or more, likely than cause and effect?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conclusions consider both the epidemiological context of unexpected clusters of different types of neurological conditions in countries that have experienced their first outbreaks of Zika virus infection and the strengths and weaknesses of a systematically reviewed body of evidence about ten dimensions of causality (S4 Table, S5 Table, S6 Table and S7 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Empirical observations cannot prove causality, however [7, 142], and discussions have been intense [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cause can be identified without understanding all the necessary component causes or the complete causal mechanisms involved [142, 143].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of GBS, the infections that precede it are often referred to as triggers of the immune-mediated causal pathways involved in pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The body of evidence about Zika virus and congenital abnormalities (72 items included) has grown more quickly than that for GBS (36 items).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research efforts might have concentrated on congenital abnormalities because clusters of affected infants were so unusual, especially in Brazil, where rubella has been eradicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, GBS is an established postinfectious neurological disorder, and some commentators have already assumed Zika virus as another cause [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst only one case-control study from French Polynesia has been published so far [112], clusters of GBS during outbreaks of Zika virus infection have been reported from several other countries [144], and case-control studies are ongoing in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparative studies from French Polynesia suggest that the risk of both microcephaly or of GBS is at least 30 times higher in people who had Zika virus infection compared to those who did not [47, 94, 112], although confidence intervals are wide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The true effect size might be weaker because the earliest studies investigating causality are often overestimates [145].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even if the methods of forthcoming studies in Brazil [42] and elsewhere reduce confounding and bias, the increase in the risk of disease amongst those with Zika virus infection is likely to remain substantially raised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inconsistencies in the evidence still need investigation, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disease clusters were not seen in Africa [146], but congenital abnormalities and GBS are rare complications that might not be detected in countries with small populations or poor surveillance systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of microcephaly, terminations of potentially affected pregnancies might have resulted in underascertainment [147].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Current evidence does not show which specific environmental and host factors interact with Zika virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cofactor that increases the risk of neurological damage could help to explain why surveillance reports show clusters of microcephaly or GBS in some geographical areas but not others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dengue virus has been suggested as a possible cofactor or another component cause [143].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One major limitation to interpretation of data about causality and cofactors is the lack of accurate and accessible diagnostic tools, owing to the short duration of viraemia, cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses, and lack of standardisation [148].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Strengths_and_Limitations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The strengths of our study are that we appraised evidence of causality systematically but rapidly and transparently within a structured framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We searched both published and unpublished sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The systematic review process could not eliminate publication bias but reduced the risk that only positive reports in favour of causation would be evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were limitations to the process, too.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our search strategy did not cover the literature about analogous conditions or cofactors systematically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not select studies or extract data in duplicate, but additional reviewers checked the extracted data independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The included studies used a variety of case definitions for microcephaly and GBS, and we could not standardise these, so misclassification is possible, but this limitation did not change the overall conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our rapid assessment of quality was not quantitative; we did not find a tool that covered all review questions and study designs appropriately and were not able to standardise the GRADE tool across study designs in the time available [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implications_for_Policy_and_Research  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The conclusions of the expert panel facilitate the promotion of stronger public health measures and research to tackle Zika virus and its effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evidence gaps that we identified provide researchers with research questions, and WHO has published a Zika virus research agenda [149].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Better diagnostic tests will allow more accurate assessment of Zika virus in tissues and of population-level immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research about Zika virus and acute flaccid paralysis is needed to define the clinical and electrophysiological pattern, mechanisms of causality, and to distinguish between the roles of autoimmunity and direct effects on anterior horn cells or neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basic research will also further the development of vaccines, treatments, and vector control methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the populations currently at risk, cohort studies are needed to determine both absolute and relative risks of pregnancies affected by asymptomatic and symptomatic Zika virus infection and the role of cofactors and effect modifiers, and to define the full range of physical and developmental abnormalities that comprise the congenital Zika virus syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

From_Rapid_Systematic_Review_to_Living_Systematic_Review  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our systematic review deals with multiple neurological disorders and more detailed questions about causality than other reviews.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reached the same conclusion as Rasmussen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [11], but the larger number of studies allowed a more comprehensive and balanced summary of evidence and of evidence gaps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our review addresses the association between Zika virus and GBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also plan to examine other acute neurological disorders (S1 Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our review will quickly become outdated because the pace of new publications is outstripping the time taken for the review process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concept of a living systematic review has been proposed as a way to combine rigour with timeliness for intervention research [150] through the development of methods to incorporate new evidence as soon as it is available and make evidence summaries available immediately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are working on methods to produce a living systematic review of the Zika causality framework that will incorporate new studies, provide frequent open access updates, and allow cumulative meta-analyses of both aggregate and individual patient data from rigorous prospective studies as these become available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The declaration by journal editors to improve access to data during public health emergencies [151, 152] could be combined with the living systematic review approach to improve timeliness and open access to research about causality [153].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, rapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed, both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rapid systematic review found sufficient evidence to conclude that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of GBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
