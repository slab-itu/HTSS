Three-dimensional preservation of cellular and subcellular structures suggests 1.6 billion-year-old crown-group red algae  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ~1.6 Ga Tirohan Dolomite of the Lower Vindhyan in central India contains phosphatized stromatolitic microbialites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report from there uniquely well-preserved fossils interpreted as probable crown-group rhodophytes (red algae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The filamentous form Rafatazmia chitrakootensis n. gen, n. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  has uniserial rows of large cells and grows through diffusely distributed septation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each cell has a centrally suspended, conspicuous rhomboidal disk interpreted as a pyrenoid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The septa between the cells have central structures that may represent pit connections and pit plugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another filamentous form, Denaricion mendax n. gen., n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sp., has coin-like cells reminiscent of those in large sulfur-oxidizing bacteria but much more recalcitrant than the liquid-vacuole-filled cells of the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are also resemblances with oscillatoriacean cyanobacteria, although cell volumes in the latter are much smaller.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wider affinities of Denaricion are uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ramathallus lobatus n. gen., n. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is a lobate sessile alga with pseudoparenchymatous thallus, cell fountains, and apical growth, suggesting florideophycean affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these inferences are correct, Rafatazmia and Ramathallus represent crown-group multicellular rhodophytes, antedating the oldest previously accepted red alga in the fossil record by about 400 million years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The last common ancestor of modern eukaryotes is generally believed to have lived during the Mesoproterozoic era, about 1.6 to 1 billion years ago, or possibly somewhat earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied exquisitely preserved fossil communities from ~1.6 billion-year-old sedimentary rocks in central India representing a shallow-water marine environment characterized by photosynthetic biomats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered amidst extensive cyanobacterial mats a biota of filamentous and lobate organisms that share significant features with modern eukaryotic algae, more specifically red algae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rocks mainly consist of calcium and magnesium carbonates, but the microbial mats and the fossils are preserved in calcium phosphate, letting us view the cellular and subcellular structures in three dimensions with the use of synchrotron-radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most conspicuous internal objects in the cells of the filamentous forms are rhomboidal platelets that we interpret to be part of the photosynthetic machinery of red algae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lobate forms grew as radiating globular or finger-like protrusions from a common centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fossils predate the previously earliest accepted red algae by about 400 million years, suggesting that eukaryotes may have a longer history than commonly assumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multicellular eukaryotes rose to prominence around the ProterozoicPhanerozoic transition coupled to evolving ecological interactions between megascopic autotrophs and heterotrophs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals in particular are thought to have had a pivotal role asfor examplepredators, grazers, and filterers in expanding the food web through interactive processes not available to microbial life [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fungi, the other major opisthokont multicellular clade, are important heterotrophic consumers, but their role in Phanerozoic ecosystem evolution is generally considered to be focused on the terrestrial biosphere [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three major lineages of multicellular eukaryotesPlantae, Fungi, and Metazoadiversified already during the Proterozoic, but the time of eukaryote origin is under dispute (reviews by [59]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates of the age of the last eukaryote common ancestor, LECA (the last ancestor of the eukaryote crown group), vary between extremes of about 0.8 Ga [10] and 2.3 Ga [11], though most proposed dates based on modern molecular-clock work land within the Mesoproterozoic [7,1216] or late Palaeoproterozoic [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The considerable interval of uncertainty is due to difficulties in establishing the origination time of fossil taxa used for calibration as well as to other problems involved in molecular-clock dating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One major issue is the lack of robust phylogenies in the base of the eukaryotic tree [6,1823].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The age of the first eukaryote common ancestor, FECA (the last ancestor of the eukaryote total group), is even more uncertain, an extreme proposal being early Archaean, based on evidence of methanogenesis at 3.5 Ga taken to herald the appearance of the euryarchaeotan sister group (containing methanogenic archaea) of the clade containing the Eukaryota [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of more widespread methanogenesis in the basal archaean tree [24], however, leaves this inference without support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more conservative minimum estimate suggests that FECA had arrived some time before 1.9 Ga based on the earliest widely acceptable eukaryote fossils [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is in the nature of stem-group organisms (see [25] for a discussion of the stem-group and crown-group concepts in palaeontology) that initially they do not differ phenetically from representatives of their sister group, and thus, attempts to identify FECA in the fossil record are a hopeless exercise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
More pertinent is the question of when stem-group eukaryotes had acquired fossilizable features that would enable us to recognize them in the fossil record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The path from FECA to LECA may have been a fast endosymbiosis-dominated set of events [10] or a slow process marked by successive events of horizontal gene transfer [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish between those two scenarios, it is necessary to identify eukaryote characters correctly in the deep fossil record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fossil morphological record of early eukaryotes is thus of crucial importance, but most reports of pre-Cryogenian eukaryotes have at some point been challenged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interpretation of morphologically simple fossils as early eukaryotes has mainly been based on large size, ornamentation of walls, and a complex, resistant wall ultrastructure [5,7,9,27,28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The iconic Palaeoproterozoic tubular fossil reported as Grypania (which lacks the segmented structure of the Mesoproterozoic type species and may not be a true Grypania [29]) is generally heralded as the first plausible eukaryote in the fossil record, mainly based on its size [7,3034], though the eukaryotic affinity has been questioned [29], with an alternative interpretation being its identification as a giant cyanobacterium [35,36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other early eukaryote-like fossils [3740] are plausible as such but unconfirmed as crown-group eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Geochemical evidence has also been summoned in support of early eukaryotes, but even more controversially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A much-cited report of 2.7 Ga sterane biomarkers attributed to eukaryotes [41,42] has been shown to be in error, the biomarkers having been introduced as younger contaminants [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of subsequent attempts to identify Archaean eukaryote biomarkers, all such evidence for eukaryote presence is now considered invalid, not only because of contamination issues [44] but also because the putative Archaean steranes that were taken as proxies for eukaryotic membrane sterols may also derive from noneukaryote life [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Establishing a minimum age for LECA implies identifying crown-group eukaryotes in the fossil record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bangiomorpha, interpreted as a bangiophycean rhodophyte [46], is dated to about 1.11.25 Ga [47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It represents the oldest generally accepted (though see [16,17,35,48]) fossil crown-group eukaryote.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier unicellular fossils interpreted as rhodophytes [49] have not found acceptance [50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simple acritarchs at 1.8 Ga [51] have been argued to indicate a presence of chlorophytes at that time [39], but the identification of the fossils as crown-group eukaryotes is controversial [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have studied uniquely preserved fossils from the ~1.6 Ga Tirohan Dolomite at Jankikund, Chitrakoot, central India, and present here cellularly and subcellularly preserved diverse forms that show characters of rhodophytes, implying that crown-group eukaryotes, and consequently LECA, are no younger than the Palaeoproterozoic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Geological_background  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Vindhyan Supergroup consists of a thick, unmetamorphosed sequence of sandstones, shales, and carbonate rocks, as well as volcanoclastic rocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ~1.6 Ga [52] Chitrakoot Formation, which includes the Tirohan Dolomite, belongs to the Lower Vindhyan (the Semri Group) and is exposed north of the Son River Valley in the Chitrakoot region, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, central India (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation rests unconformably on the Bundelkhand Granite and is unconformably overlain by the Kaimur Sandstone [53,54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phosphatized stromatolitic rocks of the Tirohan Dolomite at the Paisuni River section, Jankikund, are known for their exquisite preservation of microbial fossils [52,55,56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unit consists of stromatolitic carbonates with phosphorite occurring as bands within and capping the stromatolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intercolumnar matrix contains phosphatic intraclasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphatized fossils are found both in the intercolumnar matrix and in the phosphate bands in the stromatolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parts of the rock are silicified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tirohan Dolomite was deposited in a marine shallow-subtidal to supratidal environment [53,54,57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deposition in a photic and oxygenic environment is demonstrated by the dominance of gas-producing cyanobacteria [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results_and_discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tubular_forms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tubular components of the Tirohan stromatolitic biota mostly consist of aggregating masses of entangled filaments, interpreted to represent filamentous cyanobacteria [52,56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, scattered among the stromatolitic layers and the intercolumnar debris are isolated tubular structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these are less than 10 m in width and are probably sheaths of filamentous bacteria or chains of bacterial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some tubes, however, are considerably larger and represent potential eukaryotic organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Being rare, these have not been observed in petrographic sections but have been recovered by manual selection from acid residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The larger tubes vary in width from 58 to 275 m. Similar forms from the Tirohan phosphorites were initially reported and interpreted as Cambrian taxa, Cambrotubulus decurvatus and Hyolithellus vladimirovae [55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ensuing controversy about the age of the Lower Vindhyan and the provenance of the fossils was resolved by the demonstration that the Tirohan fossil tubes were morphologically analogous to modern filamentous algae rather than to the named Cambrian taxa and that PbPb isochron analysis confirmed a late Palaeoproterozoic rather than Cambrian age of the phosphorites [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the biological nature of these enigmatic fossils has not until now been seriously investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our microtomography data clarify the internal structure of the tubular fossils, suggesting that they represent two significantly different organisms, here named Rafatazmia chitrakootensis n. gen., n. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Denaricion mendax n. gen., n. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rafatazmia ranges in width from 58 to 175 m, Denaricion from 130 to 275 m. Rafatazmia consists of concatenated cell-like compartments, often collapsed or distorted, resulting in buckling and folding of the exterior, whereas Denaricion has a solid internal structure similar to a stack of coins, upholding the integrity of the outer shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lobate_thalli  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fabric of cyanobacteria-dominated biofilms in the stromatolitic columns contains embedded lobate thalli with cellular preservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differ significantly in size, structure, and preservation from the surrounding microbial communities and are analysed here as potential eukaryotes, Ramathallus lobatus n. gen., n. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Geological_age  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the remarkably old age that we cite for the rhodophyte-like fossils reported herein, it is necessary to discuss in some detail the reliability of the ~1.6 Ga date for the Tirohan Dolomite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vindhyan stratigraphy has generated a considerable amount of discussion and controversy over the years, and even in the recent literature, age estimates for the Semri Group (Lower Vindhyan) are given as either PalaeoMesoproterozoic, as indicated by geochronology [106,107], or EdiacaranCambrian, as suggested with reference to fossil content [108,109].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Correlation between the Chitrakoot Formation and the Semri sequence in the Son Valley is not straightforward [110], but regional isopach and lithofacies interpretations suggest that the Chitrakoot Formation belongs within the upper part of the Semri Group; in particular, correlation is suggested between the Tirohan Dolomite at Chitrakoot and the Rohtas Limestone (Rohtasgahr Limestone of some authors) in the Son Valley [111].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent geochronological results from the Semri Group in the region are summarized in Fig 20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Rohtas Limestone in Son Valley has been dated by PbPb isochrons to 1,601Â±130 Ma [110], 1,599Â±48 Ma [112], and 1,514Â±120 Ma [113], respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dates are in agreement with the more precise UPb dates of 1,602Â±10 Ma and 1,593Â±12 Ma obtained from euhedral magmatic zircon grains in tuffs from the immediately underlying Rampur Shale [114].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further down in the Son Valley sequence, tuff layers in the Deonar Porcellanite have been dated with the same zircon UPb method by two independent laboratories to 1,631Â±5 Ma, 1,631Â±1 Ma [115], and 1,628Â±8 Ma [114], respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still further down, the Kajrahat Limestone has yielded two PbPb isochron dates of 1,707Â±190 Ma and 1,729Â±110 Ma [112].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the Kajrahat and Rohtas Limestones have also been published two RbSr dates of 1,014Â±18 Ma and 939Â±22 Ma, respectively [116].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These anomalous dates may be affected by late illite formation [112] but in any case do not support an EdiacaranCambrian age of the Semri Group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A kimberlite pipe at Majhgawan, about 30 km southwest of Chitrakoot, intrudes the Kaimur Sandstone, the lowermost unit of the Upper Vindhyan sequence, which unconformably overlies the Semri Group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Kimberlite has yielded a mean ArAr age of 1,073.5Â±13.7 Ma [117], confirming the pre-Neoproterozoic age of the Lower Vindhyans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For broader reviews of geochronological work on the Vindhyans, see Ray [106], Azmi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [108], and Basu and Bickford [107].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presumed correlative equivalents of the Tirohan Dolomite in the Son Valley have thus been dated with precision and congruence to be very close to 1.6 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is within error margins identical to the 1,650Â±89 Ma age obtained from a PbPb isochron dating directly of the fossiliferous phosphorite in the Tirohan Dolomite at Chitrakoot [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also from the Chitrakoot area, Kumar et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [118] obtained six RbSr dates from glauconies in the Chitrakoot Formation, ranging from 1,409Â±14 Ma to 1,531Â±15 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although younger by some 100200 million years than the above cited dates, the model RbSr ages from the glauconite remain in agreement with an old, PalaeoMesoproterozoic age of the Lower Vindhyan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparatively young age obtained by Kumar et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  may be due to the well-known tendency of Palaeozoic or older glauconite to yield RbSr ages that appear to be too young by 10%20% [119], a phenomenon that can persist even through leaching experiments using a variety of agents [120], including the HCl leaching performed by Kumar et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [118].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ages that are apparently too young even after leaching may also indicate later recrystallization of glauconite [120], although Kumar et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [118] consider this unlikely for their samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biostratigraphic arguments have been forwarded in support of a considerably younger age, EdiacaranCambrian, of the Lower Vindhyans [55,108,109].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With regard to the claims of Cambrian fossils in the Tirohan Dolomite [55,56,108], these were discussed and refuted by us [52] as being based on misidentified algae (Rafatazmia and Denaricion herein), cyanobacterial biomat fragments, and gas bubbles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only cited radiometric date that would support an EdiacaranCambrian age of the Son Valley Lower Vindhyans is a preliminary ArAr date of 617Â±3.5 Ma from the Deonar Porcellanite Formation, published only in a conference abstract [121] and never substantiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A recent study of drill cores through allegedly Lower Vindhyan sedimentary rocks in the western Vindhyan sub-basin, Chambal Valley, Rajasthan, revealed a succession of diverse and well-preserved acanthomorph acritarchs of Ediacaran aspect [109].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors offer two alternative interpretations of this discovery: the Semri Group is Ediacaran in age or complex acanthomorph acritrarchs evolved much earlier than hitherto supposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional alternative may be that the correlation of the investigated sequence with the Lower Vindhyan in Son Valley/Chitrakoot is incorrect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major problem in Vindhyan stratigraphy is the lack of reliable correlation between the eastern (Son Valley and Chitrakoot) and western (Rajasthan) sub-basins owing to differences in lithology, lack of common marker horizons, lack of congruence in chemostratigraphy, lack of biostratigraphically useful fossils, and lack of continuous outcrops [110,122].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Chitrakoot Formation indeed contains large acritarchs with complex wall structure [40,54], but these are not acanthomorphs and rather seem comparable to the assemblages in the ~1.7 Ga Ruyang Group in northern China [38] and the 1.51.4 Ga Roper Group in northern Australia [123].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ~1.6 Ga geochronological date of the Tirohan Dolomite is robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion is based on a congruence of radiometric measurements, but particularly important are the UPb analyses of magmatic zircon, the most precise and accurate absolute dating method for rocks of this age, in the Son Valley Lower Vindhyan [114,115], as well as the direct PbPb isochron dating of the fossiliferous phosphorite [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apparent conflicts with biostratigraphic considerations are likely to be resolved through reexamination of the fossil evidence [52], but in general they serve as an indication that the Proterozoic fossil record of both micro- and megafossils is richer than hitherto recognized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preservation window opened by the phosphorite deposit in the Tirohan Dolomite thus underscores that we have been missing a lot of the biotic diversity in the PalaeoMesoproterozoic because of the dearth of lithologies suitable for fossilization of delicate tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rhodophyte_phylogeny_and_age  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together with chlorophytes and glaucophytes, the rhodophytes belong to the Archaeplastida [124], which seem to have derived their chloroplasts from a single endosymbiotic event involving a cyanobacterial donor [125].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other algal groups obtained their chloroplasts from secondary endosymbiosis with different archaeoplastid groups [126].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Vindhyan putative rhodophytes, having already diversified into multicellular filamentous and lobate forms, would have been subsequent to the primary symbiotic event, and their photosynthetic ability is suggested by the presence of pyrenoid-like structures in Rafatazmia and an apparent phototactic growth mode in Ramathallus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yoon et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [127] recognized seven rhodophyte lineages, among which the florideophyceans and bangiophyceans were united as sister groups within one clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basal phylogenetic relationships were largely unresolved, although the unicellular acidophilic Cyanidiophyceae came out as a sister group to the remaining rhodophytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presented data suggest that crown-group rhodophytesthe putative florideophycean Ramathallus and possible bangiophycean Rafatazmiawere present in the ~1.6 Ga Vindhyan stromatolitic microbialites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether or not these two taxa belong to the extant clades as proposed, they seem to be part of the unresolved clade that forms a sister group to the unicellular cyanidiophyceans and so would belong to crown-group rhodophytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This runs contrary to recent concepts about the evolutionary timing of eukaryote lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several recent molecular-clock studies [16,17,48] have had problems in using the ~1.2 Ga Bangiomorpha [46] as a calibration point for bangiophycean or even rhodophyte appearance, because it had seemed too old to make sense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Molecular-clock estimates of lineage divergence times in the tree of life are heavily dependent on calibration based on occurrences and events in the fossil record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncertainties in fossil calibration have a dominant effect on the dating of nodes in molecular phylogenetic trees [128,129].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first representative of a lineage in the fossil record postdates the origination of that lineage by an unknown interval of time; thus, the age of a fossil only gives a minimum age for the lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the fossilization potential of the particular organisms and the availability of suitable rocks, the interval of uncertainty can be of any length and may be more or less easy to assess.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Phanerozoic, the richness of the rock record and the presence of easily fossilized organisms allow the construction of reasonably reliable calibration intervals [130], but the Proterozoic is by comparison unchartered territory in which fossiliferous deposits are scarce and fossils often controversial in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculated Proterozoic divergence dates are commonly based on extrapolations from Phanerozoic calibration intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Berney and Pawlowski [48] based a calibration of the eukaryote tree on the Phanerozoic microfossil record of coccolithophorids, diatoms, and dinoflagellates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a Bayesian relaxed-clock model, they arrived at dramatically different dates for the divergence of major eukaryote groups depending on whether or not Proterozoic fossils were included in the calibration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When Bangiomorpha was used to set a minimum age for the red algae, the resulting age for LECA was 3,868 Ma, with a 95% confidence interval of 4,1821,830 Ma, whereas exclusion of Bangiomorpha gave a LECA age of 1,126 Ma (1,357947 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, they concluded that Bangiomorpha and other proposed Proterozoic algal and fungal taxa more likely represent basal lineages of eukaryotes convergent on extant lineages and that calibration should be based only on Phanerozoic data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parfrey et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [17] similarly compared divergence dates depending on whether or not Proterozoic fossils were used for calibration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their relaxed-clock results were more stable to the inclusion/exclusion of Proterozoic fossils than those of Berney and Pawlowski [48], yet they found the origination date of the rhodophytes to shift considerably, from 1,2851,180 Ma (95% credible range) to 959625 Ma, when Proterozoic taxa were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parfrey et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [17] favoured the inclusion of the Proterozoic fossils for calibration, leading to a LECA age of 1,8661,679 Ma, older than that of most modern molecular-clock estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result, however, required Bangiomorpha to be placed at the base of the crown-group rhodophytes, not with the bangiophyceans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sharpe et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16], using a relaxed-clock model, estimated the origin of rhodophytes to 996 Ma, with a 95% credible interval of 1,186801 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They found Bangiomorpha, treated as a stem-group multicellular rhodophyte lineage, to be at odds with the calculations and excluded it as a calibration point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They argued that unless Bangiomorpha was not a red alga or incorrectly dated, currently used Bayesian relaxed-clock models might be insufficient to deal with changes in evolutionary rates within lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [47] accepted Bangiomorpha as a rhodophyte, though again not as a bangiophycean but as an early rhodophyte stem group, for calibration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When testing two approaches to assigning prior distributions within their Bayesian relaxed-clock model, they found that the date for bangiophycean/florideophycean divergence shifted from 943 Ma to 1,661 Ma, and because the older date seemingly contradicted the fossil evidence, they preferred the approach yielding the lower age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also found that their results were sensitive to the inclusion of Bangiomorpha, but having included it, they arrived at a rhodophyte/chlorophyte divergence date of 1,693 Ma (1,9251,484 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is older even than the LECA age of most studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There remain a number of theoretical problems to be resolved with molecular-clock datings of ancient divergences, but the pattern that emerges from the above examples is that current models are not adequate to deal with a minimum-age constraint for crown-group multicellular rhodophytes at 1.2 Ga, as defined by Bangiomorpha.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to fit the pattern of calibrations based mainly on Phanerozoic data, Bangiomorpha has to be reclassified as a stem-group eukaryote, as a stem-group rhodophyte, or, at best, near the first representative of the crown-group rhodophytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rafatazmia and Ramathallus are some 400 million years older than Bangiomorpha and are tentatively interpreted as representing multicellular crown-group rhodophytes already diversified into filamentous and fleshy forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would change the constraints dramatically for the timing of divergences within early rhodophytes and within Eukaryota as a whole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maybe this can be accommodated by taking into account previously downplayed possibilities, such as changes in substitution rates in multiple lineages over time [131,132], but the basic task should be to discover and study Archaean and Proterozoic fossils and base interpretations on the available evidence rather than on how they happen to fit into currently accepted time frames [133137].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The studied material derives from field work at Jankikund in November 2006 and January 2011 and was augmented by microfossils kindly supplied by R. Azmi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To isolate phosphatized fossils from the carbonate rocks, samples were dissolved in 10% buffered acetic acid, and the residues were manually picked for microfossils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SEM/ESEM was carried out on a Hitachi S4300 Field Emission scanning electron microscope, a Philips XL 30 ESEM-FEG, and a Quanta ESEM-FEG 650 field emission microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synchrotron-radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) was done at the X02DA TOMCAT beamline at the Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visualization was done using Avizo 9.1.1 (FEI Company).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All specimens are in the collections of the Swedish Museum of Natural History.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each figured specimen has a unique museum number, stated in the respective figure caption in the article.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tomographic data are deposited in the Dryad Digital Repository: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.gh221 [138].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nomenclature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The electronic version of this article in Portable Document Format (PDF) in a work with an ISSN or ISBN will represent a published work according to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, and hence, the new names contained in the electronic publication of a PLOS article are effectively published under that Code from the electronic edition alone, so there is no longer any need to provide printed copies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The online version of this work is archived and available from the following digital repositories: PubMed Central, LOCKSS, and DiVA (www.diva-portal.org/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
