A new osteichthyan from the late Silurian of Yunnan, China  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our understanding of early gnathostome evolution has been hampered by a generally scant fossil record beyond the Devonian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent discoveries from the late Silurian Xiaoxiang Fauna of Yunnan, China, have yielded significant new information, including the earliest articulated osteichthyan fossils from the Ludlow-aged Kuanti Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the partial postcranium of a new primitive bony fish from the Kuanti Formation that represents the second known taxon of pre-Devonian osteichthyan revealing articulated remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new form, Sparalepis tingi gen. et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., displays similarities with Guiyu and Psarolepis, including a spine-bearing pectoral girdle and a placoderm-like dermal pelvic girdle, a structure only recently identified in early osteichthyans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The squamation with particularly thick rhombic scales shares an overall morphological similarity to that of Psarolepis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the anterior flank scales of Sparalepis possess an unusual interlocking system of ventral bulges embraced by dorsal concavities on the outer surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A phylogenetic analysis resolves Sparalepis within a previously recovered cluster of stem-sarcopterygians including Guiyu, Psarolepis and Achoania.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high diversity of osteichthyans from the Ludlow of Yunnan strongly contrasts with other Silurian vertebrate assemblages, suggesting that the South China block may have been an early center of diversification for early gnathostomes, well before the advent of the Devonian Age of Fishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Osteichthyans, comprising the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) and Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes and tetrapods), display a remarkable diversity with over 60,000 extant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their origins and early evolution are obscured by the rarity and typically fragmentary nature of pre-Devonian fossil material [1,2,3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exceptional new data is being revealed via ongoing discoveries from a series of late Silurian (Pridoli and Ludlow) marine strata at Qujing, Yunnan Province, southwestern China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ascending order, the sequence consists of the Yuejiashan, Kuanti, Miaokao and Yulungssu formations [4,5,6,7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fossil assemblage of the lower three formations is collectively referred to as the Xiaoxiang Fauna, in reference to the nearby Xiaoxiang reservoir [5,6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular importance are collections from the Kuanti Formation of late Ludlow age (Fig 1), revealing a diverse assemblage of early fishes, including the only known articulated fossils of pre-Devonian osteichthyans [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A rich fossil invertebrate fauna, including corals, molluscs and trilobites, indicates a productive marine environment [5,7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kuanti osteichthyians include Guiyu oneiros [8], the large but fragmentary Megamastax amblyodus [9], and the scale-based Naxilepis gracilis [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other jawed fishes include undescribed acanthodians [5,6] along with various placoderms [10], including Silurolepis [11] and the two maxillate placoderms Entelognathus [12] and Qilinyu [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior to the discovery of the superbly preserved holotypes of Guiyu and Entelognathus, pre-Devonian gnathostomes were represented only by highly fragmentary material [1,2,10,14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The anatomy of these newly discovered Silurian fishes has narrowed the morphological gap between basal sarcopterygians and actinopterygians [8], as well as between early osteichthyans and placoderms [8,12,13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unambiguous presence of dermal pelvic girdles in Guiyu facilitated the identification of isolated plate-like bones from the Early Devonian Xitun Formation, Yunnan, as the pelvic girdles of the enigmatic osteichthyan Psarolepis romeri [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior to these discoveries, pelvic girdles with extensive dermal components were thought to be restricted to extinct gnathostome groups, specifically the pelvic spines of acanthodians and the fully developed girdles of placoderms [15,16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phylogenetic positions of Guiyu, Psarolepis and other Silurian-Early Devonian osteichthyans are currently under scrutiny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guiyu and Psarolepis are usually resolved as stem sarcopterygians [8,15,17,18,19,20,21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent analyses incorporating these taxa plus Achoania, another Xitun form [20], resolve a cluster of these three genera as the sister group to the remaining sarcopterygians [8,12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However these fish manifest combinations of features found in sarcopterygians, actinopterygians (cheek and opercular-gular bone configuration, scale articulation) and non-osteichthyans (median dorsal plates, morphology of appendicular girdles, absence of tooth enamel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such incongruent character distribution has led to suggestions of an alternative phylogenetic position for these forms as stem-group osteichthyans [15,20,21,22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A well preserved fossil osteichthyan, consisting of a partial postcranium (Fig 2), was collected from the Kuanti Formation on the outskirts of Qujing in 2009.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is distinct from other early osteichthyans due to its unusual scale morphology and dermal ornamentation, although it shares several features with Guiyu and Psarolepis, including spine-bearing dermal pelvic and pectoral girdles, characters also present in placoderms [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new form represents the second known Silurian bony fish with an unambiguously associated dermal pelvic girdle, and its new character combination adds significantly to our understanding of early osteichthyan anatomy and diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The holotype comprises an articulated partial postcranium in flattened dorsal view, from near the base of the skull to about 2 cm beyond the base of the 2nd dorsal fin spine, an interclavicle with an associated ventral scute, a left cleithrum and a right dermal pelvic girdle (Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming limited displacement of the posterior section of scales, which is folded perpendicular to the rest of the specimen, the preserved section accounts for a body length of roughly 11cm, suggesting a complete fish of a little over 20 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phylogenetic_results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The discovery of Sparalepis provides a second taxon of Silurian osteichthyan, along with Guiyu, known from a substantial portion of the skeleton (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the phylogenetic position of Sparalepis, we conducted phylogenetic analyses using the dataset presented by Qiao et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [35] with the addition of character 336: Relationship of crown and base of isolated trunk scale: crown fully covering the base (0); crown sitting on the bony base, with an exposed depressed field overlapped by adjacent scale in articulation (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dataset (S1 Text and S1 Dataset) was modified from that of Long et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [36], which was in turn expanded and modified from previous analyses [8,37,38,39], and further expanded from Giles et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [40], Brazeau and de Winter [41], and Lu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The character data entry and formatting were performed in Mesquite (version 2.5) [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All characters were treated as unordered and weighted equally, as in the earlier versions of this dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two agnathan taxa (Galeaspida and Osteostraci) were set as the outgroup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dataset was subjected to the parsimony analysis in TNT software package [44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analyses were run using a traditional search strategy, with default settings apart from the following: 10,000 maximum trees in memory and 1,000 replications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bremer support and bootstrap values were calculated using TNT [44], with heuristic searches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis generated 2496 trees of 957 steps (CI = 0.3772; HI = 0.6228; RI = 0.8070; RCI = 0.3044), a strict consensus of which (Fig 8A) broadly agrees with the favoured hypothesis of Zhu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [12] with placoderms recovered as a paraphyletic array of stem gnathostomes, acanthodians as a paraphyletic array of stem chondrichthyans, and Entelognathus as the immediate sister group of crown gnathostomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One most parsimonious tree (S1 Fig), which agrees well with the 50% majority-rule consensus (Fig 8B), is selected for illustrating inferred character transformations at various nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sparalepis, is consistently clustered with Guiyu, Achoania and Psarolepis; they together are positioned at the base of the Sarcopterygii, collectively forming the sister group of crown-group sarcopterygians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously described as a "Psarolepis-Guiyu cluster" [15], this putative clade is here informally referred to as the "psarolepids" for the sake of simplicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Key synapomorphies uniting these taxa in this analysis (S1 Fig) include spines associated with the dorsal (character 122, state 1), pectoral (character 124, state 1), and pelvic fins (character 240, state 1); median dorsal plates (character 104, state 1); a dermal pelvic girdle (character 239, state 0) and an adsymphysial tooth whorl (character 41, state 1, their presence in Guiyu and Psarolepis is inferred on the basis of facets on the anterior dentaries of these taxa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These purported synapomorphies are problematic as all but the tooth whorls are present among the gnathostome stem-group (= placoderms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, adsymphysial tooth whorls are widely distributed among disparate branches of the gnathostome crown group (onychodonts, porolepiforms, the actinopterygian Howqualepis and the acanthodian Poracanthodes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our analysis, large spines anterior to the appendicular and dorsal fins are lost in the stem-group Osteichthyes prior to the node containing Dialipina and crown-Osteichthyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Median dorsal plates and plate-like dermal pelvic girdles are lost in the gnathostome stem prior to the node containing the osteicthyan and chondrichthyan total groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus with the available data, the broad suite of placoderm-like characters present in the psarolepids are resolved as homoplasies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At present the psarolepid cluster contains the totality of Silurian crown-gnathostomes known from reasonably complete remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Guiyu and Sparalepis are known from articulated specimens whereas the disarticulated remains of Psarolepis are sufficiently comparable to these forms to reconstruct a substantial proportion of its anatomy [15,27,28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other two Silurian genera, Lophosteus and Andreolepis, are highly fragmentary as is Meemannia from the Lockhovian [45], recently posited as a stem-actinopterygian [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Early Devonian Dialipina is known from complete specimens [47] that display an unusual (for an osteichthyan) dermal configuration of numerous small cranial and gnathal plates, presenting difficulties in determining homologies with other bony fishes [25] and possibly suggesting some degree of anatomical specialization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This taxon remains enigmatic and demands further scrutiny [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The placoderm-like characters highlighted in the psarolepids are also absent among the basal actinopterygians based on the available fossil record, although the clade that is not represented by reasonably complete material from before the Middle Devonian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the presence of Silurian sarcopterygians necessitates the existence of Silurian actinopterygians, indisputable pre-Devonian representatives are currently unknown [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the striking anatomical disparity of forms like Guiyu and Sparalepis when compared to Middle-Late Devonian sarcopterygians, their discovery and description has profoundly enhanced our understanding of early sarcopterygian anatomy [8,15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may allude to the scope of our limitations regarding early actinopterygian evolution without the benefit of similarly complete Silurian fossil representatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An increasing body of evidence, including the strong morphological similarities of the paired-fin girdles and fin-spines between placoderms and psarolepids [8,15,28], similar dermal arrangements between the skulls of stem-gnathostomes Entelognathus [12, 49], Qilinyu [13] and Janusiscus [40] with crown-group Osteichthyes, and placoderm-like features noted in the early osteichthyan Lophosteus [50] provide compelling support for a placoderm-like ancestral bauplan for the osteichthyan total-group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When combined with our currently limited knowledge of pre-Devonian osteichthyan diversity and anatomy, it raises the possibility that the putative synapomorphies uniting the psarolepids in this analysis may ultimately prove to represent osteichthyan symplesiomorphies with the benefit additional fossil data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, it remains unclear at present as to whether the psarolepids constitute a genuine clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Xiaoxiang_Fauna_as_an_indicator_of_an_early_center_of_osteichthyan_diversification_in_South_China  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the earliest record of putative gnathostomes may extend as far back as the Ordovician [51,52], until very recently the available fossil record of Silurian gnathostomes was scarce and highly fragmentary [1,2,3,10,16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior to the discoveries of the exceptional Kuanti specimens [8,12,13,15], the only articulated fossil gnathostome dating from the Silurian was the acanthodian-like Yealepis from the Ludlow of Victoria, Australia, based on an incomplete postcranium [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silurian ichthyofaunal assemblages in Eurasia and North America are dominated by 'ostracoderms', a paraphyletic grade of jawless fishes including heterostracans, thelodonts, galeaspids and osteostracans [16, 54] with gnathostomes generally being poorly represented, although there has been a substantial increase in fossil evidence in recent decades [54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent discoveries from South China and Vietnam suggest a greater diversity of late Silurian jawed vertebrates than has previously been recognised [54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Silurian placoderm fossils are rare and putative in Eurasia and Gondwana but were apparently well established in the South China block based on well preserved and unambiguous remains, including antiarchs and arthrodire-like taxa [11,12,13,54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With regards to bony fishes, the Ludlow Xiaoxiang Fauna displays a far greater diversity of osteichthyans than any other fossil assemblage of comparable age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outside of the South China block, the pre-Devonian osteichthyan fossil record primarily comprises only two genera based on highly fragmentary remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lophosteus, with four described Silurian species and additional Devonian forms, is a widely distributed genus from the Baltic region, the Timan-Rechora region Arctic Canada and Australia, ranging in time from the Ludlow to Lochkovian [50,55,56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Andreolepis, based on two species, is known from the Baltic region, northern Timan, the Central Urals and the Novavya Zemlya and Severnaya Zemlya archipelagos with a mid-Ludlow to Early Pridoli time range [33,52,56,57,58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This contrasts sharply with the diversity of osteichthyans present in Ludlow Xiaoxiang Fauna with at least six taxa in the combined assemblage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these from the Kuanti Formation are the two only articulated Silurian taxa, Guiyu oneiros and Sparalepis tingi, as well as the largest pre-Devonian vertebrate, Megamastax amblyodus (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least two additional Kuanti forms are currently awaiting description based on recently prepared articulated specimens within the IVPP collections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the two scale-based Xiaoxiang taxa, Naxilepis gracilis is present in the Kuanti and the overlying Miaokao Formation while Ligulalepis yunnanensis is restricted to the Miaokao [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pridoli sediments from South China are not as well sampled, but material from the Yulungssu Formation includes an indeterminable osteichthyan [5] and Psarolepis romeri, a species also present in roughly contemporaneous deposits in Vietnam [5,16,21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Devonian record of South China, combining the oldest fossil appearances of key groups and containing the most phylogenetically basal fossil taxa have established this region as a possible center of origin for several crown-group sarcopterygian lineages, including anatomically modern coelacanths [59], lungfishes [60] and tetrapodomorphs [6163].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of diversified stem-sarcopterygians in the Silurian of South China reveals a rich regional history of osteichthyans extending as far back as the early Ludlow, indicative of an as yet largely unknown chapter in early gnathostome evolution well before the advent of the Devonian Age of Fishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
