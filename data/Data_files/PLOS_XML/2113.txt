Shifting gears: Diversification, intensification, and effort increases in small-scale fisheries (1950-2010)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Locally sustainable resource extraction activities, at times, transform into ecologically detrimental enterprises.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding such transitions is a primary challenge for conservation and management of many ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marine systems, over-exploitation of small-scale fisheries creates problems such as reduced biodiversity and lower catches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, long-term documentation of how governance and associated changes in fishing gears may have contributed to such declines is often lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using fisher interviews, we characterized fishing gear dynamics over 60 years (19502010) in a coral reef ecosystem in the Philippines subject to changing fishing regulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In aggregate fishers greatly diversified their use of fishing gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most individual fishers used one or two gears at a time (mean number of fishing gears less_than 2 in all years).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual fishing effort (days per year) was fairly steady over the study period, but cumulative fishing effort by all fishers increased 240%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we document large increases in total effort by fishers using nets and diving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other fishing gears experienced less pronounced changes in total effort over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fishing intensified through escalating use of non-selective, active, and destructive fishing gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that policies promoting higher production over sustainability influenced the use of fishing gears, with changes in gear use persisting decades after those same policies were stopped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our quantitative evidence shows dynamic changes in fishing gear use over time and indicates that gears used in contemporary small-scale fisheries impact oceans more than those used in earlier decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Long-term assessment of natural resource exploitation is critical to understanding ecosystem change and how governance affects those changes [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contemporary ecosystems are shaped by their history of disturbances and human interventions [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These historical impacts influence the distribution of species and habitats that we see today and can affect modern-day ecosystem functioning and services [3,4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the historical context can inform managers and other actors tasked to understand current conditions and to direct future ecological change [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The need for a grounded historical perspective and the integration of non-traditional data sources are particularly apparent for small-scale fisheries [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although small-scale fisheries use small boats with basic fishing equipment, they represent a critical component of global fisheries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small-scale fisheries collectively employ over 230 million people in the direct and indirect sectors [8], and have edible catches rivaling those of industrial fisheries [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Widespread overfishing has led to international commitments to improve their sustainability (FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries) [10] and a call for research to assess the effectiveness of management approaches [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although catch declines in these fisheries are often attributed to the shift towards unsustainable fishing activities, little long-term information exists to contextualize or quantify these changes [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many cases, the trajectories of small-scale fisheries remain undocumented because they involve a large number of fishers (25 times more individuals than industrial fisheries), are decentralized, and occur in countries with limited governance, funds, and/or technical expertise [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such data-poor systems, local environmental knowledge (LEK) can provide information about the history of ecosystems and the practices of humans who depend on them [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evaluating the choice of fishing methods and associated gearssuch as fish traps and drift-netsdeployed over time is one key to understanding small-scale fisheries [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small-scale fisheries use many fishing gears and catch a plethora of fish and invertebrate species (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cephalopods, gastropods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fishers adapt gear usage for changing biophysical conditions (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tides, depth), different habitats (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coral, seagrass), as well as to incorporate species behavior [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, fishers can change gears and adjust the effort allocated to various gears in response to the availability of marine life, evolving biophysical conditions, and market competition [1315].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fishing intensification by the use of more efficient fishing gears and methods can provide higher catch efficiency and fisheries yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensive fishing methods can be valuable for fishers and coastal communities when marine life populations are strained, but their higher catch efficiency may also come with greater environmental costs [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, some gears with high catch efficiency also damage marine habitats [17] or catch non-target and juvenile marine life (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bycatch) [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, trends in gear use can be used to identify trends in fishing intensification and infer fishing impacts to ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The management and governance of small-scale fisheries can incorporate a variety of approaches, but often include gear restrictions and protected areas [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Management as well as institutional approaches to governance change over time, reflecting dynamic societal priorities and values [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, governance that prioritizes the goals of a central government frequently maintains hierarchical management institutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, governance that values local empowerment may develop co-management institutions based on local participation [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many countries, institutional priorities have swung from an emphasis on extraction and resource exploitation in the 1970s and 1980s [22] to a contemporary focus on sustainability [10,23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent to which resource users change their practices in step with governance priorities is influenced by how strongly past practices constrain and guide future choices (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the memory of the system) [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The need for effective management is particularly relevant in small-scale fisheries targeting coral reefs in the Philippines, a country of global priority for biodiversity conservation [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coral reefs are among the most productive and biologically diverse ecosystems in the world, but face many stressors including climate change, destructive fishing, overfishing, and pollution [26,27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the apex of the Coral Triangle, the Philippines is located in the global epicenter of marine biodiversity [28] and contains the third most extensive reef system in the world (about 22,000 km2) [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The country is highly dependent on fishing for food and livelihoods [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reef fisheries in the Philippines once provided up to 37 tons per km2 per year, but catches throughout the country have sharply declined [3133].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to its combination of high biodiversity and high threats, the management of Philippine small-scale fisheries is an important challenge globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we characterize 60 years of fishing gear dynamics in a small-scale fishery in the central Philippines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examine a time period (19502010) coinciding with extensive changes in fisheries governance, ecosystem degradation, declining catches, and increasing populace [3437].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ask two questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, do historical trends in the use of fishing gears indicate intensification and/or a growing ecological impact from these fisheries?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, is there evidence that fishing gear trends are influenced by changes in fisheries governance priorities?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As no long-term records of fishing practices exist in our study area, we used local environmental knowledge to document the history of fishing gear use, including changes in the diversity of gears in use and the use of illegal gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also evaluated changes in fishing intensity as reflected by fishing effort and the use of active, non-selective, and destructive gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We focused on small-scale fisheries in the Danajon Bank (Central Visayas, Philippines; 10Â°150N, 124Â°80E; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This case study is representative of small-scale fisheries where there is a combination of low technology, high biodiversity, and a large number of fishers dependent on marine resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the spatial segregation of small-scale fisheries and industrial fisheries (see details below) provides a rare opportunity to explore the development and impacts of small-scale fisheries in isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Danajon Bank coral reef ecosystem is characterized by large proportion of degraded habitats [38] and exceptionally low biomass of fish (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  demersal fish biomass 0.45 tons/sq km) [39]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Danajon Bank sits off the northern and northwestern coasts of Bohola province that struggles with extreme poverty and minimal infrastructure [40], traits that are typical of places supporting small-scale fisheries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fishing is a primary human activity influencing the Danajon Bank because of the high population density and lack of alternative livelihoods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Danajon Bank lies very close to Cebu City, the second largest metropolitan area in the Philippines (with 2.8 million people).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the Danajon Banks communities are rural and travel links to the city are weak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Contemporary fisheries management in the Philippines emphasizes co-management, gear restrictions, spatial restrictions, and marine protected areas (MPAs) [34,41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Philippines, small-scale fishers are legally known as municipal fishers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To participate in these fisheries, boats must weigh 3 gross tons or less.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most fishers use outrigger canoe style boats, but engine-use has increased from approximately 20% of boats in 1960 to 50% of boats in 2010 [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small-scale fisheries in the Danajon Bank are multi-gear, multi-species, and effectively open-access [42,43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filipino laws have given small-scale fishers exclusive rights to fish in inshore waters less_than 15 km from coasts since 1991.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entire Danajon Bank falls within inshore waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite ongoing management efforts, heavy fishing pressure, destructive fishing, and high population densities continue to apply huge pressures on marine ecosystems [35,43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study focused on an 800 km2 section of the central Danajon Bank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This area spanned five municipalities, two provinces, and a gradient from inshore turbid waters to offshore clear waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Eras_of_fisheries_governance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Six decades were examined in our study and partitioned into governance eras based on extensive review of government fisheries documents, legislation and development projects, and other published and online sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on the three aspects: (i) level of organization and power, (ii) aims and values of fisheries legislation, and (iii) aims and values of development funding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each was evaluated according to its management tools, institutional formation, as well as underlying principles and values, thereby providing information on different aspects of governance [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent participation in co-management was characterized by: (i) presence of community-established marine protected areas (MPAs) and (ii) participation in fisher organizations (details in Fisher Interviews).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fisher_interviews  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To document temporal changes in fishing activities, we drew on LEK by conducting semi-structured interviews between July 2010 and April 2011 (n = 391 fishers) in 23 fishing communities (approximately 50% of the communities in the study area; S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LEK integrates the customary knowledge, practices, and beliefs of communities regarding the local environment and their relationship with it [44,45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We stratified fishing communities by their location (Coastal, Terrestrial Islands, Cayes; Fig 1) [46] to ensure we captured representative samples of fishing gears adapted to local environmental differences (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mangroves vs. reefs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then proportionally sampled randomly-selected communities from within each group using a randomly-generated numbered list.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained written consent from municipal mayors, in accordance with Philippine laws, and oral consent from elected village officials, as well as every individual respondent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When oral consent was given by respondents, it was recorded on consent forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oral consent was most appropriate culturally and preferable due to the low levels of education and literacy among some participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research methods, including consent procedures, were approved by the University of British Columbias Human Behavioural Research Ethics Board (H07-00577).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within each participating community, we identified fishers using village-level census data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the Philippines, census records are collected regularly by community health workers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where occupational data was incomplete, outdated, unclear, or had questionable accuracy (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25 year olds listed as high school students), health workers provided missing information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, health workers identified those fishers who had moved or passed away.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used village census records rather than municipal records of fishers because we found that municipal data severely underestimated the number of all people who fished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Census occupational data also provide a conservative estimate of fishers because these records do not include children or women who fish [47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not attempt to correct for this bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within each fishing community, we randomly sampled 7% of full-time and part-time fishers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain longer time series of information, we stratified fishers by age, focusing on fishers born before 1981 whom we estimated had been fishing for at least 15 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method may underrepresent recent trends influenced by young fishers, but prioritizes a long time-series of fishing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interviews were conducted in the local language (Cebuano) by two Cebuano-fluent local research assistants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During interviews, we systematically reconstructed the history of the respondents fishing practices, as far back as the respondent could remember, using three steps [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we constructed personal timelines for each respondent which helped fishers link reported changes in fishing practices with important dates (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  age started fishing; date of childrens births) [49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we determined which years each respondent fished in the Danajon Bank (either full- or part-time), any periods where he stopped fishing, as well as any monthly or migratory patterns in his fishing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the days per year that a respondent fished in our study area was used to quantify individual fishing effort (number of days fished per year by individual fishers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As some respondents migrated to other provinces for several months a year, we excluded any fishing activities outside of the Danajon Bank from this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we made timelines for each fishing gear that each respondent used in our study area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each gear, we recorded the years the respondent fished with the gear and any details he shared about the fishing gear (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  catch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During interviews we validated the consistency of fisher responses using internal triangulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We asked about key information during multiple questions, which allowed us to cross-check the consistency of fishers responses (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  triangulation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enabled us to correct inconsistent or illogical answers during interviews [50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on fishing gears and effort rather than catches as these aspects of fishing tend to be relatively consistent over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This consistency makes gears and effort easier to recall than variable aspects of fishing, such as catches [51,52]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Indicators_of_co-management_participation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fishers organizations are one official component of Philippine local co-management structure, as outlined by the 1998 Fisheries Code (RA 8550).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sought to evaluate the presence of these organizations, and the level of fisher engagement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We asked a subset of respondents (n = 256 fishers) whether fishers organizations existed in their communities, whether they participated in the fishers organizations, and the year that they had joined the organizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also used expert interviews with local community organizers to confirm information about when fisher organizations were established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since MPAs are a second component of local fisheries co-management (RA 8550), we identified which communities had established MPAs through expert interviews, websites of municipal governments, and published literature [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fishing_gear_classifications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For gear classifications, we developed a database based on information derived from surveys as well as from key informants, our own field knowledge, and published literature on fishing gears [12,17,32,5461].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assigned each specific gear to one of eight general gear classes that we set to fit the small-scale fisheries context (Table 1) [48]: hook & line, nets, diving, traps, blast fishing, poison, fish corrals, and gleaning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, hook-and-line methods include gears with various numbers of hooks, lines, and weights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In coral reefs, fishing gears span a range of intensities, from hand-reeled lines that catch one fish at a time (handlines), to homemade explosives that kill entire schools of fish and shatter adjacent corals (blast fishing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define intensive fishing gears as those with a high catch efficiency, a great magnitude of force, and/or a relatively low selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, intensive gears have higher catchability and are more efficient than non-intensive gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, intensive gears may cause more extensive changes to the ecosystem (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  via damaging habitat, catching juveniles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although illegal fishing gears are not inherently intensive, the majority of illegal gears in the Philippines are also intensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus we group illegal gears with intensive gears, while recognizing that this relationship may not be relevant in other contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fishing intensification differs from agricultural intensification [62], because there are no inputs that influence production (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fertilizer) and no opportunity for selecting high yield varieties because fishers target available species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus there is an increase in extractive effort, without a corresponding effort to support the systems productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the intensity and impacts from small-scale fishing gears have rarely been quantified, assessing changes in gears provides a process for evaluating the potential impacts of fishing (but see, for example, [17,18,61] for small-scale fisheries).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assigned the 93 specific fishing gears into four pairs of intensive/non-intensive categories: destructive/non-destructive; active/passive; non-selective/selective; and illegal/legal [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Destructive gears damage habitats (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  blast fishing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actively moving gears heavily exploit marine life (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  trawling) and raise concerns in fisheries conservation (for example, [63]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-selective gears catch juveniles and non-target species (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  small-mesh nets) [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Illegal gears may be intensive or may be prohibited for other reasons (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dangerous for fishers), and are defined by regulations rather than by impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some gears were illegal throughout the study period (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  blast fishing), while other gears became illegal during the study period (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fishing with a crowbar which damages habitat and thus became illegal under the 1998 Fisheries Code).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We placed each specific gear in only one category within each pair (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  destructive or non-destructive), but a fishing gear could belong to more than one intensive category (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  beach seines are destructive, active, and non-selective).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eras_of_fisheries_governance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the past 60 years, fisheries governance in the Philippines has changed substantially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We split those changes into four eras, to which we have assigned periods and names: Traditional Governance with Limited State Involvement (19501971); Productivity (19721985); Decentralized Governance (19861997); and Co-management (19982010).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These eras were distinguished by differences in governance priorities (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  production, sustainability) and relative influence of local vs. state institutions in the implementation of fishing policies (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Indicators_of_co-management_participation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When we examined proxies for governance participation during the Co-management Era, we found that 74% of villages had established fishers organizations and 19% of fishers were members of fishers organizations, with much variation in participation (080%) among villages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all, 70% of study villages had locally implemented MPAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Villages established MPAs between 1996 and 2007.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All but one MPA were established after 1998, the first year that local governments had the autonomy to establish MPAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Trends_in_individual_and_aggregate_fishing_gears  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the four governance eras, fishers reported using 93 fishing gears, which we categorized into eight general classes: diving, nets, traps, hook-and-line, gleaning, corrals, poison, and blast fishing (Table 2) [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some gears were designed to target specific species (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  jigs for octopuses) while other fishing methods aimed to catch anything of value (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  skin diving).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over their fishing careers, individuals used a mean of 2.47 (Â± 0.07 SEM) gears (range: 17 gears over their careers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual fishers used anywhere from 16 fishing gears in a single year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean number of gears used by individual fishers in a given year increased over time (Kruskal-Wallis X2 = 20.94 df = 3, p less_than 0.001), but remained below two in all eras (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gear diversity (richness), the number of gears cumulatively used by all respondents, ranged from 975 gears per year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid growth in diversity was evident from the 1950s onwards, peaking during the Productivity Era (Fig 2B; Kruskal-Wallis X2 = 21.62, df = 3, p less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High Simpsons Index of Diversity was found across all eras, suggesting that most gears were used by a relatively small proportion of fishers (Fig 2C; range = 0.870.96, Kruskal-Wallis X2 = 14.27, df = 3, p = 0.003).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Trends_in_individual_and_aggregate_fishing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From 19602010 mean individual fishing effort remained fairly steady (range: 228262 days per year; Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, total fishing effort increased 2.4 fold, from approximately 576,000 fishing days per year in 1960 to approximately 1,363,000 days per year in 2010 (Fig 3B) [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

General_fishing_gears  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found oscillations in the dominant fishing gears for both common and uncommon gears (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Initially, hook & line gears and nets had the highest total fishing effort, and this gradually transitioned to dominance by nets and diving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The four uncommon fishing gear categories showed highly variable patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most years, these four gears each contributed to less than 6% of the total fishing effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intensive__non-intensive__and_illegal_fishing_gears  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relative distribution of intensive and non-intensive categories was consistent over time (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report a steady rise in total effort by all intensive fishing gears over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 19602010 total fishing effort increased for destructive gears (3.4 fold increase), active gears (3.0 fold increase), and non-selective gears (1.5 fold increase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the Decentralization Era began (1986 onward), the percent of fishing effort allocated to these three intensive gears and the proportion of fishers using these gears remained relatively steady.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this steady pattern of relative fishing effort did not translate to total fishing effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the Decentralization and Co-management Eras, total fishing effort using these three intensive gear categories continued to increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During our study period, total effort by illegal gears declined by a factor of 1.7 until 1998 (Fig 5; S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the 1998 Fisheries Act, many existing gears became illegal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the use of illegal fishing gears (total effort, relative effort, and the proportion of fishers) using illegal gears exhibited an 8.4 increase in 1998.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this change, total effort by illegal gears remained relatively steady.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in 2009 and 2010 total effort by illegal gears increased 1.2 fold from approximately 231,000 to 265,000 days per year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Non-intensive gears also increased during the period under study, but these increases were more gradual than for their intensive counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 19602010 total fishing effort increased for non-destructive gears (2.2 fold increase), passive gears (2.0 fold increase), and selective gears (1.3 fold increase) (Fig 5; S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of fishers using non-intensive gears declined slightly over time, although these changes were relatively small (non-destructive and passive = 1.1 fold decrease; non-selective = 1.4 fold decrease) (S4 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Our rare and integrated analysis of small-scale fishing over six decades found that fishing gears have diversified, intensified, and that total fishing effort and use of gears with high ecological impacts has greatly increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the number of fishers grew, there was a corresponding increase in the diversity of fishing gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the systemic increase in the total number of gears used, most individual fishers used fewer than three gears over their entire careers and only one or two gears each year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found individuals fished a relatively consistent number of days per year throughout the period under study, but that total fishing effort across the study area increased 240%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that fishing effort is not distributed evenly in space, and there is evidence that some locations experience substantially greater increases in effort than those documented here [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fishers increased their total effort using nets and diving, with other fishing gears showing less pronounced changes in total effort over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When evaluating gears according to intensity, we documented increasing use of non-selective, active, and destructive gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mounting use of these intensive gears outpaced the growth of their non-intensive counterparts (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  selective, passive, and non-destructive gears).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This burgeoning of gear diversity, effort, and intensity, occurred before the mid-1980s, underscoring the value of a long-term perspective for understanding the development of small-scale fisheries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Benefits_of_gear_diversification_and_persistence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This diversification of fishing gears may benefit fishers in four ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, targeting many species through gear diversification can improve the economic value of catches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, catching a large number of species benefited Kenyan fishers by increasing catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and mean trophic levels of catches [77].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, new gears potentially enable catch of new species, a necessary substitution when original targets decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the central Philippines, for example, substitution allowed continuation of fishing after apparent extirpation of formerly targeted species [78].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, catching new species can allow fishers to take advantage of emerging opportunities, such as access to global markets for species such as seahorses, sea cucumbers, and abalone [15,79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infer that the shift we documented from dominant hook-and-line fishing effort to dive fishing effort indicates a corresponding shift in targeted species from primarily fishes (caught by hook-and-line [47]) to a mix of fish and invertebrates (caught by divers [47]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Danajon Bank, shifts in targeted species has been observed by previous research [72], but not linked to corresponding changes in fishing gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, new gears can provide a competitive edge for catching previously-targeted species in novel ways (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  new habitats; new life history stages).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, modifications can improve gear efficiency and gear longevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In European fleets, for example, small, step-wise modifications in gears during the last century and large changes in gears over the past two hundred years led to significant increases in catchability [13,80].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, respondents described how modifications of gears can improve gear longevity by incorporating durable materials (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  shifts from bamboo to plastic materials for traps).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infer that the increasing numbers of gears, combined with increasing distance travelled [42], helped offset growing total fishing effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, high fishing effort resulted in decreasing gear diversity in a Kenyan small-scale fishery where accelerated use of destructively efficient nets diminished the use of other gears [77].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We documented strong inertia of familiar fishing gears, highlighting the long-term implications of governance priorities and policies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found the greatest relative increase in active and non-selective gears during a period when Filipino governance emphasized resource exploitation to meet economic goals including, putatively, food security (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Productivity Era) [22,71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this period, development programs in the Philippines provided fishers with more efficient gears [69], which then lingered for the long-term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the use of active and non-selective fishing gears persisted for decades, even after Filipino governance priorities shifted towards sustainable fishing [32,81].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 'stickiness' of these changes is evidence that policies created under the ethos of one era can have a lasting, and possibly unintended influence on future practices [82].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of damaging gears may persist for many reasons including familiarity, poverty, social norms, lack of knowledge about the link between destructive gears and diminishing catches, and prohibitive startup costs or time for learning new methods [83,84].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Where poverty is common, households frequently diversify their sources of revenue [85] often involving different livelihoods (e.g., gold panning, agriculture, forestry and fishing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its conceivable that diversifying the methods used to maintain a single livelihood activity, such as fishing, could achieve outcomes similar to diverse livelihood portfolios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found, individually, each fisher used relatively few gears, a choice with implications for their livelihood portfolios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where livelihood opportunities are sparse, use of several gear types might arguably reduce a fishers dependency on one group of species, as well as protect fishers from ecological [12,86] and market variability [57,85].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet fishers on Danajon Bank did not adopt this strategy, instead relying on few gears (12) at any given time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result supports previous findings that fishers may not perceive benefits from diversifying their gears [87], or that fishers can be limited by the skills or capital investment required for new gears [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corollary is that fishers may perceive or acquire greater benefits by using existing gears [88] or by diversifying into other livelihoods beyond fishing [89].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantifying_historical_fishing_activities_with_LEK  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A lasting ability to manage resources requires historical context for current conditions, relying on estimate of long-term trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In data-poor situations, such estimates must rely on diverse data sources [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our research confirms the role of local knowledge in developing a quantitative understanding of changes in resource extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work collected local knowledge in a technically rigorous fashion (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  through randomization of villages and respondents), providing information otherwise unavailable on six decades of fishing practices and their impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge that local knowledge has limitations, such as the loss of details over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we assume that fishing estimates from the earlier years under study (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traditional Governance Era) are less precise than later eras.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variance was reflected in the error measurements from that period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To some extent these limitations can be mitigated with appropriate sampling and survey designs [49], such as those we used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recognize that young fishers (born after 1981), for whom we have a relatively smaller sample, could have made very different choices regarding type of fishing gears and frequency of use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, fishers who stopped fishing by the time of the survey may have been under-represented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our novel approach still provides useful information and is flexible enough to be applied to other resource management contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implications_for_fisheries_management  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reducing fishing effort in small-scale fisheries requires striking a careful balance between ending overexploitation of ecosystems and building adaptive capacity within fishing communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our investigation of historical patterns is relevant to the challenges facing long-term fisheries management for a variety of reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results revealed large increases in total fishing effort by non-selective, active, and destructive fishing gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As fishing effort is highly concentrated in space, there is evidence that there was a significantly higher growth of fishing effort in popular fishing locations [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This knowledge of past change supports establishment of appropriate fishing targets and planning for future changes a system can accommodate [90].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, scaling back active and non-selective fishing methods to 1980 levels of effort would require a 56% reduction in fishing effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such reduction is similar to that recommended by other evaluations of small-scale fishing in the Philippines [81].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, it will be both important and rather complicated to shift fishers away from intensive fishing practices that may be well-entrenched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stickiness of familiar fishing gears we observed also indicates that use of non-intensive gears would persist once established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increasing prevalence of intensive fishing gears, however, combined with the large increases in total effort, potentially results in more ecological impacts than effort increases solely using non-intensive gears [91].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, there are few studies that focus on the effects of changing small-scale fishing gears in coral reefs, but existing evidence does point to benefits from eliminating intensive gear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Kenyan fishing grounds that excluded beach seinesa destructive, active, and non-selective gearhad higher catches than sites where such intensive gears were used [91].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Benefits were short-lived, however, later reduced by long-term increases in overall fishing effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful gear management could emphasize reductions in effort and intensive gears as synergistic goals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any shift towards non-intensive gears would involve dual approaches encouraging existing fishers to switch gears and/or ensuring new fishers adopt less damaging gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the Philippines implements recent revisions to the 1998 Fisheries Code, prioritizing conservation, protection and sustained management of the country's fishery and aquatic resources [23], managers should consider how to incentivize fishers to discard intensive gear and dissuade new fishers from their adoption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Third (and a corollary of the second), managers should be vigilant regarding new emerging fishing gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The progressive diversification of gears we observed occurred through both technology creep (modification of existing gears) [13], as well as development of entirely new gears [80].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adaptions in net materials and mesh size substantially effect catches [18], but this facet of fishing gears was not consistently available from our interview data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A forward-looking advantage of the Philippines broad fishing laws (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  prohibition of all habitat damaging gears) is that it encompasses new gears with undesirable externalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pro-active restrictions on development of new, intensive gears through regulations based on collateral impacts (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  habitat damage, low selectivity), rather than regulations focusing on specific gear types, could greatly aid fisheries management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large marine protected areas might also provide refuges to offset the long-term environmental costs of damaging and non-selective gears [80].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite growing commitments to fostering sustainability in small-scale fisheries [10], remarkably, little research has evaluated long-term changes in small-scale fisheries [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our quantitative assessment of historical fishing practices targets this critical information gap and provides valuable advice for establishing sound methodologies to meet this goal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined that from 19502010, fisheries diversified, intensified, and increased in total fishing effort especially for intensive fishing gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The priorities of fisheries governance were evident in the strong uptake of active and non-selective fishing gears during the Productivity Era.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many other cases, however, the fingerprint of governance was largely absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through this research, we demonstrate the fundamental role of fisheries policies and growing human populations in influencing changes in fishing effort and gears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This grounded historical understanding can provide direction and targets for ongoing efforts to reduce the effects of overfishing [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#
