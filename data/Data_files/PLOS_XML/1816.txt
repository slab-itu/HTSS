A new giraffid (Mammalia, Ruminantia, Pecora) from the late Miocene of Spain, and the evolution of the sivathere-samothere lineage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Giraffids include the only living giraffomorph ruminants and are diagnosed by the presence of bi-lobed canines and a special type of epiphyseal cranial appendages called ossicones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The family Giraffidae ranges from the latest early Miocene until today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However they are currently extant relics with only two living representatives, the African genera Okapia and Giraffa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Giraffids were much more diverse and widespread in the past, with more than 30 fossil species described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the past decades a number of studies intended to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of the family, but due to the lack of really good cranial material no clear consensus was reached regarding the phylogenetic relationships amongst the different members of the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exceptionally complete remains of a new large giraffid from the late Miocene of Spain, Decennatherium rex sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., allows us to improve and reassess giraffid systematics, offering a lot of new data, both anatomic and phylogenetic, on the large late Miocene giraffids of Eurasia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of our cladistic analysis show Decennatherium as a basal offshoot of a clade containing the gigantic samotheres and sivatheres, characterized by the presence of a Sivatherium-like ossicone-plan among other features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decennatherium thus offers the most ancient evidence of this Sivatherium-plan and firmly establishes the early morphological patterns of evolution of a sivathere / samothere-clade that is defined as the less inclusive clade that contains Decennatherium and Sivatherium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, this large group of four-ossiconed giraffids evolutionarily links Miocene Europe and Africa indicating vicariance / migration processes among the giraffid genetic pools separated by the Mediterranean Sea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Giraffidae is a clade of crown-pecorans that include the only extant survivors of the ancient Giraffomorpha [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Giraffids are diagnosed by the presence of a bilobed canine and a special type of epiphyseal and permanent cranial appendage called ossicone [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ossicones are also present in palaeomerycids, thus they are found in at least two families within Giraffomorpha, the Palaeomerycoidea and the Giraffoidea [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sánchez et al [4] hypothesized ossicone-like appendages as a possible basal trait for Giraffomorpha, however this has to be still fully corroborated by both the fossil record and a deep analysis of the anatomy and structure of the diverse giraffomorph cranial appendages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Living giraffids are relics and represented by only two genera, the African Okapia [5] (monotypic) and Giraffa [6](could be four species) [7, 8], but it was very diverse during the Miocene, when it was widespread throughout the Old World.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The earliest remains of giraffids come from the early and middle Miocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are the basal forms Canthumeryx sirtensis [9] (= Zarafa zelteni) from the lower Miocene Gebel Zelten (Libya), Wadi Moghara (Egypt), Kalodirr, Loperot, Buluk, Moruorot and Rusinga Island (Kenya), and Yeroham (Israel) [2, 9, 10] as well as from the middle Miocene of Maboko Island (Kenya) and Al-Sarrar (Saudi Arabia) [2]; and the form Georgiomeryx georgalasi [11] from Thymiana (Greece) [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Giraffid remains from the middle Miocene are scarce, but giraffid remains become very abundant from late Miocene deposits onwards, showing a high diversity of shapes and forms, found all over Eurasia and Africa [1, 1315].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the late Miocene was a period of rapid diversification within the Giraffidae [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two late Miocene giraffids from the Iberian Peninsula are currently described, the Vallesian Decennatherium pachecoi (MN9-10) and the early Turolian Birgerbohlinia schaubi (MN11) [15, 17, 18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purported close relationship of these two genera was recently rejected through a phylogenetic analysis [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some nodes of the tree are poorly supported and major politomies remain unresolved [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is probably due to the plesiomorphic dentition and post-cranial skeleton of the Giraffidae, as well as its high morphological stability [10, 19], with the ossicones and metapodials as the most significant characters to analyze the variability within the Giraffidae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The late Miocene (Vallesian; MN10) site of Batallones-10 (Madrid Basin, Madrid province, Spain; Fig 1) yielded abundant fossils of several individuals of a large giraffid that include beautifully preserved cranial, dental and postcranial remains of several individuals representing almost all skeletal elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample includes several well-preserved skulls, making Batallones-10 one of the best collections of Miocene giraffids worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This material provides important new data for testing previous hypotheses about the phylogenetic relationships of Decennatherium to other large Miocene Eurasian giraffids [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we describe the new giraffid from Batallones-10 and test its phylogenetic position within the Giraffidae, its relationships with the other two forms found in Spain, and also on the relationship hypothesis between Decennatherium and the subfamily Sivatherinae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Locality_and_geological_setting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fossil site-complex of Cerro de los Batallones (Batallones butte) is located near the town of Torrejón de Velasco (Madrid province), between the Jarama River Valley and the Prados-Guatén Depression in the central area of the Cenozoic Madrid Basin [2024].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The butte towers in a zone of olive groves that extends near the town of Torrejón de Velasco (Madrid province, Spain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fossil sites were found during mining operations at the butte (19912008) for the extraction of sepiolite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fossil site-complex of Batallones comprises a system of nine, non-interconnected distinct sites located on the structural butte (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The butte constitutes of a near horizontal sedimentary sequence of three units, all of which were deposited in terrestrial environments during the early Vallesian (early late Miocene, ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fossil remains were accumulated in cavities formed in clay by a process of subsurface hydraulic erosion known as piping [2024].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We differentiate two types of fossil accumulations in some Batallones localities, according to their internal stratigraphy and taxonomic composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower level assemblages overwhelmingly dominated by carnivoran remains, while upper level assemblages mainly consist of fossils of mammalian herbivores [2024].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Batallones-10 (BAT10 hereafter), discovered in 2007, was the last fossil locality discovered in Cerro de los Batallones (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though all sites are Vallesian in age, there are slight differences in composition of micro- and macromammals among the different fossil deposits that were attributed to minor temporal differences, indicating that BAT10 is older than BAT1, BAT3 and BAT5 [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fossil assemblage of BAT10 is extraordinarily rich and totally different from the lower levels of BAT1 and BAT3 (the carnivore-traps).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from very large terrestrial tortoises, it is composed principally of mammalian macro-herbivores, mainly giraffids and small-sized hipparionine equids (from colts to fully grown individuals), and also proboscideans, rhinocerotids, moschids, medium-sized bovids and suids, as well as various micromammals, squamates and birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carnivoran remains are scarce [21, 22, 26] while giraffid fossils are very abundant, including the exceptional finding in 2013 of a complete articulated giraffe individual (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Material  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The description is based on the complete fossil sample from BAT10 publicly curated by the Paleobiology Department at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales-CSIC (Madrid, Spain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We list the extensive specimen numbers in S1 and S2 Tables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparative material of Decennatherium pachecoi [17] comprises the entire sample of fossils from Los Valles de Fuentidueña (MNCN-CSIC, Madrid, Spain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other Decennatherium pachecoi data includes the bibliography on the material of Nombrevilla, Relea, Pedrajas de San Esteban, Saldaña [17], Campisalabos[27], La Roma and Masia del Barbo [15, 17, 28, 29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparative crania and postcrania material of Birgerbohlinia schaubi [17] come from Piera (Torrent dels Traginers, Piera, MN11) and from Crevillente-2 (Crevillente, Alicante, MN11), and was curated by the Institut Català de Paleontologia (Sabadell, Spain) and the Museo de Geologia de la Universidad de Valencia (Burjasot, Spain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We collected data regarding the middle Miocene basal giraffid Injanatherium arabicum [30] from Al Jadidah (Saudi Arabia) from the casts at the MNCN-CSIC (Madrid, Spain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Other cranial and postcranial data were collected from material curated by the AMNH (New York, USA), the NHM (London, UK) and MNHN (Paris, France).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This includes the early Miocene Canthumeryx sirtensis [9] from Gebel Zelten (Libya).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also includes the middle Miocene Giraffokeryx punjabiensis [31], from Bhandar, Chinji, Hasnot, Kashmir, Nathot, Phadial and Ramnagar (Pakistan) and Chakrana (India), and Giraffokeryx primaevus from Fort Ternan (Kenya) [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the same collections we also collected data of the Greek-Iranian late Miocene giraffids, including Samotherium major [33], and Samotherium boissieri [34] from the early Turolian to late Pliocene of Samos (Greece); as well as Palaeotragus rouenii [35] from Pikermi (Greece); Bohlinia attica [36] from Pikermi, Thessaloniki and Samos (Greece) and Maragha, (Iran); Helladotherium duvernoyi [35] from Pikermi, Thessaloniki, Samos (Greece), and Cucuron (France); Alcicephalus neumayri from Maragha (Iran) [37], and Palaeotragus coelophrys from Maragha (Iran).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data of the Chinese Schansitherium tafeli [38] and Samotherium sinense [39] from the late Miocene and early Pliocene of Shansi (China) also were collected at the same collections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we studied the late Miocene giraffids of India and Pakistan Bramatherium perimense [40] from Perim Island (Yemen) and Bramatherium megacephalum [41], from Dhok Pathan (Pakistan) as well as the early Pleistocene Sivatherium giganteum [42], from the upper Siwaliks near Kalka, Kharian, Nahun, Nàhan, Pinjaur, Siswan, and Chandigarh (India); and the Plio-pleistocene Giraffa jumae [43] from Çalta (Turkey) and Rawe (Kenya), also curated in the collections mentioned above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected additional anatomical data of osteological material of the extant giraffids Giraffa camelopardalis[6] and Okapia johnstoni [5] from the collections of comparative anatomy of the MNCN-CSIC (Madrid, Spain) and the AMNH (New York, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The rest of the morphological and biometrical information in this paper was collected from several publications, including Canthumeryx sirtensis [9] (= Zarafa zelteni) from Gebel Zelten (Libya), Moruorot and Rusinga (Kenya)[9, 10]; Georgiomeryx georgalasi [11] from Thymiana (Greece) [12]; Giraffokeryx primaevus [32] (= Palaeotragus primaevus) from Fort Ternan (Kenya) [32], and Injanatherium hazimi [44] from Gebel Hamrim (Iraq) [44, 45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected bibliographic data on other Miocene and Pliocene giraffids including: Schansitherium tafeli [38] from Shansi (China) [33, 39, 46]; Alcicephalus neumayri [37], from Maragha (Iran) [37, 47, 48]; Samotherium major [33] from Samos (Greece) and Kemiklitepe (Turkey) [33, 49, 50]; Palaeotragus coelophrys [37], from Maragha (Iran) and Ravin de la Pluie (Greece) [33, 47, 51, 52]; Palaeotragus microdon [33] from Gansu and Shansi (China) [33] and Helladotherium duvernoyi [35] from Pikermi, Samos and Nikiti (Greece), Vozarci and Karaslari (Macedonia), Hadjidimovo and Kalimantsi (Bulgaria), Maragha (Iran) and Cucuron (France) [31, 35, 50, 5355].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also collected bibliographic data of the larger giraffids Sivatherium maurusium [56], from Koobi Fora (Kenya) and Laetoli (Tanzania) [57, 58], Sivatherium olduvaiense[59] from Olduvai and Garussi Korongo (Tanzania) [6062] and Sivatherium hendeyi [63] from Cape Province (South Africa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the more recent giraffids we include data of Giraffa jumae [43] from East Rudolf and Rawe (Kenya) and Olduvai (Tanzania) [64] and Giraffa stillei [61] (= Okapia stillei, Giraffa gracilis) from Laetoli (Tanzania)[61, 6466].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We mostly follow the measurements proposed by Quiralte [67] but we created new ones for elements that needed new measurements (Figures A-J in S1 Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All measurements are presented in the Supporting Information (S1, S2 and S3 Tables) in order to facilitate complete descriptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We took all measurements with digital calipers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nomenclature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For anatomical nomenclature of the cranial and postcranial skeleton we follow Barone [68], and for nomenclature of the dentition Azanza [69] and Sánchez and Morales[70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the vertebral nomenclature of Danowitz et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [68, 7173].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Phylogenetic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships within the Giraffidae has been historically difficult due to the lack of really complete cranial material and the high morphological stability of most of dental and postcranial elements, meaning that there is little change amomg taxa over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rios et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [15] performed a phylogenetic analysis of the Giraffidae that showed the first cladistic evidence of the relationship between Decennatherium and samotheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exceptional remains from BAT10 allow us to present here a more complete phylogenetic analysis with more morphological characters and the best-known giraffid species, with the inclusion of Decennatherium rex sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. adding very useful information to the morphological dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose the living cervid Capreolus capreolus [6] as the outgroup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ingroup is composed of the Miocene palaeomerycids Xenokeryx amidalae [4] and Ampelomeryx ginsburgi [74], plus the giraffids Afrikanokeryx leakeyi, Canthumeryx sirtensis, Georgiomeryx georgalasi, Injanatherium hazimi, Injanatherium arabicum, Giraffokeryx punjabiensis, Giraffokeryx primaevus, Bohlinia attica, Giraffa stillei, Giraffa jumae, Giraffa camelopardalis, Palaeotragus rouenii, Palaeotragus microdon, Palaeotragus coelophrys, Okapia johnstoni, Samotherium sinense, Schansitherium tafeli, Deccenatherium pachecoi, Decennatherium rex sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.

Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cranial_skeleton  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cranial remains (Fig 3) consist of four complete skulls and several maxillary fragments with part of the supraorbital area, the posterior appendage and part of the posterior skull attached, plus a number of unattached ossicones and hemimandibles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Skull  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the BAT10 sample there are four skulls, two complete (one of each morphotype), and two almost complete (Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In dorsal view the two supraorbital foramens are placed behind the anterior ossicones on the frontal bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occipital is wide and the superior occipital edge extends backwards and upwards, being much more prominent and extended than in Giraffa and Okapia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no development of the frontal sinus to hollow the ossicones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In lateral view the facial crest is deep.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lacrimal canal foramen is closed and the caudal lachrymal process is barely developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supraorbital canal orifices are rounded and wide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orbit is rounded with the zygomatic process of the frontal bone very developed and rugose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brow arch is very prominent above the orbit and the zygomatic arch is prominent under the orbit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ethmoidal fissure is open and the temporal fossa is deep and subrectangular.The masseteric is large, with  values that range from 6,275° to 8,15° (n = 2) and  values that range from 81,03° to 109,37° with an average of 98,25°(n = 4) (Fig 7) [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The premaxilla is very elongated and straight and the nasal bone is prominent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The premaxillar shape is intermediate between the pointy browser shape and the squarer grazer shape [83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mandibular symphysis and lower incisors are horizontal in relation to the basipalatal axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maxillar tuberosity is very developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ventral view the foramen magum is rounded and deep and the intercondylar groove is wide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The jugular process is more developed than in Okapia and less than in Giraffa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The retroarticular process expansion is not fused to the bullae, which are not very developed, being similar to those of Giraffa rather than the large bullae of Okapia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the sheath of the eardrum varies little relative to the bullae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The auditory meatus is rounded and oriented laterally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basioccipital muscular tubercules of the occipital are very prominent and rounded and are much more developed than in Giraffa and Okapia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The foramen ovale are rounded and deep, similar to those on Okapia rather than the more subtles ones of Giraffa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The palatine choane do not expand as anteriorly as in Giraffa, reaching only the posterior part of the M3, similarly to Okapia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grand palate foramina are located next to the M3 while in Okapia and Giraffa are next to the M1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mastoid is reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The skulls were extensively measured (S1 Table) and show variability, both metrical and morphological.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences appear to be related mainly to the difference in preservation states, as most suffer some degree of dorsoventral and mediolateral compression (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAT1008.G3-91, BAT1013.E2-69), mostly on the frontal and facial area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is also variability that actually reflects the intraspecific differences between the two morphotypes found in the Batallones sample as well as the ontogenetic development of this giraffid (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurement 20: skull with at the ossicone basis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mandible  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Most of the hemimandibles (n = 25) (Fig 8) correspond to adult individuals, with only 12% of the sample being juveniles in different states of development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One specimen corresponds to a specially young individual (according to [62] in extant giraffes BAT1009.F4-22 would not be older than 4 months).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In dorsal view the coronoid process is well developed and its uppermost part is laterally oriented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The condylar process is oval and extends medially (see Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the mandibular and the mentonian foramina are large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mandibular foramen appears in the caudoventral side of a very shallow pterygoid fossa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The masseteric fossa is slightly ventrocaudally expanded and its surface is slightly rugous except at the vascular incision where there is a more rugous and bulgy area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This configuration indicates that the deepest part of the masseteric muscle is more developed than the superficial part [84].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diastema is very elongated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are slight variations in the ramus width with some thinner specimens (BAT10 w/n, BAT10'10,F5-9) and others wider than the average (BAT10'13.D4-80).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Medially the surface for the medial pterygoid muscle is rough.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hyoid  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In ventral view the skull BAT1013.E2-69 shows a portion of the hyoid bone (Fig 3C), particularly a very elongated stylohyoideum portion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A slight curved portion of the epihyoideum can also be seen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Our data matrix (S1 File, S4 Table) includes 31 taxa and 111 characters (cranial, dental, mandibular, and postcranial; S2 Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Maximum Parsimony (MP) search produced a single Most Parsimonious Tree (MPT) of 274 steps (CI = 0.675; RI = 0.780; Fig 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bremer support for most of the branches is low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tree recovers a monophyletic Giraffidae, the most basal off-shoots of which are the stratigraphically older Canthumeryx sirtensis and Georgiomeryx georgalasi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining taxa are grouped into two clades: a group of stem-giraffids including Injanatherium hazimi, Injanatherium arabicum, Giraffokeryx punjabiensis and Giraffokeryx primaevus, and the large group of crown-giraffids (node D) in which the forms found in Spain Decennatherium pachecoi, Decennatherium rex (urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:68375E3F-6C6F-45F9-9F89-8B10D3608C6A) and Birgerbohlinia schaubi are included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crown-Giraffidae split into two groups, one of them containing Giraffa + Bohlinia attica (node E) and the other one (node F) including a Palaeotragus-clade (node H) basal to a large group (node I) that clusters Okapia johnstoni, Samotherium sinense and Schansitherium tafeli as successive sister groups to a Sivatherium / Samotherium-clade (node J, sivathere-clade hereafter) that is composed of Decennatherium, Birgerbohlinia, samotheres and sivatheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, Decennatherium, including D. rex + D. pachecoi (node K), branches off as the sister group of the clade that includes the late Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene Samotherium major, Samotherium boissieri, Alcicephalus neumayri, Birgerbohlinia schaubi, Sivatherium hendeyi, Helladotherium duvernoyi, Sivatherium maurusium/olduvaiense, Sivatherium giganteum, Bramatherium perimense and Bramatherium megacephalum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of character states for the internal nodes and the autapomorphies of the terminals are presented in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Node K includes Decennatherium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phylogenetic_position_of_Decennatherium_within_the_Giraffidae  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Giraffidae is the least inclusive clade of giraffomorphs containing Canthumeryx, Giraffa and Okapia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among giraffids, the Sivathere-clade (node J) is diagnosed in our MPTs by five synapomorphies (Table 1) that include mainly cranial features related to the ossicones, as the development of the ridges over the surface of the ossicone (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16) and the position of the anterior and posterior ossicones (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define the Sivatherium-clade as the least inclusive clade of crown-giraffids that contains Decennatherium and Sivatherium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our MPT shows a close relationship between samotheres and sivatheres, with Birgerbohlinia schaubi appearing as a basal branch of the derived Sivatherium + Bramatherium clade (node L), a strongly supported position (Fig 31) that agrees with previously published cladistic works [15] and is similar to the group described by Hamilton (1978) [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result confirms the close relationship of the Iberian giraffids to the African sivatheres, as previously proposed by Crusafont (1952) [17], Morales and Soria (1981) [89] and Montoya and Morales (1991) [90].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Iberian Decennatherium rex is the earliest example of the basic Sivatherium-like ossicone plan (Figs 35, 32 and 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This plan consists on a four-ossicone pattern with two small anteriorly-oriented frontal ossicones plus two much larger, caudally-oriented and curved, fronto-parietal ossicones covered by numerous longitudinal ridges (characters 147, Figs 35, 32 and 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birgerbohlinia schaubi shows larger versions of the Decennatherium rex ossicones, and the gigantic Sivatherium giganteum and S. maurisium/olduvaiense sport the most extreme versions of this plan (Figs 32 and 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basal to the Sivatherium-clade, Schansitherium tafeli also has four ossicones but contrary to the Sivatherium ossicone-plan its anterior ossicones are much larger and straight, and have their bases fused with the posterior ossicones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also the posterior ossicones of Schansitherium are straight instead of curved (Fig 33B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stem-giraffid Giraffokeryx punjabiensis from the Middle Miocene of India and Pakistan has posterior ossicones superficially similar to that of Decennatherium rex, but contrary to the Iberian form its anterior ossicones are postero-laterally oriented and slightly anteriorly placed (Fig 34C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a four-ossicone pattern of head gear has appeared more than once within the Giraffidae with at least four types of it, two of them characterizing forms outside the crown-Giraffidae (Inajanatherium and Giraffokeryx), a third one being apparently autapomorphic for Schansitherium, and finally the Sivatherium-plan itself, which became the most successful and long-lived one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into account the phylogenetic position of Schansitherium as the latest sister-group to the Sivatherium-clade it could be hypothesized the presence of four ossicones in Schansitherium + node J as a basal homology between the two clades that derived for the one part in the Schansitherium morphology and for the other part in the Sivatherium-plan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of ossicones with bumps in Decennatherium rex (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17) further connects Decennatherium to the Sivatherium lineage as this bumps are very similar to those observed in the ossicones of Sivatherium maurusium/olduvaiense (Fig 32Q32U) [62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The postcranial skeleton of Decennatherium rex is more primitive than that of true sivatheres (node L) more similar to that of the samotheres, especially to Alcicephalus neumayri (Fig 35L) [15, 33, 89].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A samothere-like postcranial is less robust than that of sivatheres, the metapodials of which reach really high robustness indexes (Figs 36 and 37, ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  94) [86].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, samothere (and Decennatherium) skeletal pattern is primitive compared to the derived pattern of sivatheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sivathere robustness goes together with a shortening of the limbs [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robustness and morphology of the limbs of Decennatherium rex are intermediate between that of the early Vallesian Decennatherium pachecoi and that of the Turolian Birgerbohlinia schaubi, a basal true sivathere in which the sivathere-like shortening and increased robusticity of the limbs can already be fully appreciated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next step is represented by the metapodials of the Plio-Pleistocene Sivatherium hendeyi, with Sivatherium giganteum and Sivatherium maurusium/olduvaiense showing the maximum example of this skeletal pattern (Fig 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Decennatherium rex and D. pachecoi are sister-taxa, with Decennatherium pachecoi stratigraphycally older.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with no skull elements that can be reliably attributed to D. pachecoi [15, 89] they share dental and postcranial morphological features (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  79 (1); ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  106(2)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both species can be differentiated by morphological differences in the p3 and also by the higher overall robustness of D. rex skeleton (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  78, ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8182, ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  99) (Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A Palaeotragus-clade (node H) appears as the sister group of the node I, in which the extant Okapia johnstoni branches-off as the most basal taxon (Fig 33A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palaeotragines are characterized by ossicones in a more medial position (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2021, 25) with a very smooth surface and pointy tips that may show apical polish (Fig 34F and 34G)[93], as well as a molarized p3 with a complete lingual wall (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  81).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies differ from ours [15], linking Okapia johnstoni to the Palaeotraginae as a basal offshoot of the Palaeotragus-clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in the phylogenetic position of Okapia between the different maximum parsimony analyses is due to the differences in the number of characters and taxa used in the analysis, and should therefore be regarded as working hypotheses that will benefit from further phylogenetic tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clade F (palaeotragines + node I) is diagnosed by the elongation of the diastema (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  70) and a derived masseteric morphology (ch.52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extant and extinct Giraffa (Figs 33D, 33E, 35P and 35Q) plus Bohlinia attica (Fig 35O), cluster together in the sister clade to the rest of the crown-Giraffidae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these giraffine species show a characteristic elongation of the cervical vertebrae (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  87) [1, 7173], an extreme limb elongation (Fig 38, ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  96) and a reduction of the robustness of the radius (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  92).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, what we see in the extant Biosphere is, according with our MPT, a single remnant from each of the two main lineages of the crown-Giraffidae (nodes H and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results agree with other recent studies [1, 15] in considering the depth of the longitudinal palmar hollowing of the metacarpals containing the palmar interosseous muscles and the specialized tendinous derivatives of these muscles as an important set of characters for understanding giraffid evolution (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9798, 102103, Fig 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can discriminate several groups of taxa with very shallow troughs (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Giraffa camelopardalis), very deep troughs (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bohlinia attica), and medium troughs (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decennatherium rex) (Fig 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solounias (2007) [1] linked Birgerbohlinia schaubi with Bohlinia attica according to their very deep troughs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our MPT this is recovered as a parallelism between these two taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our MPT the presence of very deep troughs links Birgerbohlinia schaubi to other species that also share this feature: Sivatherium hendeyi from Langebaanweg, (South Africa) [63] (Soria pers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  com.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), Helladotherium duvernoyi from Pikermi (Greece) and Cucuron (France), and Bramatherium megacephalum from Dhok Pathan (Pakistan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The late Miocene was a time of extensive giraffid diversification, and representatives of this family are found in numerous late Miocene localities throughout all Eurasia and Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some localities have at least eight different species appearing in a single site as is the case of Samos (Greece), were several giraffids coexisted with many bovids and other ungulates [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Iberian Peninsula (Fig 40) the first record of the family is the early Vallesian Decennatherium pachecoi [15, 17, 89], chronostratigraphycally followed by the late Vallesian Decennatherium rex and the Turolian Birgerbohlinia schaubi [28, 90].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The youngest records of the Sivathere-clade are the Plio-Pleistocene Sivatherium hendeyi from Langebaanweg (South Africa) [63], the Plio-Pleistocene Sivatherium olduvaiense/maurusium from Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia, and the Pleistocene Sivatherium giganteum from the Siwalik Hills (India and Pakistan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recovery of Decennatherium as the most basal member of this clade extends its paleobiogeographic range to the Iberian Peninsula, and its chronostratigraphical range to the beginning of the late Miocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recovery of Decennatherium in the Iberian Peninsula also points to the existence of migration / vicariance events of sivathere / samothere genetic pools between the northern and southern margins of the Mediterranean Sea that probably took place even before the beginning of the late Miocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sexual_dimorphism_of_the_cranial_appendages_of_Decennatherium_rex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are six calvaria of Decennatherium rex, all with ossicones, in the BAT10 sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of them are morphotype I and the other three are morphotype II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar states of dental wear do not correlate to ossicone morphotype, excluding ontogeny as the factor behind ossicone development and morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that each morphotype represents a different gender in Decennatherium rex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, following the trend of putative smaller, lesser-developed female ossicones, morphotype I skulls correspond to female individuals and morphotype II correspond to males (Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sexual dimorphism of ossicones in the extinct Giraffoidea is typically difficult to identify since isolated ossicones, frontlets bearing more or less complete ossicones, and the occasional nearly complete skull usually do not indicate the sex of the individual [9499].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, among living Giraffidae, cranial appendages of female Giraffa are smaller than those of the males (Fig 34E).Thus, Decennatherium rex would be similar to extant Giraffa in the gender-related pattern of development of the cranial appendages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are probably more examples of Giraffa-like dimorphism in the Sivatherium-clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Harris [63] pointed that the recovery of gracile ossicones of Sivatherium spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  may indicate that some females may have carried cranial ornamentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Singer and Boné [62] stated that sexual dimorphism exists in the ossicones of Sivatherium spp., with males possessing the larger and more twisted or complex head gear and females sporting lighter and simpler ossicones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Churcher [94] stated that it is likely that cranial ornaments were present in both sexes of primitive giraffids, and may have served in specific recognition or temperature regulation when originally developed with their use in intraspecific male sparring or combat developing later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into account the phylogenetic structure of the Giraffoidea [1] it seems plausible to think that having armed females could be the primitive condition for this lineage of giraffomorphs, but this has to be more thoroughly studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dietary_adaptations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following Solounias [1] we have analyzed the shape and size of the masseteric fossa (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5253), the shape of the premaxillae, and other cranial and masticatory features related to feeding behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall grazers have a larger masseteric fossa than browsers [84, 100], and most giraffid species have angles that are similar to those of a mixed feeder / browsing bovid [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest masseteric fossae recorded were those of Samotherium major and Samotherium sinense, were the skull resembles Alcelaphini grazers in lateral view [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decennatherium rex has  values (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52) that range from 6,275° to 10,76° (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fall within the middle range of the analyzed giraffids, in the same category as Schansitherium tafeli, Palaeotragus microdon and Samotherium boissieri [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only Samotherium major shows values over 10°, while Canthumeryx sirtensis, Okapia johnstoni and Giraffa camelopardalis show low angle  values (5°).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding  values (ch.53) Decennatherium rex ranges from 74,175° to 109,37° (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are close to those of S. tafeli (89,38°-92,27°) and S. major (95,49°-95,83°) while the values of the rest of giraffids in our analysis were lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that Decennatherium rex has a relatively larger masseteric fossa than most giraffids and may indicate more grazing habits for this species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decennatherium rex also shows other grazer masticatory features such as an enlarged maxilla and a large masseter profundus muscle attachment site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, in grazers this enlarged maxilla tends to move the orbit posteriorly, starting above the M3 position or further back as in Decennatherium rex [84].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However the shape of the premaxillae in Decennatehrium rex (Figs 3 and 4) is intermediate between the pointy browser shape of Palaeotragus coelophrys and the square grazer shape of Samotherium major [83, 93].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research on fossil giraffid paleodiet using three independent methods including both tooth microwear and premaxillary analysis [100] concluded that Bramatherium megacephalum, Sivatherium giganteum and Samotherium major were grazers while Giraffokeryx punjabiensis, Palaeotragus spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Samotherium boissieri were seasonal mixed feeders, with Alcicephalus neumayri characterized as a seasonal mixed feeder and Giraffokeryx primaevus, Bohlinia attica, Giraffa camelopardalis, Okapia johnstoni and Helladotherium duvernoyi as browsers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work suggested that there is a high dietary heterogeneity among the Giraffidae [100] and that the traditional characterization of giraffids as browsers needs to be re-evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other works using outer and inner mesowear analysis [101] resulted in most giraffids characterized as having a browsing and mixed feeding diet along the north Chinese and Greek localities of the Pikermian biome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Domingo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [102] analyzed the isotopic composition of the enamel of Birgerbohlinia schaubi from Puente Minero (MN11) and the results suggested that Birgerbohlinia schaubi was likely a browser with 13C values indicative of woodland foraging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The very high 18OCO3 and 18OPO4 values in Birgerbohlinia schaubi relative to other mammals from Puente Minero may indicate that this sivatheriine obtained much of its water from highly evaporated leave water as suggested by Cerling et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [103] for the extinct Palaeotragus and Levin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [102, 104] for modern giraffids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, data suggest that while most primitive giraffid species were browsers and that grazing and mixed feeding took place in forest and woodlands during the Miocene before the expansion of savannas and grasslands [1], late Miocene giraffids had a wider range of dietary habits than the living Giraffa spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Okapia johnstoni [101].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, further microwear, mesowear and isotopic analysis would be needed to establish the condition of Decennatherium rex as a grazer or a mixed feeder more accurately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Body_mass  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Estimates of body size are important biological descriptors, as they indicate important traits as growth rates, metabolism and behavior [105, 106].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate a height to the cross of ~2 meters and ~2,8 m to the top of the ossicones, and a length of 2,9 m to the front of the premaxilla to the back of the pelvis (Fig 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We follow Campione et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [105] and use the minimum circumference (thinnest region along the diaphysis) of the humerus and femur to estimate the body mass of Decennatherium rex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results ranged from 776,666 1 to 1367,1190 Kg (Table 2), very similar to the weight of an adult Giraffa and heavier than an adult Okapia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The extraordinary collection of giraffid fossils from the late Miocene site of BAT10 (Madrid, Spain) allow us to describe the new species Decennatherium rex and carry out a phylogenetic analysis of the Giraffidae using the largest morphological data matrix ever compiled for this ruminant clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skull anatomy of Decennatherium was unknown so far, and through the description of its skeleton, Decennatherium rex sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. helps to reassess the morphological evolution and phylogenetic relationships of both the genus Decennatherium and the clade of girafids in which it belongs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While several works linked Decennatherium to samotheres, our study reveals a more complex image where this Iberian genus appears as the basal off-shoot of a large sivathere-clade (also including samotheres).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This group is diagnosed mainly by cranial features, and is defined as the least inclusive clade of crown-giraffids that contains Decennatherium and Sivatherium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inclusion of Decennatherium as the most basal branch of this clade extends the chronostratigraphic and paleobiogeographic ranges of sivatheres / samotheres to the early late Miocene and to the Iberian Peninsula in Europe, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence the Sivathere-clade is one of the most successful and long-lived of all the Giraffidae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, Decennatherium is the earliest known evidence of the Sivatherium ossicone-plan, a pattern of four ossicones that consists of two small, anteriorly-oriented, frontal ossicones and two much larger, caudally-oriented and curved, fronto-parietal ossicones that are covered by numerous longitudinal ridges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through Decennatherium this plan can be traced back to the late Miocene in Western Europe, disappearing with the last gigantic sivatheres at the end of the Pleistocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This large cranial headgear would be of high relevance in establishing and maintaining the dominance of the members of this clade from the Miocene to almost the verge of present times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Decennatherium rex was probably sexually dimorphic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females were horned, but their ossicones were smaller and lesser developed than those of males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, D. rex was similar to extant Giraffa and different from Okapia, the females of which are hornless.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The premaxilla shape of Decennatherium rex is intermediate between a pointy browser shape and a full square grazer morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other characters (size of masseteric fossa and caudal displacement of the orbit) also point to mixed-feeding habits in D. rex, as was probably common among Miocene giraffids, which had a wider range of feeding strategies than those present in extant Giraffa and Okapia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microwear, mesowear, and isotopic analyses will potentially help refine this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The estimated body mass for Decennatherium rex (slightly less than 1000 Kg) indicates that this giraffid was smaller than the extant Giraffa, but still was considerably larger than Okapia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also indicates a size increase from the most basal members of the Sivathere-clade to the gigantic and derived Plio-Pleistocene representatives of the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
