The negative results of the BENEFIT trial are a potential setback for the more than 1 million people now living with Chagasic cardiomyopathy, and at least one in six will die from their disease in the next five years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, millions more are living with Chagas disease in the acute and indeterminate stages of their disease, but most of them are unaware of their condition while being denied access to diagnosis and treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BENEFIT trial is a clarion call for the international community to now aggressively step up efforts to increase diagnosis, treatment, and R&D for Chagas disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
