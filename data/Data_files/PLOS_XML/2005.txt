Design of synthetic bacterial communities for predictable plant phenotypes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specific members of complex microbiota can influence host phenotypes, depending on both the abiotic environment and the presence of other microorganisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is challenging to define bacterial combinations that have predictable host phenotypic outputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that plantbacterium binary-association assays inform the design of small synthetic communities with predictable phenotypes in the host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we constructed synthetic communities that modified phosphate accumulation in the shoot and induced phosphate starvationresponsive genes in a predictable fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that bacterial colonization of the plant is not a predictor of the plant phenotypes we analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrated that characterizing a subset of all possible bacterial synthetic communities is sufficient to predict the outcome of untested bacterial consortia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that it is possible to infer causal relationships between microbiota membership and host phenotypes and to use these inferences to rationally design novel communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Symbiotic microbes influence host development and health, but predicting which microbes or groups of microbes will have a helpful or harmful effect is a major challenge in microbiome research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this article, we describe a new method to design and predict bacterial communities that alter the plant host response to phosphate starvation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method uses plantbacterium binary-association assays to define groups of bacteria that elicit similar effects on the host plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By constructing partially overlapping bacterial communities, we demonstrated that it is possible to modify phosphate accumulation in the plant shoot and the induction of plant phosphate starvation genes in a controlled manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that bacterial colonization of the plant root does not predict the capacity to produce this phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the predictive performance of different statistical models and identified one best able to predict the behavior of untested communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work demonstrates that studying a subset of all possible bacterial communities is sufficient to anticipate the outcome of novel bacterial combinations, and we establish that it is possible to deduce causality between microbiome composition and host phenotypes in complex systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The composition of plant-associated microbial communities influences plant health and development [1][2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has raised interest in the use of microbes for biotechnology and agriculture [3][4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is challenging to measure the contribution of individual microbes from a complex microbiota to host health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a number of in vitro screening strategies are commonly applied to identify candidate plant-interacting microbes; however, none of the traits typically screened are correlated with a plant-beneficial outcome [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another common prescreening strategy involves performing plantbacterium binary-association assays [6], but only a few have been successfully translated into agricultural settings [7][8][9], suggesting that these assays also fail to capture critical aspects of natures complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it is well established that microbial consortia can produce strong and unexpected effects on host health [10][11], and such emergent properties are hard to predict, hindering the rational design of microbial consortia with desired host outputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous strategies to address this conceptual problem included the exhaustive study of possible communities assembled from a small number of microbiota constituents in zebrafish [12] and the analysis of randomized combinations of bacteria in mice [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other approaches often begin with an exhaustive evaluation of all combinations of, for example, the nutrients nitrate and ammonium and the hormones auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid on plant root growth and development [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although exhaustive approaches can provide a complete picture of interactions within complex systems, they are unfeasible for systems with more than a handful of variables, given the astronomical number of possible factorial combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in the rare cases in which functional microbial consortia have been assembled, most studies focus on a single community that is considered a treatment, and rarely is an effort made to dissect the contribution of its constituents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes it impossible to establish predictable generalizations beyond the tested communities or conditions used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An instance that dissected the components of a consortium consisted of only 2 bacterial strains [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings reinforce the necessity for reduced complexity and modular model systems to associate microbial community composition with host phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our approach is summarized in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, we first characterized the relationship between in vitro bacterial assays and plantbacterium binary-association assays, and we used the latter to define functional bacterial blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These blocks are groups of bacteria that, by themselves, have a similar influence on a host phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we defined a subset of all the possible communities by constructing partially overlapping synthetic communities (SynComs) of 2 blocks each, tested the effect of these consortia on multiple plant phenotypes, and characterized the plant transcriptional response to these consortia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the predictive performance of different statistical models on communities that the models had not seen before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected a neural network (NN) because it maximized predictive performance and used this model to design novel synthetic communities that maximized the change in 1 plant phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we tested the model designs by constructing the novel communities it suggested and validated nearly all of the predicted host phenotypic outputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We focus on bacterial manipulation of the plant response to phosphate (Pi) starvation, a commonly limiting nutrient for plant growth [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pi is an essential macronutrient for plants and also for microbes [17][18] and is limited in soil [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbial communities living in the proximity of the plant take up Pi from the environment using a highly efficient Pi transport system [20][21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the available Pi in the close vicinity of plants is subject to direct and intense competition for uptake between microbes and plants [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the response of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings in axenic conditions to phosphate starvation is well characterized [22], the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of this response in the presence of the plant microbiome is only recently emerging [23] [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We systematically evaluated the performance of a large collection of root bacterial isolates using in vitro screening and binary plantbacterium association assays as predictors for the effect of derived bacterial consortia on plant phenotypes in response to phosphate starvation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirm that bacterial in vitro assays have no correlation with bacterial effects on plant phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that plantbacterium binary-association assays are informative for designing small synthetic communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the effects of bacterial consortia on host physiology were mostly additive and independent of bacterial abundances, suggesting that functional stacking within a microbial consortium can determine its effect on host phenotypic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we successfully validated novel synthetic communities designed by an NN that led to predictable changes in plant shoot Pi content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide a useful road map from binary hostmicrobe assays to the design and testing of useful small consortia to predictably alter host phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In response to Pi deficiency, plants change root exudate metabolite profiles and root architecture to explore Pi-rich soil patches [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may lead to bacterial soil community shifts [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to learn how root exudate profiles change in response to Pi, we harvested root exudates from A. thaliana plants in response to 2 short and complementary nutritional transitions that mimic the dynamics of Pi stress [27] (S1A Fig; Materials and methods 1a, 1b, 1d, 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that our Pi transitions were sufficient to induce a reconfiguration of plant exudate primary metabolic profiles (S1C and S1D Fig, and S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next tested whether these exudates modified the in vitro growth capacity of a collection of 440 bacterial strains isolated from the roots of Brassicaceae grown in soil that is not overtly Pi deficient (nearly all from A. thaliana) ([28], S1B Fig, and Materials and methods 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a range of bacterial growth behaviors (Materials and methods 1f, 1g) and found that the bacterial growth differences between phosphate conditions are much weaker than the differences between strains (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, phylogeny explained most of the growth differences between strains (S2A Fig and Materials and methods 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the bacterial growth parameters provided the same information, so we selected the area under the growth curve (optical density [OD] versus time) (AUC) as a growth marker for subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hierarchical clustering of AUC differences between in vitro conditions identified 10 groups of bacteria that represented different response patterns to exudates derived from roots grown in different Pi concentrations and media supplemented or not with Pi (S2B Fig and S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that root exudates could enhance or inhibit bacterial growth and that this effect could be either general or specific to one type of exudate (S2B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, consistent with previous findings [26], plant-derived root exudates modulated the growth of bacterial root isolates depending on the plants Pi starvation status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We selected a subset (n = 183) of the strains from the in vitro assays for determining whether they exerted a functional role on the plant under different phosphate conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected bacterial isolates that belonged to all of the different response patterns (S2B Fig) and that were most responsive to both Pi levels and the presence of exudates (Materials and methods 1g, S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the change in plant shoot Pi content, a direct marker of phosphate starvation responsiveness [22], in response to the presence of each of 183 individual strains, when compared to axenically grown plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated shoot Pi content under 4 Pi conditions that represented a 2 × 2 design matrix of 2 Pi levels used for plant germination (full; 1 mM; and depleted, about 5 M Pi) and 2 Pi concentrations (30 M Pi and 100 M Pi) to which seedlings were switched, concomitant with the application of each bacterial strain (Fig 2A and Materials and methods 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of 2 germination conditions in the experimental design allowed us to evaluate the effect of the activation of the phosphate starvation response and the shoot Pi content on the plantbacterium interaction under different Pi concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(A) Schematic representation of the pipeline used for the binary-association analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For binary-association experiments, plants were germinated in axenic condition on Johnson medium, 0.5% sucrose with either 1 mM Pi (+Pi), approximately 5 M Pi [traces of Pi from the agar] (Pi), or 1 mM phosphite (Phi; not shown) in a vertical position for 6 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seedlings were then transferred to 30 M Pi and 100 M Pi media (without sucrose), alone or with each bacterial strain, for another 7 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in a growth chamber in a 16-hour light/8-hour dark regime (24°C/21°C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Top: Distribution of shoot Pi content in plants cocultured with individual bacterial strains (+ Bacteria) or in axenic conditions (No Bacteria) across a 2 × 2 matrix of Pi levels used for plant germination [+Pi (1 mM Pi) and Pi (about 5 M Pi)] and 2 Pi concentrations (30 M Pi and 100 M Pi), to which seedlings were transferred concomitant with application of each bacterial strain (Materials and methods 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bottom: Number of strains that significantly increase or reduce the shoot Pi accumulation compared with no bacteria, after correction for multiple testing (Materials and methods 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asterisks indicate an enrichment of strains with an effect greater than expected (hypergeometric test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria (n = 183) and 3 replicas (10 plants each) were analyzed per strain in 2 independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See also S3 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Heat map of log(fold-change) in shoot Pi concentration between plants inoculated with individual bacterial strains, compared with axenically grown seedlings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatments are as in (B) and bacteria are sorted according to their phylogeny, as indicated by the tree on the left.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bottom bar plot shows the p-value from Pagels  test for phylogenetic signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 177/183 strains that were both tested in the plantbacterium interaction assays and had a high-quality full-length 16S sequence are included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Colonization capacity of 6 bacterial strains selected according to their performance in binary-association assays: 3 strains increased (green arrows) and another 3 decreased (red arrows) the shoot Pi content (see S3E Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CL and MF refer to the natural soils from which the strains were isolated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this experiment, we used plants germinated with (black block) or without (no block) Pi or in the presence of phosphite (black block).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plant tissue was crushed; serially diluted, plated, and c.f.us per gram of original material were determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data points are colored by bacterial strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Letters at the top of each panel denote statistical significance of Tukeys post hoc analysis of a linear model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerical values that underlie the data displayed in the panel are in https://github.com/surh/wheelP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  c.f.u, colony-forming unit; FW, fresh weight; Phi, phosphite; Pi, phosphate; 16S, ribosomal gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

On average, bacteria had a slightly negative effect on plant shoot Pi content, visualized as a small tail in the bacterial treatment graphs (pink) in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was stronger when the environmental Pi concentration was lower (Fig 2B and 2C and S3 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with our previous results that a bacterial synthetic community drives a context-dependent competition with the plant for Pi [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we found that more strains had a negative than a positive effect on shoot Pi content (Fig 2B, S3 Table, and Materials and methods 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, there were significantly more strains that had a stronger negative effect on plant shoot Pi content in the most limiting Pi conditions (germination in Pi depleted, followed by transfer to 30 M Pi) (Fig 2B and S3 Table), in which the phosphate starvation response should be active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the least Pi-deprived condition (germination in full Pi, followed by transfer to 100 M Pi) exhibited a significant enrichment of strains that positively affected shoot Pi content (Fig 2B and S3 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with bacterial effects on Pi content in the shoot being modulated by the nutritional status of the plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, germination conditions did not alter bacterial colonization (Fig 2D), and the effect of individual strains on plant shoot Pi content was independent of the ability of root-inoculated bacteria to colonize the shoot and independent of bacterial titers in different plant organs (Fig 2D; S3A Fig and Materials and methods 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We detected a weak phylogenetic signal in the ability of bacterial strains to modulate plant Pi content that was significant in only 2 of the 4 conditions (Fig 2C and Materials and methods 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we found no correlation between the effect of individual bacterial isolates on shoot Pi content and their in vitro growth phenotype in response to switched Pi levels and root exudates (S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our survey of plantbacteria binary associations and the resulting distribution of bacterial effects on shoot Pi content argue that the majority of plantbacteria interactions are competitive, at least in the context of phosphate starvation response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We recently demonstrated that the A. thaliana phosphate starvation response is largely antagonistic to immune system function [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore asked whether activation of the plant phosphate starvation response could modulate the outcome of binary bacteriaplant interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed shoot Pi content in plants pretreated with phosphite (Phi) (KH2PO3) and then transferred to either 30 M Pi or 100 M Pi in the presence of each of 30 selected bacterial strains that either reduced, increased, or had no effect on the shoot Pi content (10 strains per class; S3E Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phi is a nonmetabolizable analog of Pi and its accumulation delays the phosphate starvation response, resulting in low accumulation of Pi in the shoot [29](S3B and S3C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that germinating plants on Phi (low shoot Pi, phosphate starvation response off) dramatically reduced the number of bacterial isolates that diminished shoot Pi content, compared to germination on low Pi (low shoot Pi, phosphate starvation response on) (S3D and S3E Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we observed that under Phi pretreatment, none of the strains significantly increased shoot Pi content compared to germination on high Pi (high shoot Pi, phosphate starvation response off) (S3D and S3E Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, Phi treatment did not alter bacterial colonization (Fig 2D, S3A Fig and Materials and methods 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that activation of the plant phosphate starvation response results in different modes of bacterial interactions with the plant that are independent of shoot phosphate content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that an active phosphate starvation response can modulate the outcome of both positive and negative interactions with bacteria, likely mediated via coregulation of the plant immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analogous mechanism has been described for the interaction between A. thaliana and a beneficial fungus [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We sought to establish whether the results from binary associations are indicative of bacterial effects when a more complex bacterial community is present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a microcosm reconstitution approach, in which we inoculated plants with defined complex bacterial synthetic communities (Materials and methods 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of 78 strains analyzed in the binary-association experiments was grouped into 3 functional groups consisting of positive (P1-P3), indifferent (I1-I3), and negative (N1-N3) bacteria, depending on their effect on shoot Pi accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the positive and negative groups, we focused on strains that had a statistically significant effect on plant Pi accumulation, after correcting for multiple testing (Materials and methods 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each functional group was further divided into another 3 blocks of 89 bacterial strains, according to the magnitude of their individual effects (Fig 3A, S3 and S4 Tables, and Materials and methods 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then combined pairs of these blocks to define 14 partially overlapping bacterial synthetic communities (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scheme was designed to maximize the probability of observing extreme plant phenotypes by stacking functionally similar blocks and to gain information from combining the most extreme phenotypic blocks defined in the binary-association assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(A) Heat map showing strains (n = 78) tested in binary association and that were selected because they cause positive (P), negative (N), or indifferent (I) effects on shoot Pi content in the growth conditions defined in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strains are sorted within each group according to their mean effect on shoot Pi accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Color scale shows log(fold-change) of shoot Pi content with respect to axenically grown plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bars and labels at the bottom show the 9 bacterial blocks used for the design of synthetic communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Log(fold-change) is calculated from 6 pools of 10 plants in 2 independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See also S3 and S4 Tables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Schematic representation of the synthetic communities designed using pairs of blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections in the circle are the 9 bacterial blocks from (A); black curved segments represent synthetic communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outer curved segments and curves inside the circle represent synthetic communities made of adjacent and nonadjacent bacterial blocks, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Heat map shows the scaled effect of each synthetic community on 4 plant phenotypes: Pi content (Pi), primary root elongation (Main), shoot area (Area) and total root network (Net) across the 4 growth conditions defined in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Similar to (C) for individual bacterial functional blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both (C) and (D), the values correspond to the scaled coefficients from a linear model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values have been scaled through dividing by the standard deviation of all coefficients for the same phenotype and condition (each column in the plots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, 0 (white) represents no change with respect to axenically grown plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method to estimate the block and synthetic community effects are described in Materials and methods section 3j, and statistical significance (p-value less_than 0.05) is indicated with an X inside each tile, while the results of testing for significance for changes in Pi content are presented in S5 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Area, shoot area; Pi, phosphate; SynCom; synthetic community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We evaluated shoot Pi content, primary root elongation, shoot size, and total root network in A. thaliana plants grown in association with the 14 bacterial synthetic communities in the same growth conditions used for the binary-association analysis (Fig 2A and Materials and methods 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that synthetic communities, like individual bacterial strains, were more likely to reduce plant shoot Pi content, and that synthetic communities made of negative blocks led to lower shoot Pi accumulation than those composed of positive blocks (Fig 3C and 3D and S5 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in general, the estimated negative effect on shoot Pi accumulation for negative blocks is significantly larger than for positive or indifferent blocks (Fig 3C and 3D, S5a Table, and Materials and methods 3j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the synthetic community level, the effect of the negative strains was clearly dominant; only 2 communities containing negative blocks (I3N1 and N2N3) showed a nonsignificant reduction in shoot Pi content and this in only 1 of the tested conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the only significantly positive effect with respect to no bacteria involved 2 positive blocks and was weak (P1P3) (Fig 3C, S5b Table, and Materials and methods 3j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that the majority of the cases in which a synthetic community did not significantly reduce the shoot Pi accumulation occurred under the less Pi-restricted condition (100 M) (Fig 3C, S5b Table, and Materials and methods 3j), consistent with the results from the individual strains (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trend was generally consistent for the other plant phenotypes analyzed (Fig 3C and 3D and S5 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the reduction in shoot Pi content associated with negative blocks correlated with less shoot area, shorter primary roots, and bigger root networks (top and bottom rows in Fig 3C and 3D, and S5 Fig), morphological changes that match the canonical phosphate starvation response in axenic conditions [22][30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, positive bacterial blocks caused less intense plant phosphate starvation response phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects were more obvious in plants grown at low environmental Pi concentration (Fig 3C and 3D and S5 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the binary-association assays were generally informative with regard to the behavior of bacteria in more complex biotic backgrounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, we observed that a number of synthetic communities, for example P2P3 and P1P2, led to increased shoot area compared to axenically grown plants, despite exhibiting reduced shoot Pi content (Fig 3C and S5 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, plants treated with P1P3 in +Pi_100 M Pi condition, had shoot Pi content similar to Pi-sufficient plants but unexpectedly exhibited a reduced shoot area (Fig 3C and S5 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, bacterial consortia can decouple shoot Pi-content accumulation from the growth inhibition responses typically associated with the canonical phosphate starvation response [22][30][31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated the common (additive) effects of each block of strains across different bacterial backgrounds (e.g., in different synthetic communities) (Materials and methods 3j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, we found that additive contributions of the bacterial functional blocks are sufficient to explain most of the plant phenotypic variation observed (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that synthetic community membership (i.e., ignoring bacterial relative abundances) typically explained more than 50% of the plant phenotypic variance (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that intrablock bacterial interactions contribute at least as much as interblock interactions to the plant phenotypes tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the effect of bacterial blocks on the phenotypes analyzed is generally consistent across different synthetic communities, despite each strains relative abundance being dependent on the microbial context (S6 and S7 Figs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additive contributions of bacterial blocks explain synthetic community effects on all plant phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons between measured changes (x-axis) in plant phenotypes caused by synthetic communities, with respect to axenically grown plants, and expected changes (y-axis) from purely additive effects of each block, while ignoring bacterial relative abundances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each plot, the 4 panels represent the 4 media conditions tested, with germination conditions as rows and Pi treatment as columns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each point represents a synthetic community (n = 14); the x-axis corresponds to the color scale in Fig 3C, and the y-axis shows the result from adding the individual main effects estimated for each block (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standard error from both the measured and estimated change is shown for each point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blue line represents the least squares regression on the points from each panel, and the grey shade indicates the 95% confidence interval on the regression line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R2 is shown on each panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all axes, 0 represents no change with respect to axenically grown plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values for Pi content and shoot area are indicated as log(fold-change) with respect to axenically grown plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values for primary root elongation and total root network represent the difference with respect to axenically grown plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additivity is evidenced by agreement between predicted and measured phenotypic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerical values that underlie the data displayed in the panels are in https://github.com/surh/wheelP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pi, phosphate; R2, coefficient of determination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003962.g004  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the bacterial abundances in either agar substrate or in the root endophytic compartment were poorly correlated with plant phenotypes (Materials and methods 3e, 3k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the consistent taxonomic profiles of the inoculum, we observed that bacterial communities of agar and root samples were dominated by variable bacterial taxa, depending on the specific combination of bacterial blocks present (S6A and S6B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that bacteriabacteria interactions are important in shaping the final community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found clear taxonomic differences between root and agar samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most notably, Streptomyces strains (order Actinomycetales) were particularly good root colonizers despite their limited success on agar, while Pseudomonadales strains were relatively more successful in agar than in root samples (S6A and S6B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results recapitulate previous findings in natural soils, indicating that Actinobacteria are enriched in A. thaliana roots [32][33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphate concentrations in the media had only a minimal effect on the final community composition (S6B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then quantified the information gained by incorporating relative abundance data (S6 Fig) into our additive model (Materials and methods 3k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, in all cases (16/16) the plant phenotypic variance explained by microbiota composition decreased when we incorporated relative abundance (S7 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While in some cases, the differences might not be statistically significant, together, this result demonstrates significantly better performance by the model that ignores relative abundance (p-value = 0.000481; 2-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that bacterial blocks disproportionately modulate shoot Pi content with respect to their strain abundances, an observation analogous to that seen in bacteria modulating zebrafish immune responses [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The synthetic communities differentially modulated plant phenotypes related to phosphate starvation response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we examined the transcriptomes of plants growing with different synthetic communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first explored the expression of a literature-based core set of 193 phosphate starvation response transcriptional markers [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants did not exhibit induction of phosphate starvation response markers in axenic conditions, even when Pi was low (Fig 5A) [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some synthetic communities induced the canonical transcriptional response to Pi starvation in plants grown on 30 M Pi (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants that showed transcriptional activation of the phosphate starvation response displayed lower shoot Pi accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also observed that some synthetic community treatments lead to low shoot Pi content and no activation of the transcriptional phosphate starvation response (S8 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of synthetic communities was in general dependent on the presence of negative bacterial strain blocks (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, synthetic communities consisting of only positive blocks of bacteria did not induce the phosphate starvation response transcriptional signature in any condition analyzed (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No induction of the phosphate starvation response genes was observed when the Pi stress was released (following transfer to 100 M Pi) except for the bacterial combination P3N3, which exhibited induction on 100 M Pi (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with the shoot Pi content data (Figs 3C, 3D and 4), we found that additive effects of bacterial blocks could explain the level of transcriptional induction (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specificity in the bacterial modulation of plant phenotypes suggests that the changes observed in the plant in response to the synthetic communities are linked to bacterial block activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003962.g005  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next explored the overall plant genome-wide transcriptional response to bacteria consortia, Pi conditions, or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our design allowed us to test both the response to synthetic communities and to individual bacterial blocks between and within conditions (Materials and methods 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As anticipated, plants growing with bacterial synthetic communities on low Pi generally induced phosphate starvation responsive genes and modified the expression of immune systemrelated genes (S9 Fig, S6 and S7 Tables) [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, there was not a common response to bacterial presence, with only 45 and 35 genes being significantly up- or down-regulated by more than half of the bacterial blocks, respectively (S6 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of genes differentially expressed in response to different bacterial blocks did not correspond with the strain composition of the blocks; blocks P2, N3, and I1 altered the expression of the most genes, and blocks I3, N1, and P3 influenced the least (S6 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, block I3 only altered the expression of 17 genes, despite being detected in plant roots and surrounding agar (S6 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the functional level, most of the bacterial blocks induced the expression of the plant defense response, specifically up-regulating genes for salicylic acid biosynthesis (S10 Fig), consistent with overall Bacteria versus No Bacteria comparisons (S9C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also investigated differences between the genes induced by different bacterial blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of genes differentially expressed between positive and negative blocks across all conditions showed that positive blocks had higher expression of genes involved in energy production, while negative blocks specifically induced abiotic stressresponsive gene sets, specifically abscisic acidrelated genes (Fig 6A, S6 and S7 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative blocks of bacteria also increased the expression of a specific sector of the jasmonic acid response involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis (Fig 6A6C, S6 and S7 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The glucosinolate pathway modulates the interaction of A. thaliana with a beneficial fungus at low Pi [24], and its expression is regulated by the master regulator of phosphate stress response, PHR1 (PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1) [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the environmental Pi was low (30 M Pi), we observed many more differentially expressed genes between positive and negative blocks (Fig 6A), with negative blocks driving higher expression of genes of both the phosphate starvation and defense response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(A) Comparison of differentially expressed genes between all the positive (green) and all the negative blocks (magenta), in all conditions (top) or at 30 M Pi (bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first column shows all differentially expressed genes sorted by their log(fold-change), while the following columns indicate different functional annotations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbers at the top of each column show how many genes are marked and colored asterisks indicate a significant enrichment of the function among genes more expressed by positive (green asterisk) or negative (magenta asterisk) blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Panels (B) and (C) compare the expression of IPS1, a gene activated by low Pi, with (B) the JA response marker VSP2 and (C) the glucosinolate biosynthesis marker SUR1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression values are RPKM on a log10 scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Comparison of 103 differentially expressed genes between 2 negative bacterial blocks (N1, N3) under low Pi (30 M) condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rows represent genes and columns specific synthetic communities under different conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Color in the heat map shows the average expression of the corresponding genes across 2 independent experiments (3 replicates per experiment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hierarchical clustering dendrograms are shown for both genes and conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Color in the dendrogram indicates the block that is included in the corresponding condition (column) or that up-regulates the corresponding gene (columns).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Darker magenta color corresponds to block N3, and lighter magenta color corresponds to block N1, as in Fig 3B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes involved in stress response (Stress) are indicated on the right, and the logFC in expression between blocks N1 and N3 is also indicated, with positive values indicating a higher expression in the presence of block N1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Panels (E) and (F) compare the expression of IPS1 with (E), a phosphate starvation responseinduced ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme, PHO2 (F), and an auxin-regulated gene, ARGOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression values are RPKM in a log10 scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ellipses highlight samples from plants inoculated with synthetic communities P3N3 (pink asterisk) and N2N3 (blue asterisk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For panels (B), (C), (E), and (F), points on the axes represent samples in which the expression of the corresponding gene was not detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABA, abscisic acid; ARGOS, AUXIN-REGULATED GENE INVOLVED IN ORGAN SIZE; IPS1, INDUCED BY PHOSPHATE STARVATION1; JA, jasmonic acid; logFC, log(fold-change); PHO2, PHOSPHATE2; Pi, phosphate; PSR, Pi starvation response; RPKM, reads per kilobase per million; SA, salicylic acid; Stress, stress response; SUR1, SUPERROOT1; VSP2, VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003962.g006  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then focused our analysis on the Pi-limiting conditions (30 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this condition, synthetic communities containing negative blocks showed a strong induction of the phosphate starvation response (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We asked whether the different negative blocks (N1, N2, and N3) differed in their effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were almost no expression differences between the 2 most negative blocks (N2 and N3), but we identified 103 genes differentially regulated by bacterial blocks N1 and N3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genes were mostly stress-related genes, including general abiotic stress and defense response, the expression of which was comparatively reduced in the phenotypically more negative block N3 (Fig 6D, S6 and S7 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that under phosphate starvation, all negative blocks activate a similar set of phosphate starvation response genes but differentially suppress other stress responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that some genes were induced in response to specific block combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we found that PHOSPHATE2 (PHO2), a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme in A. thaliana required for the degradation of Pi transporters at high Pi [34], is highly expressed only in plants exposed to the synthetic community P3N3 in all Pi conditions analyzed (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding may explain the strong transcriptional response to Pi starvation caused by this synthetic community (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The auxin-regulated gene AUXIN-REGULATED GENE INVOLVED IN ORGAN SIZE (ARGOS) [35] showed a weak positive correlation with the induction of the phosphate starvation response, and it was induced in plants grown with the synthetic communities P3N3 and N2N3 (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARGOS controls organ size in A. thaliana and its transgenic expression results in enlarged aerial organs [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could serve to counterbalance the negative effect on shoot size that low Pi typically causes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our design of synthetic communities emphasized placing every bacterial functional block into at least 2 microbial backgrounds; therefore, we should be able to estimate bacterial effects that are independent of background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, this estimation could be used to design novel synthetic communities with predictable outputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that additivity of bacterial effects could explain most, but not all, of the host phenotypic variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we built 3 different quantitative predictive models capable of capturing different levels of complexity and evaluated their performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We constructed a simple linear model (LM), a linear model that included pairwise interactions between bacterial functional blocks (INT), and a Neural Network model (Fig 7A and Materials and methods 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on shoot Pi content, which had the strongest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of all plant phenotypes tested (S11 Fig, Materials and methods 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the predictive performance of each model, we used a form of cross validation in which the data from each synthetic community were held out one at a time, and the remaining synthetic communities were used to train each of the 3 models; those trained models were then used to predict the plant phenotypic output of the held-out consortium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the NN had the lowest cross-validated prediction error of the 3 models and that the difference was statistically significant (p-value = 0.0073) (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neural Networks are popular predictive models because they can capture more complex and nuanced relationships that simpler (linear) models cannot; however, this can come at a cost of reduced interpretability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a sensitivity analysis (Materials and methods 4f) by calculating the effect that changing each variable would have on shoot Pi content according to the NN and the 2 linear models (LM and INT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a general agreement between the 3 models; for example, all models showed that Pi level in the media and the presence of negative bacterial blocks had the strongest effect on shoot Pi content, but the NN produces much more fine-grained results, because it is able to predict the change differentially across each condition (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In order to validate the prediction accuracy of the NN, we chose the 25 bacterial block replacements that were predicted to result in the largest increase in shoot Pi content and experimentally tested whether an increase was produced by these synthetic communities (Fig 7D, S8 Table, and Materials and methods 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a significant correlation ( = 0.42, p-value = 0.0375) between predicted and observed shoot Pi content changes caused by the bacterial block replacements (Fig 7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, we found that 23 out of 25 bacterial block replacements increased shoot Pi content on average (p-value = 0.004; 1,000 permutation tests with synthetic community labels randomly permuted) (S9 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the improvement in shoot Pi content was statistically significant in 16 out of 25 bacterial block replacements (p-value = 0.032; 1,000 permutation tests with synthetic community labels randomly permuted) (S9 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 1 out of 25 bacterial block replacements significantly decreased Pi content (S9 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, we noted little correlation between bacterial abundances and their effect on Pi content (S12 Fig and S9 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to linear models (LM and INT), the NN had significantly lower prediction errors (p-value  4.65 × 107) (Fig 7F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we were able to rationally design novel synthetic communities that lead to predictable plant phenotypic outputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While plant responses to stress have been shown to be influenced by associated microbial communities, causal relationships in plantmicrobe interactions in a community context and measured phenotypes have proven difficult to establish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This limitation is, in fact, generally true across complex hostmicrobial interaction systems [12][13][36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that binary-association assays can inform the design of synthetic bacterial communities that lead to predictable plant phenotypes, an observation seen only once previously, in one animal system [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The host phenotypic output of the bacterial synthetic communities was consistent with the output expected from binary interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Validation of predictions from an NN confirmed that we could predictably alter certain plant phenotypes by changing the plants microbiota membership.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Other phenotypes and hostmicrobiota systems can likely be studied with this approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only requirements are that a microcosm reconstitution system is available and that functional bacterial blocks can be defined, so that synthetic communities that maximize the expected range of phenotypic variance can be constructed (Fig 3A and 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, other aspects that are likely to influence the tractability of a system are the functional bacterial diversity and the SNR of the phenotypes being measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of plant phosphate starvation, we found that bacterial abundances provided no information, and while it is too early to say if this is a general feature, the only other work that directly manipulated a well-defined microbiota to establish its effect on a host phenotype reached a similar conclusion [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this trend continues across other hostmicrobiota systems, then our approach has the added advantage that strains need not be distinguishable by a specific marker gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a simple additive model typically explained more than 50% of the host phenotypic variation, we found value in utilizing an NN approach that was able to capture more complex relationships but remained interpretable and significantly increased our prediction accuracy for novel communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our framework is based on empirical validation and thus remains flexible enough to allow for simpler or more complex models, depending on the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We achieved high prediction accuracy across an untested set of synthetic communities, thus demonstrating that selecting a subset of the possible communities by partial overlap of bacterial functional block pairs is sufficient to characterize this system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method requires no design of specific heuristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this methodology provides an opportunity to expand the capacity for mechanistic understanding not only of biological networks that control plant phenotypes [37][14] but of other complex ecological systems [12][13][36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, by focusing on block replacements as testable hypotheses, we provide a simple outcome that can be extracted from both linear and nonlinear predictive models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can guide the next set of experimental designs, thus providing nonlinear methods like deep learning a stronger empirical grounding, rendering them less of a black-box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrate the utility of our approach by defining mechanistic aspects of the plant phosphate stress response in the presence of combinations of bacterial blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that bacteria range in their effect on phosphate content in the plant between severely decreasing and moderately enhancing it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with our previous findings that bacterial interactions with the plant are controlled by negative regulation exerted by the phosphate starvation response on the plant immune system [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar mechanism was described for the interaction under phosphate-limiting conditions of A. thaliana with the beneficial fungus Colletotrichum tofieldiae [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results provide additional evidence for mechanisms by which plants and bacteria compete in times of nutritional stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The use of multiple bacterial synthetic communities led us to define interesting particular aspects of the phosphate stress response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that certain synthetic communities, such as P2P3 and P1P2, drive an increase in the shoot area compared to axenically grown plants, despite the low shoot Pi content that they engender.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data recapitulate a previous observation [31] on the effect of altering the activity of PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1), a gene required for Pi loading into the xylem [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These authors found that shoot Pi content could be uncoupled from the developmental responses typically linked to Pi scarcity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We corroborated that reduced shoot growth is not necessarily a direct consequence of Pi limitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observations that both bacterial activity and the modulation of PHO1 expression can uncouple plant phenotypes during the response to low Pi leads us to hypothesize that microbes could interdict PHO1 transport activity, thus modifying Pi translocation from roots to shoots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additionally, we found that synthetic community P3N3 uniquely induced a strong transcriptional response to phosphate starvation in the majority of the conditions tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants exposed to this bacterial combination showed a high-level induction of PHO2, a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme required for the degradation of Pi transporters at high Pi [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discovery may explain the intense transcriptional response to Pi starvation caused by this particular synthetic community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed much more variability in the bacterial colonization patterns than in their effects on plant phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synthetic communities tended to be dominated by 1 block, but the identity of that block did not correlate with plant phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, synthetic communities had remarkably consistent effects on plant phenotypes, and synthetic community membership was sufficient to predict host phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that bacteriabacteria interactions are critical for microbial community assembly, which is probably a highly dynamic process in which the microbial background determines which bacteria perform well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the effect of bacteria on plant phenotypes is probably due to functional stacking, in which many phenotypically redundant strains with potentially different niches maximize the chance of attaining the desired host phenotypic output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lottery model has been proposed as a major driving mechanism of host colonization by its microbiota at the taxonomic level [39], and it would be interesting to test whether a similar process governs functional assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we provide a general method for the study of various biological hostmicrobiome systems through rational selection of a tractable subset of the possible combinations of bacteria from a defined collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that complex relationships among host phenotypes, the microbiota, and the abiotic environment can be captured using deep learning techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By testing each block of bacterial strains in multiple synthetic communities, and successfully validating predictions derived from an NN, we demonstrated that it is possible to both infer causality and attain generality when it comes to predicting host phenotypes in this complex system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach contributes to the rational design and deployment of microbes to improve responses of hosts to biotic and nutritional stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

(A) Schematic representation of the pipeline used for screening the bacteria collection using plant exudates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For root exudate preparation, Col-0 seeds were germinated on Johnson medium, 0.5% sucrose, supplemented or not with 1 mM Pi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 7 days of growth, seedlings were transferred to the opposite concentration of Pi from the solid growth conditions (i.e., plants that were initially grown in 1 mM Pi were transferred to liquid medium with no supplementation of Pi [exudates +/] and vice versa [exudates /+]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants were grown in liquid media with agitation (30 rpm) for 24 hours in a growth chamber in a 16-hour light/8-hour dark regime (24°C/21°C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) For screening of the bacteria isolate collection in different plant root exudates, a single bacterial colony was inoculated in 200 L of 2×YT medium in a 96-well polystyrene plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial cultures were grown for 24 hours, and then all cultures were diluted 1/10 into the different plant exudates or into control media alone and grown for another 3 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exudate and media samples without bacteria were included as controls of contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical density at 600 nm was measured every 3 hours during the day and every 14 hours during the night.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Heat map showing the standardized abundances of all primary metabolites identified in exudate and control media with 1 mM Pi (control +) or without Pi (Control ) samples (S1 Table and Materials and methods 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Heat map showing the log(fold-change) of the 76 metabolites identified in the exudates, with respect to the media alone (Materials and methods 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, plants were grown in the conditions defined in (A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As additional controls, we transferred plants germinated without Pi to liquid Johnson medium not supplemented with Pi (exudates /) and plants germinated with 1 mM Pi to Johnson medium supplemented with 1 mM Pi (exudates +/+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also analyzed samples of liquid Johnson medium supplemented with 1 mM Pi (control +) and without Pi supplementation (control ), each in the absence of bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Col-0, Columbia-0; Pi, phosphate; rpm, revolutions per minute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

S6_Table_Table_contains_the_information_about_the_differential_expression_tests_for_the_20_494_genes_analyzed_in_the_RNA-Seq_experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each comparison, we provide the log2(fold-change) in relative expression between the 2 groups being compared (logFC), the log2 average counts per million (logcPM), the p-value of the test (Pvalue), and the p-value adjusted for multiple testing (FDR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed the following comparisons: comparison of samples that were inoculated with bacteria versus the axenic controls (Bacteria vs No Bacteria), comparison of the combined effect of positive blocks versus the combined effect of negative blocks (Positive vs Negative), comparison of the combined effect of negative blocks among both pretreatments in the 30 M posttreatment ((+Pi vs Pi) | 30 M), comparison of blocks N2 and N3 in the 30 M posttreatment ((N2 vs N3) | 30 M), comparison of blocks N1 and N3 in the 30 M posttreatment ((N1 vs N3) | 30 M), comparison of blocks N1 and N2 in the 30 M posttreatment ((N1 vs N2) | 30 M), and the main effect of each block (P1, P2, P3, I1, I2, I3, N1, N2, N3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Materials and methods and code for details on how comparisons were made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FDR, false discovery rate; logFC, log Fold Change; RNA-Seq, RNA sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

S7_Table_GO_enrichment_analysis_of_genes_differentially_expressed_in_Arabidopsis_thaliana_Col-0_in_response_to_different_bacterial_synthetic_communities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the Table, tab (a) (Cluster assignments) contains the 17,106 most variably expressed genes in A. thaliana seedlings in our RNA-Seq experiment in response to different bacterial synthetic communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes are clustered according to their relative expression profiles from all samples with a given bacterial treatment in each condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The table indicates the cluster assignment for each gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tabs (b)(h) show the GO enrichment analysis for each cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis was performed in the PlantGSEA web platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each tab contains the following information: descriptive name of the GO category (Description), ID in the GO database (GO ID), the total number of A. thaliana genes annotated with the corresponding GO term (Total), the number of A. thaliana genes in the corresponding cluster annotated with the corresponding GO term (Found), p-value of the enrichment test (p-value), and the adjusted p-value for multiple testing, using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (q-value).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See also S9A Fig, RNA-Seq clustering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Col-0, Columbia-0; GO, gene ontology; GO ID, GO identifier; RNA-Seq, RNA sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

S8_Table_List_of_the_top_25_hypotheses_generated_by_the_neural_network  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The table contains the 25 most significant hypotheses generated by our neural network for plants germinated without Pi supplementation and transferred to 30 M Pi in the presence of the synthetic communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The "Reference" column shows the original synthetic communities, into which we switched a bacterial block to generate "New" synthetic communities that were predicted to increase significantly the Pi content in the plant shoot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted increase in Pi content is shown in the "Predicted Mean Difference" column, and the log10 of the p-value associated with the prediction is shown in "log10 Predicted p-value" column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pi, phosphate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

S9_Table_Validation_results_of_the_top_25_hypotheses_generated_by_the_neural_network  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The table contains the validation results for the 25 most significant hypotheses generated by our neural network for plants germinated without Pi supplementation and transferred to 30 M Pi with the synthetic communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The "Reference" column shows the original synthetic communities into which we switched a bacterial block to generate "New" synthetic communities that were predicted to significantly increase the Pi content in the plant shoot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actual increase in mean Pi content from reference to previously untested synthetic communities is shown in the "Mean Difference" column, and the log10 of the p-value is shown in "log10 p-value" column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Color represents the experimental result: significant increase (green), nonsignificant increase (yellow), nonsignificant decrease (pink), and significant decrease (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pi, phosphate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
