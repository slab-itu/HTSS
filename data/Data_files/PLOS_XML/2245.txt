Predictive modelling of a novel anti-adhesion therapy to combat bacterial colonisation of burn wounds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the development of new classes of antibiotics slows, bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics is becoming an increasing problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A potential solution is to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas antibiotics act directly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth, anti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while simultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion therapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule 7 coupled polystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa burn wound infection in the rat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Benchmarking our model against in vivo data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain bacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of treatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model consists of two physical compartments: the host cells and the exudate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is found that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor treatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the host cells and by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the host cells into the exudate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the bacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or continuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our mathematical model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Humankind is engaged in an arms race; one we are in danger of losing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the development and application of the first antibiotics, resistant strains of bacteria have steadily emerged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the rate of discovery of new antibiotics slows, the threat increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, 700,000 individuals globally die each year due to antimicrobial resistance and this number is predicted to rise to 10 million per year by 2050 unless fresh action is taken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important, therefore, that we explore alternative treatment strategies to replace or complement traditional antimicrobials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use mathematical models to explain and predict the effects of a novel anti-adhesion therapy applied to infected burn wounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This theoretically resistance-proof therapy operates by impeding bacteria from binding to host cells by blocking the host cell binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prevents bacteria from accessing nutrients and renders them susceptible to artificial clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fitting our model to experimental data, we identify a number of valid parameter sets, and predict the conditions under which treatment will be effective for each set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These predictions are experimentally testable, and could be used to guide the development and application of anti-adhesion treatments in a clinical setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As we begin to lose the arms race against microbial infections, it is important that we develop new treatment strategies as a complement or alternative to antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we use mathematical modelling to explain and predict the effects of a novel anti-adhesion therapy in the treatment of infected burn wounds, with the aim of improving treatment outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each year, millions of lives are saved through the use of antibiotics to combat bacterial infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, sustained use of any given antibiotic leads to the clinical emergence of drug-resistant strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the discovery of penicillin, many new classes of antibiotics have been identified, allowing clinicians to switch between antibiotics if resistance emerges either within an individual patient or within a patient population [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over time, strains have emerged which exhibit resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics (multi-drug resistance) and reports of bacterial infections which are resistant to all known antibiotics (pan-resistant) are becoming increasingly common.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, a reported 700,000 individuals worldwide die each year due to antimicrobial resistance and this figure is predicted to rise to 10 million per year by 2050 unless steps are taken to combat this threat [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While resistant strains continue to evolve, our ability to develop new classes of antibiotics is diminishing, the rate of antibiotic discovery having slowed significantly since its Golden Era in the 1940s1960s [1, 3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore vital that we develop alternative treatment strategies to replace or complement antibiotics [4, 5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One potential way forward is through the use of anti-virulence treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas antibiotics either kill bacteria (bactericidal) or inhibit their growth (bacteriostatic), anti-virulence treatments interfere with a pathogens ability to cause damage and disease in the host [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, they are likely to exert a smaller selective pressure upon a bacterial community, reducing the chances that resistance will develop (though opinions vary over the extent to which they may be resistance-proof, see [7, 8]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-virulence treatments take a number of forms including those which target or inhibit toxin activity, adhesion, toxin secretion, virulence gene expression and inter-bacterial signalling [911].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this paper, we consider a form of anti-adhesion treatment consisting of polystyrene microbeads coupled to a protein known as multivalent adhesion molecule (MAM) 7 (see also [12] and other papers from their group for alternative anti-adhesion treatments that operate by blocking pilus assembly or function).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAM7 is anchored in the outer membrane of many Gram-negative bacteria, where it is responsible for initiating attachment of bacteria to host cells [13, 14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When applied to an infection site, MAM7-coated beads (henceforth, inhibitors) act as a bacteriomimetic, competitively inhibiting the infectious agent from binding to host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prevents bacteria from deploying those virulence mechanisms for which cell-to-cell contact is required and renders them more susceptible to natural or artificial physical clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that inhibitors must bind to host cells before bacteria in order to block them from binding, it is unclear whether their application may ever be expanded from prevention (prophylaxis) to the treatment of established infections (therapy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bacterial infection is a major cause of mortality in patients with burn wounds, where it is responsible for up to 75% of deaths in cases where severe burns are sustained to more than 40% of the body surface area [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Burn wounds are commonly infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa [1518], an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium; the infection often being hospital-acquired (nosocomial) [15, 19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Current treatment of such infections involves use of topical and systemic antibiotics, and regular debridement (mechanical wound cleaning).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Debridement is either achieved through regular wound cleansing with a cloth, or through application of negative pressure devices (negative pressure wound therapy, NPWT) in which fluid is drawn out of the wound, either continuously or intermittently, using a pump, attached to a foam dressing covering the wound [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some studies have shown NPWT to be effective in reducing the bacterial burden [21]; however, this result is not consistent across all studies [20, 22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In earlier work we have shown, using an experimental model for P. aeruginosa burn wound infections in the rat, that treatment with inhibitors can significantly reduce the bacterial burden in the wound without impeding wound closure [23] (see Experimental set-up for more details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of inhibitor treatment in reducing cytotoxicity [9, 24] and have shown that inhibitors do not interfere with host cell functions critical to wound healing [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A number of mathematical modelling studies have considered the use of anti-virulence treatments to combat bacterial infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of these studies focus upon anti-quorum sensing treatments (see, for example, [2633]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An exception to this rule; the model in [34] is of particular relevance to the present work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ordinary differential equation (ODE) model considers a general anti-virulence treatment, which operates by enhancing innate immunity in bacterial clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model predicts that, when used in isolation, anti-virulence treatment is unlikely to eliminate a bacterial infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the model predicts that, when combined with antibiotics, anti-virulence treatments could eliminate bacteria, provided antibiotic and anti-virulence treatments are applied in staggered doses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other modelling work has considered the bacterial invasion of burn wounds and the resultant tissue damage [30, 3537], the influence of bacterial infection upon the healing of burn wounds [38] and the effects of ambient gas plasma treatment in this context [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these models is formulated as a system of partial differential equations in one or two spatial dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models have also been developed to describe microbial adhesion to surfaces, for example, [40] developed an ODE model for the competitive colonisation of the gut wall by host and invader strains of Escherichia coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, [41] have developed an individual-based model to describe the colonisation of a generic surface by phenotypically heterogeneous bacteria, in which bacteria may migrate between the surface and a liquid medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this paper, we construct a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ODEs, to describe the population dynamics and treatment of a bacterial infection within a burn wound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basing our mathematical model upon Huebinger et al.s [23] experiments, we use it to explain the empirical results and to predict the effects of various treatment regimes, involving inhibitor dosing and debridement, with the aim of improving efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A particular strength of this study is that we consider multiple parameter sets, twelve in total, each of which provides a good fit to the experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Classifying these sets into four qualitatively different cases, we consider the long-term effects of each treatment strategy, predicting the conditions under which treatment will eliminate the bacterial burden across all four cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental_set-up  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this section we provide a simple description of the experimental set-up which forms the basis for our mathematical model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental work was published previously in [23], wherein a more detailed description can be found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We consider a burn wound infection model in the Sprague-Dawley rat (see Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rats were anaesthetised and the portion of each rat which was to be burned was shaved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rats were then immersed in 100°C water for 12s resulting in full-thickness cutaneous burns to 40% of the body surface area, in a region spanning the back and upper sides of the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We label the time at which the burn is administered as day 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rats were then resuscitated and given the appropriate pain control for the remainder of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 0, two days after the burn was administered, a section of eschar (dead) tissue, approximately 4 × 4 cm in area, was surgically excised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, 5 × 106 CFU (colony-forming units) of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were applied to the excised region, followed by suspensions containing either 3 × 108 inhibitor or control beads (without a MAM7 coating) in saline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identical inhibitor and control treatments were repeated every 24 hours for days 15 post infection; however, since a scab (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  a layer of solidified exudate) forms over the excision by day 1, treatments administered on or after day 1 are unlikely to enter the (liquid) exudate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rats were euthanized after the experiment, on day 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A bioluminescent, multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolate, Xen5, was chosen, such that the bacterial burden and their spatial distribution across the wound could be detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system (Perkin Elmer) was used to record bacterial luminescence on days 16 post infection, from which the total flux (photons sec1) was calculated using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) to integrate over the pixels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of bacteria in CFU was then calculated using the conversion factor 4 × 108 photons sec1  5 × 106 CFU, which was determined by measuring the luminescence of suspensions which contained an experimentally determined number of bacterial colony-forming units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
13 experiments were conducted using inhibitor and 11 using control beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two of the control bead experiments were discounted because the exposure setting used was too high to prevent the image from saturating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may imply that the mean bacteria population size over time calculated for the control bead scenario slightly underestimates the true mean value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental results are summarised in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results raise two important questions:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In what follows, we formulate a mathematical model of the burn wound infection experiment described above to help us answer these questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_formulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The burn wound is assumed to consist of two physical compartments: the host cells, and a fluid compartment exuded by the host cells and (hence) known as the exudate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The host cells and the overlying exudate extend to the perimeter of the burn wound beneath the necrotic tissue, while the exudate is exposed to the air at the excision (see Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area of the burn wound, Ar (cm2), remains essentially fixed during the experiment; however, the exudate height, h (cm), and volume, V (cm3), are elevated for a short period following the application of bacteria and inhibitors to the excision at the beginning of day 0 (see Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This excess fluid is lost rapidly via run-off (down the sides of the rat), evaporation and absorption (into the host cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the timescale over which the height and volume are elevated (on the order of minutes) is small compared to the timescale of the experiment (on the order of days), we neglect this variation and assume a fixed height and volume throughout the course of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both bacteria and inhibitors can exist in one of two states; either free in the exudate or bound to the host cells (we note that inhibitors do not bind to bacteria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is assumed that the system is well-mixed since any given bacteria (or inhibitor) has an equal chance of interacting with any given binding site and since all other processes (growth, clearance, phagocytosis and unbinding) are thought not to depend upon their spatial location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows us to forgo an explicit spatial component and so to construct an ODE model for the evolution of the free bacteria density, BF(t) (cells cm3), bound bacteria density, BB(t) (cells cm2), free inhibitor concentration, AF(t) (inhibitors cm3), and bound inhibitor concentration, AB(t) (inhibitors cm2), over time, t (hr).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is assumed that the total binding site density on the host cells, consisting of both free and occupied sites, is conserved, such that the free binding site density E(t) = Einit  BacBB(t)  AAB(t) (sites cm2), where Einit (sites cm2) is the initial density of free binding sites, and Bac (sites cell1) and A (sites inhibitor1) are the number of binding sites occupied by a bacterium or an inhibitor respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model is summarised in Fig 3B and described by the following governing equations  #@NEW_LINE#@#

where parameter values are given in Tables 1 and 2, and Table A in S2 Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Parameter fitting and S1 Supporting Information for details on how the parameters were obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that we consider multiple parameter sets, each of which provides a good fit to the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both free and bound bacteria are assumed to grow logistically with respective intrinsic growth rates rF (hr1) and rB (hr1), and carrying capacities KF (cells cm3) and KB (cells cm2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret the carrying capacities to represent the maximum number of bacteria that can be sustained by available nutrients and the situation in which BF(t) = KF, or BB(t) = KB, to be one in which the rate of bacterial division is negligible (see [42, 43]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The burn wound exudate contains glucose and other nutrients and has been shown to be capable of supporting a proliferating population of P. aeruginosa [44, 45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that, in general, KB  Einit/Bac, such that the number of bacteria that can be nourished on the host cells is not equal to the number that can bind to the host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all of the parameter sets considered in this paper, KB less_than Einit/Bac (see Tables 1 and 2, and Table A in S2 Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is assumed that bacteria and inhibitors bind to and unbind from the host cells in accordance with the law of mass action, with respective binding rates Bac (hr1 sites1) and A (hr1 sites1), and unbinding rates Bac (hr1) and A (hr1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Examination of histological sections through the burn wound shows that neutrophils are present within and at the surface of the host cells, but not within the exudate [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administration of a burn wound causes neutrophils to be fully activated such that no further neutrophils are recruited in response to the bacterial infection [23, 46] (in contrast to [34]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the immune response can be captured by the exponential decay of bound bacteria with rate B (hr1), where B accounts for the density of neutrophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is assumed that inhibitor degradation, if it occurs, is sufficiently gradual that it can be neglected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several of the terms in Eqs 14 contain h, Ar or V as a factor in order to ensure dimensional consistency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These constants could have been combined with other parameters, but we retain them in the interests of clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A proportion of the daughter cells of bound bacteria, 0  (E(t))  1 (dimensionless), remain bound to the surface, while the remaining fraction, 1  (E(t)), enter the exudate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daughter cells may not bind immediately either because the long axis of the parent cell is angled away from the host cell surface upon division or due to a lack of free binding sites on the neighbouring host cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion that remains bound, (E(t)), depends upon the density of free binding sites, E(t), such that a larger fraction of the daughter cells remain bound when more binding sites are available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We capture this dependence using a Hill function with constant  (sites cm2) and Hill coefficient n (dimensionless) as follows  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(5)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where max (dimensionless) is the maximum proportion of daughter cells which may remain bound to the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the density of bound cells, BB(t), exceeds the bound carrying capacity, KB, then the bound logistic growth term becomes a death term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the loss of bacteria is confined to the bound compartment and does not affect the free compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is achieved through the use of a Heaviside step function, H(KB  BB(t)), in Eqs 1 and 2, where  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(6)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The rates of clearance of bacteria and inhibitors, Bac(t) (hr1) and A(t) (hr1), vary with time, such that clearance occurs at a constant rate for the first 24 hours and then stops after this point due to the formation of a scab over the excision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, clearance occurs at rates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(7)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where  (hr1) and  (hr1) are the constant rates of clearance in the first 24 hours, and H is a Heaviside step function, as defined in Eq 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We choose the time t = 0 (hr) to correspond to the point at which bacteria and inhibitors are applied to the burn wound following the excision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria and inhibitors are present only in the free compartment initially, not having had the opportunity to bind to the host cells, such that  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(8)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where  and  are constants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Tables 1, 2 and Table A in S2 Supporting Information for parameter values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The parameters in Table 1 and Table A in S2 Supporting Information were fitted to the experimental data (see Parameter fitting and S1 Supporting Information for details), while those in Table 2 were either measured, calculated or estimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area of each burn wound was determined from images, such as those in Fig 1, using the MetaMorph software, while the height of the fluid layer was measured to be 1 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in Experimental set-up, the initial density of bacteria and the initial concentration of inhibitor are known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume of the exudate is calculated as the product of the wound area and the height of the exudate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We know that there are about 1.5 × 105 host cells per cm2 and that approximately 17 inhibitors may bind per host cell [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking the product of these two values gives us the initial density of free binding sites, Einit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define a binding site to consist of the number of host cell binding receptors occupied by an inhibitor, such that an inhibitor occupies a single site and hence A = 1 sites inhibitor1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibitors have been designed to occupy the same number of host cell binding receptors as a bacterium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we also have that Bac = 1 sites cell1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that while an inhibitor occupies the same number of binding sites as a bacterium, a rod-shaped P. aeruginosa cell (which we have measured to be approximately 1m×3m) covers up to three times the host cell surface area as a spherical (1 m diameter [23]) inhibitor without occupying any more sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations were found to be insensitive to the value of the Hill coefficient, n; therefore, we set it to unity for simplicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We leave our equations in dimensional form so as to make them easier to interpret biologically and since non-dimensionalisation would not reduce the number of fitted parameters (although it does reduce the total number of parameters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Treatment_scenarios  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the untreated/control () and single inhibitor dose () scenarios based upon Huebinger et al.s [23] experiments (see Experimental set-up), we consider a further six theoretical scenarios, five of which include either regular or continuous debridement (see Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since inhibitors operate by blocking bacteria from binding to the wound host cells, it is intuitive that this may result in the majority of bacteria occupying the free compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, any treatment, such as debridement, which removes the exudate, could clear the free compartment of bacteriaand with them, inhibitorssignificantly reducing the total population size of bacteria when combined with an inhibitor treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Bound bacteria and inhibitors are left mostly intact by debridement.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regular debridement consists of a series of discrete instantaneous debridement events, while continuous debridement consists of a sustained, high level of clearance (Bac = A = 1000 hr1) and may be thought of as the limiting case of regular debridement in which the time between debridement events tends to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it may not be possible to maintain such a high rate of clearance in practice, this clearance rate is chosen to determine the theoretical best-case-scenario were such a treatment to be applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a discrete debridement event, it is assumed that the fluid compartment is restored on the timescale of a few minutes, such that the volume fluctuation can be neglected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each of the treatment strategies, Eqs 18 were solved using the Matlab routine ode15s, a variable-step, variable-order solver based upon numerical differentiation formulas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The untreated and single inhibitor dose scenarios are those considered in the experiments and are described above and in Experimental set-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key difference between the numerical simulations (see Numerical solutions) and the experiments is that the simulations extend beyond the time frame of the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the regular inhibitor dose scenario (and the regular inhibitor dose with regular debridement scenario), the repeat doses of inhibitors are identical to the initial dose, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second dose is not applied until 48 hr for consistency with the treatments involving debridement (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted in Experimental set-up, a scab forms over the wound after the first 24 hr, ending clearance and preventing further inhibitor doses from reaching the exudate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in practice, inhibitor doses could not be repeated without removing the scab and incurring further clearance at levels similar to those in the first 24 hr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since we are interested in the theoretical effect of repeated inhibitor doses independent of clearance, we neglect further clearance effects in this case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Were we to include additional clearance upon re-treatment with inhibitor, treatment efficacy would be improved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the scenarios involving regular debridement, clearance is re-established for the first 24 hours after each debridement event, with rates given in Table 1 and Table A in S2 Supporting Information, to account for leakage due to the loss of the scab upon debridement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first debridement event is chosen to occur at t = 48 hr, rather than some earlier time, so as to give the inhibitors time to bind to the host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sensitivity_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present two sets of sensitivity analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first set (presented in Case ACase D) shows the effect of a tenfold increase or decrease in each of the 13 fitted parameters, rF, rB, KF, KB, Bac, Bac, B, max, , , A, A and , on the total number of bacteria either at steady-state (treatment scenarios 1 and 2) or at t = 90 days = 2160 hr (treatment scenarios 38; Figs OV in S2 Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We truncate the simulations for the latter treatment scenarios at 90 days since simulating treatments with regular inhibitor doses or regular debridement is computationally expensive and those involving continuous debridement are close to steady-state by this time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the total population size of bacteria oscillates in those treatments that involve regular debridement, undergoing a sharp drop upon each debridement event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We plot the value of BT(t) at the peak of the oscillation at t = 90 days (directly prior to debridement), since we consider that it is by the maximum number of bacteria that the efficacy of a treatment should be judged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the second set of sensitivity analyses (presented in Inhibitor sensitivity analysis), we consider the effect of varying the binding and unbinding rates of inhibitors, A and A, in the space {1012, 1011, , 1} × {1012, 1011, , 1} upon the total number of bacteria at 4 weeks (= 672 hr) post infection in the 5 scenarios that involve inhibitor treatment (Figs W, Y, AA, AC and AE in S2 Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also consider the effect of increasing all inhibitor doses by 10 fold from 6.12 × 107 inhibitors cm3 (the standard value) to 6.12 × 108 inhibitors cm3 (Figs X, Z, AB, AD and AF in S2 Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

A combination of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and frequentist methods were used to fit the model given by Eqs 18 to the mean of the experimental data in the untreated and single inhibitor dose scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, we have insufficient data to generate informative posterior distributions using the MCMC method; however, we are able to identify a number of good fits (twelve parameters sets are presented here) and to classify these into four general casesA, B, C and Dbased upon their qualitative behaviour (see Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By considering a range of valid parameter sets, rather than a single good fit, we are able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the model behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fitting procedures used differ between parameter sets and are summarised in Table A in S1 Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See S1 Supporting Information for more details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed these fits with a nonlinear mixed-effects model using the Matlab routine sbiofitmixed, with parameter sets 112 as initial guesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model fits are compared against the experimental data in Fig 4 and Figs A and B in S2 Supporting Information, where parameter sets 2 (Case A), 3 (Case B), 8 (Case C) and 12 (Case D) are presented in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the experimental data does not distinguish between free and bound bacteria, we compare it against the simulated total number of bacteria, BT(t) = VBF(t) + ArBB(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model achieves a good fit to the experimental mean in all cases, remaining mostly within the shaded region denoting the standard error of the mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In what follows, we examine the behaviour of Eqs 18 in each of the four cases, AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For clarity, the results from four representative parameter sets, one from each case, are presented in the main text: Set 2 from Case A, Set 3 from Case B, Set 8 from Case C and Set 12 from Case D. For the complete set of results, see S2 Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We begin with a steady-state analysis of the system with and without a single inhibitor dose in order to determine the number of steady-states and their stability properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then consider the behaviour of the time-dependent problem, simulating the bacterial population dynamics well beyond the time frame of the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While simulations provide a good fit to the experimental data for all parameter sets, the model predictions diverge for later times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigate why a single inhibitor dose is or is not effective in each case in the long-term and explore other potential treatment strategies with the aim of improving efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider a treatment to be effective if it reduces the bacterial burden and to be fully effective if the bacterial burden is eliminated (such that BT(t) less_than 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Steady-state_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Steady-state analyses of Eqs 16, in the absence of clearance, with and without a single dose of inhibitors were performed using Maple.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearance was neglected since leakage of fluid from the wound only occurs in the first 24 hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was found that the system has two physically realistic steady-states in both the untreated and single inhibitor dose scenarios for all 12 parameter sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each case the first steady-state, at which bacteria are absent, is unstable, while the second steady-state, at which both free and bound bacteria are present, is stable (see S3 Supporting Information for more details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By characterising the stability of the system in this way, we can be sure that we are not overlooking any potential stable steady-state solutions in the time-dependent simulations below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Numerical_solutions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having explored the behaviour of the system at steady-state, we consider the full time-dependent problem (Eqs 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We begin by making a few general comments, before taking Cases AD in turn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details can be found in S4 Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In each case we present results to show the evolution in the total number of bacteria, BT(t) = VBF(t) + ArBB(t) (Fig 5, and Fig D in S2 Supporting Information), the total numbers of free and bound bacteria,  and , free and bound inhibitors,  and , and free binding sites,  (Fig 6, and Figs E and F in S2 Supporting Information), and of the individual terms in Eqs 14 (Figs GL in S2 Supporting Information) in the untreated and single inhibitor dose scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also present results to show the evolution in the total number of bacteria in the treatment scenarios involving regular inhibitor doses and regular or continuous debridement (Fig 7, and Figs M and N in S2 Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, we present a sensitivity analysis showing the effects of a tenfold increase or decrease in each of the 13 fitted parameters (Figs OV in S2 Supporting Information, see Sensitivity analyses for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the remainder of this paper, we distinguish between rate constants, e.g., Bac and B, and the rate at which processes occur, e.g., BacArBFE and BBB, the former being distinguished from the latter by the use of the word constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also distinguish between the intrinsic growth rate, e.g., rF, and the rate of logistic growth, e.g., rFBF(1  BF/KF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The time-dependent results are summarised in Table 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatments are most effective in Case A, some of them eliminating the bacterial burden completely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most treatment scenarios are also effective in Case B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, treatment with inhibitors can actually increase the bacterial burden in Case C, although some treatments are still effective, while in Case D all treatments are ineffective, the bacterial burden settling to its untreated steady-state in all scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When effective, treatment with inhibitors may reduce the total bacterial burden in two ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firstly, inhibitors may reduce the number of bound bacteria through competition for binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second way, which may follow as a consequence of the first, is by reducing the rate of production of daughter cells by bound bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We note that the maximum proportion of bound daughter cells to enter the bound compartment, max, ranges between O(1010) and O(102), across the 12 parameter sets considered (see Table 1, and Table A in S2 Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the majority of bound daughter cells enter the exudate in all cases (though, once there, they will not continue to divide if the free carrying capacity is exceeded).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This insight is not intuitively obvious, demonstrating the benefit of mathematical modelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As bacteria gain increasing resistance to antibiotics it is vital that we develop alternative treatment strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-virulence treatmentsspecifically MAM7-coupled beads, which operate by competitively inhibiting the binding of bacteria to host cellspresent a promising complement or alternative to antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Opinion as to the likely efficacy of such treatments is mixed, with some suggesting that their utility may be limited to preventing the initiation of a bacterial infection (prophylaxis) as opposed to treating a pre-existing infection (therapy) [6, 10, 47, 48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper we have used mathematical models to help us interpret the results of an experimental model, involving the inhibitor treatment of a burn wound infected by P. aeruginosa in the rat (see Experimental set-up).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our models allow us to predict the conditions under which treatment with inhibitors will be effective and to explore ways in which inhibitor dosing could be augmented to improve efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mathematical models were fitted to experimental data using a combination of MCMC and frequentist techniques (Parameter fitting).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of close fits were obtained (12 parameter sets are explored here) and classified into four qualitatively different cases (AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the significant qualitative, and not merely quantitative, differences in predicted treatment outcomes between Cases AD, this work highlights the importance of considering a range of viable parameter sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Had a single parameter set been chosen, our conclusions would have differed markedly from those in this more comprehensive study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be that different parameters sets could reflect inter-patient variability, as well as different bacterial species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a variety of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria have been found to infect burn wounds (see, for example, [1517, 19]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eight treatment scenarios were considered for each of Cases AD (see Treatment scenarios for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The untreated and single inhibitor dose scenarios were considered in the experimental model, while the rest are theoretical treatments that remain to be tested experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous debridement, with clearance rates on the order of magnitude of those used in simulations, is probably not practically achievable; though it might be possible to maintain a high level of clearance using negative pressure wound therapy (see Introduction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, these simulations allow us to determine the theoretical best-case scenario where debridement is applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulations for the 8 treatment scenarios in Cases AD reveal a range of outcomes and provide insight into the bacterial population dynamics (Case ACase D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before considering each case in turn, a few general observations can be made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firstly, while the ratio between the number of bacteria at carrying capacity in the free and bound compartments, VKF and ArKB respectively, varies between parameter sets, the intrinsic growth rate in the bound compartment, rB, is consistently greater than that of the free compartment, rF (see Table 1 and Table A in S2 Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the bound compartment is more favourable to the growth of bacteria than the free compartment, agreeing nicely with Huebinger et al.s [23] speculative explanation for the efficacy of inhibitor treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be because bound bacteria have access to additional nutrients derived from the host cells, not available to free bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our model predicts that in order for inhibitor treatment to be effective, inhibitors must bind rapidly and numerously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If they do not, then treatment may actually worsen a bacterial infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If inhibitors bind in sufficient quantities to the host cells, then the number of bacteria in the bound compartment and hence their rate of logistic growth will remain small, reducing the flux of bound daughter cells into the free compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if inhibitors bind in lower numbers, then while the number of bound bacteria at steady-state may be reduced, their logistic growth rate increases (see Fig 8) as does the flux of bound daughter cells into the free compartment, with the result that inhibitor treatment increases the total number of bacteria at steady-state above its untreated value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If debridement is applied too early, as in Set 7, it may reduce treatment efficacy as inhibitors will have had insufficient time to bind before those in the free compartment are removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If inhibitor binding rates could be determined experimentally then this would allow us to determine the optimum timing of debridement in relation to inhibitor dosing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All treatments are effective in significantly reducing the bacterial population size in Case A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Case B, all treatments except regular debridement and a single inhibitor dose with regular debridement are consistently effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counterintuitively, a single inhibitor dose increases the bacterial burden in Case C, with treatments involving continuous debridement being the most effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, in Case D, all of the treatment strategies result in a steady-state bacterial population size similar to that without treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The differences in behaviour between Cases AD may be explained, to some extent, by the differences in the bacteria and inhibitor association constants and the ratio of these constants (see Table 1, and Table A in S2 Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bacteria association constant is lower in Case A than in Cases BD, while the inhibitor association constant and the ratio of these constants are lowest in Case A, highest in Cases CD and take intermediate values in Case B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatments are more effective where the inhibitor association constant is higher and the bacterial association constant is lower, and hence where the ratio of association constants is lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The qualitative difference between Cases C and D is less significant than between the other cases, thus it is not surprising that the order of magnitude of their association constants and their ratio are not distinct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the correlation between bacteria and inhibitor association constants and treatment efficacy, a natural way to seek to improve treatment would be to decrease the bacterial association constant or to increase the inhibitor association constant, shifting the system behaviour towards that in Case A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bacterial association constant could be reduced by treating with a molecule that binds to and blocks bacterial adhesins used for binding to the host cells e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mannosides, which bind FimH [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order for these molecules not to interfere with the inhibitor treatment they would need to either bind to an adhesin other than MAM7 or be applied to a wound before the inhibitor dose, giving the molecules time to bind to the bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibitor association constant could be increased by coupling more MAM7 molecules to each bead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sensitivity analysis of the inhibitor binding rate constant, unbinding rate constant and dose concentration predicts conditions under which treatments involving inhibitor would eliminate the bacterial burden within 28 days (Inhibitor sensitivity analysis, Fig 9, and Figs WAF in S2 Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither a single nor regular doses of inhibitor on their own were predicted to be capable of eliminating the bacterial population, though they may reduce it by several orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is to be expected since, on its own, inhibitor can only prevent bacteria from entering the bound compartment, and is unable to remove bacteria from the free compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encouragingly, when combined with regular or continuous debridement, inhibitor treatment is predicted to have the potential to eliminate the bacterial population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single inhibitor dose with continuous debridement is predicted to be the most effective treatment, followed by regular inhibitor doses with regular debridement, with a single inhibitor dose with regular debridement being the least effective of the three.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment is predicted to be more effective for higher binding rate constants, lower unbinding rate constants and higher concentration inhibitor doses, where treatment efficacy is more sensitive to the binding rate constant than to the unbinding rate constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In future work we will proceed on two fronts: experimental and theoretical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will conduct further experiments to test our model predictions and to improve model parametrisation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments like those described in Experimental set-up could be performed over a longer time-span and separate measurements made for the numbers of free and bound bacteria and inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would enable us to refine the range of possible parameter sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would also be aided by more regular wound imaging than the current daily set-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further experiments to test the model predictions concerning the other treatment strategies suggested here would also be valuable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will develop our mathematical modelling in at least two directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firstly, we will incorporate treatment with antibiotics, seeking to determine the optimum treatment regime when combined with inhibitor dosing and regular or continuous debridement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, we will consider a discrete-stochastic cellular automata model to capture some of the mechanisms in the system in more detail, including the spatial spread of infection, which has been shown experimentally to be limited upon treatment with inhibitor [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our models could also be extended to incorporate quorum sensing and biofilm formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, our mathematical models suggest that inhibitor treatment could be effective in eliminating or significantly reducing the bacterial burden in a burn wound when combined with regular or continuous debridement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where inhibitor treatment is effective, it operates both by preventing bacteria from occupying the host cells (where growth rates are predicted to be higher) and, consequently, by reducing the flux of bound daughter cells into the exudate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model predicts that inhibitor treatments, in particular those involving regular or continuous debridement, could be effective when used both prophylactically and therapeutically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our models further predict that treatment efficacy can be improved by optimising inhibitor design and dosing schedules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
