Novel pedigree analysis implicates DNA repair and chromatin remodeling in multiple myeloma risk  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high-risk pedigree (HRP) design is an established strategy to discover rare, highly-penetrant, Mendelian-like causal variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its success, however, in complex traits has been modest, largely due to challenges of genetic heterogeneity and complex inheritance models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe a HRP strategy that addresses intra-familial heterogeneity, and identifies inherited segments important for mapping regulatory risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply this new Shared Genomic Segment (SGS) method in 11 extended, Utah, multiple myeloma (MM) HRPs, and subsequent exome sequencing in SGS regions of interest in 1063 MM / MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significancea precursor to MM) cases and 964 controls from a jointly-called collaborative resource, including cases from the initial 11 HRPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One genome-wide significant 1.8 Mb shared segment was found at 6q16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exome sequencing in this region revealed predicted deleterious variants in USP45 (p.Gln691* and p.Gln621Glu), a gene known to influence DNA repair through endonuclease regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, a 1.2 Mb segment at 1p36.11 is inherited in two Utah HRPs, with coding variants identified in ARID1A (p.Ser90Gly and p.Met890Val), a key gene in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide compelling statistical and genetic evidence for segregating risk variants for MM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we demonstrate a novel strategy to use large HRPs for risk-variant discovery more generally in complex traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although family-based studies demonstrate inherited variants play a role in many common and complex diseases, finding the genes responsible remains a challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-risk pedigrees, or families with more disease than expected by chance, have aided discovery of genes responsible for less complex diseases, but high-risk pedigrees have not reached their potential in complex diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe a method to utilize high-risk pedigrees to discover risk-genes in complex diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our method is appropriate for complex diseases because it allows for genetic-heterogeneity, or multiple causes of disease, within a pedigree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method allows us to identify shared segments that likely harbor disease-causing genes in a family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply our method in Myeloma, a heritable and complex cancer of plasma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified two genes USP45 and ARID1A that fall within shared segments with compelling statistical evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exome sequencing of these genes revealed likely-damaging variants inherited in Myeloma high-risk families, suggesting these genes likely play a role in development of Myeloma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Myeloma findings demonstrate our high-risk pedigree method can identify genetic regions of interest in large high-risk pedigrees that are also relevant to smaller nuclear families and overall disease risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, we offer a strategy, applicable across phenotypes, to revitalize high-risk pedigrees in the discovery of the genetic basis of common and complex disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rare risk variants have been suggested as a source of missing heritability in the majority of complex traits [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-risk pedigrees (HRPs) are a mainstay for identifying rare, highly penetrant, Mendelian-like, causal variants [411].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while HRPs have been successful for relatively simple traits, genetic heterogeneity remains a major obstacle that reduces the effectiveness of HRPs for gene mapping in complex traits [12,13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also challenging is mapping regulatory variants, likely to be important for complex traits, necessitating interrogation outside the well-annotated, coding regions of the genome [14,15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localizing chromosomal regions to target the search for rare, risk variants will be instrumental in mapping them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we develop a HRP strategy based on our previous Shared Genomic Segment (SGS) approach [16] that focuses on pedigrees sufficiently large to singularly identify segregating chromosomal segments of statistical merit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method addresses genetic heterogeneity by optimizing over all possible subsets of studied cases in a HRP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Key to the utility of the method is the derivation of significance thresholds for interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These thresholds address the genome-wide search and the multiple testing inherent from the optimization through use of distribution fitting and the Theory of Large Deviations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We apply this novel method to 11 MM HRPs, and use exome sequencing from a collaborative resource of 55 multiplex MM or MM/MGUS pedigrees to perform subsequent targeted searches at the variant level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MM is a complex cancer of the plasma cells with 30,330 new cases annually (incidence 6.5/100,000 per year) [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite survival dramatically increasing from 25.8% in 1980 to 48.5% in 2012, MM remains a cancer with one of the lowest 5-year survival rates in adult hematological malignancies [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MM is preceded by a condition referred to as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence for the familial clustering of MM is consistently replicated [1821], as is its clustering with MGUS [2225].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic pedigree studies in MM are scarce as it remains a challenge to acquire samples in pedigrees due to rarity and low survival rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Utah MM HRPs are one of only a few pedigree resources worldwide and contains unparalleled multi-generational high-risk pedigrees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus far, no segregating risk variants have been identified for MM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pedigree_analysis_strategy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed a gene mapping strategy, based on the SGS method [16,26], that accounts for intra-familial heterogeneity and multiple testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basic SGS method identifies all genomic segments shared identical-by-state (sharing without regard to inheritance) between a defined set of cases using a dense genome-wide map of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), either from a genotyping platform or extracted from sequence data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the length of a shared segment is significantly longer than by chance, inherited sharing is implied; theoretically, chance inherited sharing in distant relatives is extremely improbable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nominal chance occurrence (nominal p-value) for shared segments is assessed empirically using gene-drop simulations to create a null distribution, as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Null genotype configurations are generated by assigning haplotypes to pedigree founders according to a publicly available linkage disequilibrium (LD) map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These null genotypes are segregated through the pedigree structure to the case set via simulated Mendelian inheritance according to a genetic (recombination) map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Gene-drops are performed independent of disease status.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting genotype data in the case set are representative of chance sharing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This basic method was shown to have excellent power in homogeneous pedigrees [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our new strategy, we address heterogeneity within pedigrees in a brute-force fashion by iterating over all non-trivial combinations of the cases (subsets) in each pedigree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each subset, shared segments at every position throughout the genome are identified and nominal p-values assigned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across subsets, an optimization procedure is performed, at every marker across the genome, to identify the segment with the most significant sharing evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All shared segments selected by the optimization procedure, and their respective p-values, comprise the final optimized SGS results for a pedigree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To perform significance testing and identify segments that are unexpected by chance (hypothesized to harbor risk loci), we derive significance thresholds to account for the genome-wide optimization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acknowledging that the vast majority of observed sharing across a genome is under the null (true risk loci are a very small minority of the genome), we use the observed optimized results (Y = log10(p), where p is the nominal p-value) to model the distribution for optimized SGS results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that this approach may be slightly conservative because signals for true risk loci are also included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified the gamma distribution as adequate to represent the distribution (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the fitted distribution, Y(k, ), where k and  are the shape and rate parameters, we apply the Theory of Large Deviationspreviously applied to successfully model genome-wide fluctuations in linkage analysis [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance threshold, T, accounts for multiple testing of optimized segments across the genome, and is found by solving Eq 1:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(1)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where T = 10X/2,  is the genome-wide false positive rate required, C is the number of chromosomes, (X) is nominal probability of exceeding X, and G is the genome length in Morgans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A criterion of (X) = 0.05 is used to define the genome-wide significant threshold (false positive rate of 0.05 per genome), and (X) = 1 to define the genome-wide suggestive threshold (false positive rate of 1 per genome).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In general, we found that the fitted distributions produced stable significance thresholds after 100,000300,000 simulations (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, threshold determination requires 1,0003,000 CPU hours per pedigree, increasing with the number of subsets and separating meioses between pedigree cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in pedigree UT-571744, 300k simulations genome-wide (2,513,408 segments) took 1,275 CPU hours on tangent nodes featuring Intel Xeon E5-2650 processors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once significance thresholds are established, subset/segment combinations of potential interest are identified and additional simulations are restricted to those combinations to gain the required p-value resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these subsequent targeted simulations, we use a marginalized LD map specific for the segment of interest, dramatically reducing the analysis time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in pedigree UT-571744, 600M simulations on one segment took 325 CPU hours on tangent nodes featuring Intel Xeon E5-2650 processors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See S1 Fig for an overview of the strategy pipeline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Application_to_Utah__MM_HRPs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We applied our new pedigree analysis strategy to 11 Utah MM HRPs using high-density OMNI Express SNP array genotype data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each pedigree was selected to contain excess MM (437 MM total per pedigree), had 24 sampled MM cases with genotype data, and 823 meioses per pedigree between the sampled cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After quality control, a consistent set of 678,447 SNPs were used for all SGS analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of shared segments for each pedigree across all subsets ranged from 638,525 to 6,765,500 (larger pedigrees with more subsets producing larger numbers of segments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After optimization, Y = log10(p) for 6,697 to 10,369 segments were fit to gamma distributions for each pedigree, and used to determine genome-wide significant and suggestive thresholds (Eq 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genome-wide significant thresholds ranged from 6.2×105 to 7.8×107 and genome-wide suggestive from 8.2×104 to 2.1×105 (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A genome-wide significant, 1.8 Mb shared segment (p = 3.3x10-6) was observed in pedigree UT-571744.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three genotyped MM cases, separated by 20 meioses, share the segment (Fig 2A and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The segment is located at chromosome 6q16 (98.49100.24 Mb; hg19) and includes 9 genes: POU3F2, FBXL4, FAXC, COQ3, PNISR, USP45, TSTD3, CCNC, and PRDM13 (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also identified two HRPs, UT-576834 and UT-260, with overlapping borderline, genome-wide suggestive, shared segments at 1p36.11 (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 8.9 Mb (24.3933.30 Mb, p = 3.0×104) segment was observed in 3 of the 4 genotyped MM cases in UT-576834, shared across 12 meioses (Fig 3B and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A nested 1.2 Mb shared segment (26.2227.38 Mb; p = 2.1×104) segregated to 3 MM cases separated by 16 meioses in UT-260 (Fig 3A and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overlapping segment contains 30 genes (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Exome_follow-up_of_shared_segments_in_HRPs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) data was interrogated, targeted to the identified SGS region, to identify potential risk variants in the pedigree sharers in the HRP and in a broader set of 44 pedigrees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WES data was available for: 28 cases from the 11 extended Utah HRPs; and 126 exomes from 44 densely clustered MM/MGUS families from Mayo Clinic Rochester, Weill Cornell, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, International Agency for Research on Cancer, and INSERM France (S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prioritization was used to identify variants that were: in the target segment; rare (alternate allele frequency, AAFless_than0.001 in the non-Finnish, European, gnomAD individuals), potentially deleterious (variant impact predicted to be high or moderate); and observed recurrently in the appropriate segment sharers (if observed in the segment discovery pedigree).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At 6q16, no rare, potentially deleterious coding risk variants were shared by the 3 UT-571744 MM cases in the 1.8 Mb genome-wide significant segment, indicating non-coding regulatory variants may be responsible for MM risk in this pedigree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, two, rare coding and potentially deleterious single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified in two MM/MGUS families (Fig 2C2E and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both SNVs are in the hydrolase domain of USP45: a stop gain (p.Gln691*) shared by 3 sibling cases (1 MM and 2 MGUS) in an INSERM family (PET-Nice 0909) and a missense SNV (p.Gln621Glu) shared by 2 siblings (1 MM and 1 MGUS) but not their 2 screened unaffected siblings in Mayo family 485.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coverage of these positions in ExAC sequence data is high ( greater than  99% of the 60,706 ExAC samples had at least 10x read coverage) and neither variant was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collating the SGS evidence in UT-571744 (genome-wide rate of  = 0.042) with the sequence findings, correcting for 11 SGS pedigrees, the 45 pedigrees interrogated for sequence variants, and the 9 genes in the SGS region, we estimate the rate of observing all these findings at the 6q16 region by chance is very low ( = 0.0026, see Methods) and study-wide significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pedigree exomes in the 1.2 Mb segment at 1p36.11 revealed two, rare and potentially deleterious SNVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first in discovery pedigree UT-576834: a missense SNV (rs752026201, p.Ser90Gly, AAF = 0.0002 in gnomAD) in ARID1A (Fig 3E) shared by 3 of the 4 Utah MM cases, concordant with the segment sharing pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second rare, missense SNV in ARID1A (rs140664170, p.Met890Val, AAF = 0.0001 in gnomAD) was found to be carried by a pair of MM cousins in Weill-Cornell family 12 (Fig 3C and 3E, and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No rare, potentially deleterious coding risk variants were shared by the 3 MM cases in UT-260.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the ExAC data, ARID1A is extremely intolerant to missense variants and loss of function (LoF) SNVs [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pathway_follow-up_of_candidate_genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our SGS findings and pedigree WES identify USP45 and ARID1A as candidate genes for inherited MM risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further investigated shared segments and WES for evidence supporting the complexes USP45 and ARID1A are involved in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we further expanded our WES to: 186 MM/MGUS cases (early onset MM/MGUS or familial MGUS) from our collaborative group, 733 sporadic MM cases from dbGaP [29], and 964 controls [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
USP45 is an essential DNA repair regulator, de-ubiquitylating ERCC1 to allow for DNA translocation of the ERCC1-ERCC4 endonuclease [31,32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This endonuclease is a part of the global genome nucleotide-excision repair (GG-NER) incision complex, a 22 protein complex essential to removing lesions from DNA and cancer prevention [3336] (S3 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reviewed SGS results in the Utah HRPs at the location of these 22 genes and identified a genome-wide suggestive segment in pedigree UT-34955 (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This HRP identified a 0.8 Mb segment at 19q13 (45.7146.51 Mb; hg19), containing 31 genes including ERCC1 and ERCC2 (S2 Fig and S4 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The segment is shared by 3 MM cases separated by 16 meioses (p = 6.6×105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No rare, coding variants were identified from the WES in the 3 MM cases in UT-34955, nor in the remaining 44 pedigrees/families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interrogated the 23 GG-NER genes in our 919 MM/MGUS exomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This identified a ClinVar-annotated pathogenic, missense SNV in ERCC4 (p.Arg799Trp) in one early-onset MM case and one sporadic MM case, and a stop-gain SNV in ERCC3 (p.Arg574Ter), in the same domain as a ClinVar-annotated pathogenic variant, in a second early-onset MM case (S4 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, burden testing in all MM cases vs controls was significant in 2 of the 23 GG-NER genes: GTF2H1 and DDB1 after correcting for multiple testing (S3 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of two significantly burdened genes (at  = 0.0022) from 23 genes is unexpected (p = 0.0011, Binomial(23,0.0022)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ARID1A is a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, a 15 gene complex involved in DNA transcription regulation [37] (see S5 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of this complex are mutated in  greater than 20% of malignancies [3840], but are extremely intolerant to LoF and missense variation [41] (S5 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reviewed SGS results in the Utah HRPs at the location of these 15 genes and identified a borderline genome-wide suggestive segment in pedigree UT-549917 shared by 4 MM cases across 21 meioses (p = 2.17×10-5, S3 Fig and S6 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This 1.5 Mb segment at chr3p21.1-p21.2 (52.0153.56 Mb; hg19) contains 32 genes including PBRM1 from the SWI/SNF complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No coding variants were identified in this gene in UT-549917, nor in the remaining 44 pedigrees/families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Burden testing was significant for 7 of the 15 genes in the complex after correcting for multiple testing: ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCA4, ACTL6A, SMARCD3, SMARCC2, and SMARCE1 (S5 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of seven significantly burdened genes (at  = 0.0033) from 15 genes is unexpected by chance (p = 2.7×1014, Binomial(15,0.0033)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed a novel strategy to identify segregating chromosomal segments shared by subsets of cases in HRPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It focuses on extended HRPs that are singularly powerful to identify significant genetic segregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our strategy allows for genetic heterogeneity within such pedigrees and provides formal significance thresholds for valid interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, extended HRP have not delivered on their potential in complex traits because in common, complex traits, HRPs are likely enriched for multiple susceptibility variants and may capture both familial and sporadic cases in their branches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our optimization strategy over subsets is attractive because it allows for heterogeneity without prior knowledge of genetic similarities or deep phenotyping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new statistic also identifies the sharers and clearly delimits the shared region, making follow-up interrogation straight-forward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a distinct advantage over standard linkage analysis and previous pairwise SGS methods where neither sharers or the region are defined [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Application of the method to extended MM pedigrees demonstrated the utility of this new method and illustrated that the segments identified were used successfully to narrow the search for risk variants in smaller pedigrees, allowing for an overall strategy that can utilize both large pedigrees and smaller families together for discovery (Table 2, Fig 2 and Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post-hoc, additional value can be gained from demographic and/or clinical data on the sharing subsets shedding light on other shared characteristics that may aid future mapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, we note that in the absence of any significant findings, genome-wide SGS results can be used as genomic annotations of segregation evidence for more heuristic approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While we identified several rare, potentially deleterious coding variants of interest, several of the SGS discovery pedigrees had no coding variants that satisfied prioritization criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe this will be characteristic of complex traits and that regulatory variants will also play a substantial role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations with strong causal likelihood found in other disease cohorts may focus the search for regulatory variation to particular genes within a shared segment, as with USP45 in MM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of such compelling evidence, a return to pedigree segregation methods will provide identification of statistically compelling regions which can concentrate efforts to identify and characterize regulatory risk variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work will include targeted sequencing of the promising MM SGS identified to investigate non-coding variants that may play a role in MM risk in these families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our proposed method is a new analytic tool with the potential to reinvigorate the use of extended HRPs in the identification of risk variants that contribute to common, complex disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of the plasma cells that has been shown to be familial [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a role for genetics, case-control studies have been successful in identifying association signals for 17 low-risk variants [4448].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite consistent evidence for familial clustering, our study is the first to explore high-risk MM pedigrees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the unique genealogical database available in Utah, we identified and studied extended MM HRPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a genome-wide significant segment containing USP45, an important regulator of DNA repair (Fig 2 and Table 2), and a genome-wide suggestive segment harboring other genes in the GG-NER incision complex (ERCC1 and ERCC2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exome sequencing in a collaborative resource of high-risk families and early-onset cases revealed four rare, potentially deleterious coding variants; two novel variants in USP45 segregating in two pedigrees and two variants in early-onset cases in ERCC3 and ERCC4, the latter annotated as pathogenic in ClinVar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Burden testing including sporadic MM, and comparing to controls, identified significant enrichment for variants in MM cases in 2 of the 23 GG-NER genes in the protein endonuclease regulation complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In particular, the functional literature supports USP45 as a candidate cancer risk gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  USP45 has been shown to deubiquitylate ERCC1, a catalytic subunit of the ERCC1-ERCC4 DNA repair endonuclease (ERCC4 also known as XPF) [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This endonuclease is a critical regulator of DNA repair processes [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex repairs recombination, double strand break, and inter-strand crosslink by cutting DNA overhangs around a lesion, degrades 3 G-rich overhangs in telomere maintenance, and plays a role in cancer prevention and in tumor resistance to chemotherapy [31,34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse models have shown USP45 knockout cells have higher levels of ubiquitylated ERCC1 and that cells are hypersensitive to UV radiation and DNA inter-strand cross-links, repair of UV-induced DNA damage, and ERCC1 translocation to DNA damage is impaired [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the deubiquitylase activity of USP45 is important for maintaining the DNA repair ability of ERCC1-ERCC4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, these observations implicate the GG-NER incision complex and specifically the interaction of USP45 and the disruption of the ERCC1-ERCC4 role in DNA repair as a mechanism of potential importance in MM risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our strategy also identified shared segments overlapping at chr1p36.11 in two Utah pedigrees containing ARID1A (Fig 3 and Table 2) and a borderline genome-wide suggestive segment in a third pedigree harboring another gene in the SWI/SNF complex (PBRM1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the SWI/SNF complex, exome sequencing revealed two rare, potentially deleterious variants in ARID1A segregating in two pedigrees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Burden testing provided further evidence for enrichment of variants in ARID1A specifically, and in 7 of the 15 genes in the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, ARID1A facilities gene activation by assisting transcription machinery gain access to gene targets [49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the patterns of mutations in tumor cells, ARID1A likely functions as a tumor-suppressor [50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are mutated in 20% of malignancies [38], but are extremely intolerant to LoF and missense variation [41] (S5 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blockage of chromatin remodeling may sustain cancer development [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aberrant chromatin remodeling contributes to the pathogenesis of ovarian clear-cell carcinoma [50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has previously been shown that ARID1A is intolerant to variation (LoF and missense mutations) [28], consistent with its prominent somatic role in multiple tumors [38,50,51], including hematological malignancies [5254].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations implicate the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, and specifically ARID1A in MM risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study has limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the method is applicable only to extended HRPs that are singularly effective for identifying segregating segments (15 meioses between cases is optimal [16]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method is not directly applicable to the many smaller family-based resources that have been gathered in the complex trait field and may therefore result in findings from single large pedigrees that are private and difficult to replicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as illustrated in our example, in a collaborative setting containing both extended HRPs and smaller families, the approach can be mutually beneficial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, our observation of two borderline genome-wide suggestive overlapping segments at 1p36 led to our identification of ARID1A as a potential candidate risk gene and illustrates the potential for discoveries using overlapping subthreshold evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it raises analytical questions of how to systematically identify such segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This segment would have been ignored based on strict individual-pedigree thresholds and highlights an important area for further methodological development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, as in all family-based genetic studies our method is susceptible to inaccurate pedigree structures and poorly matched control populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, relationship and ethnicity checks are standard protocol and mitigate the possibility of error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, this study is observational and cannot describe causation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have identified two complexes, several genes and specific variants as compelling candidates involved in MM risk, but further functional studies will be required to determine and characterize the mechanisms involved in risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we have developed a strategy for gene mapping in complex traits that accounts for heterogeneity within HRPs and formally corrects for multiple testing to allow for statistically rigorous discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied this strategy to MM, a complex cancer of plasma cells, and identified multiple shared segments containing genes in nucleotide excision repair and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exome follow-up supported these segments in both the Utah large HRPs and smaller families from other sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study offers a novel technique for HRP gene mapping and demonstrates its utility to narrow the search for risk-variants in complex traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
