Multiple modality biomarker prediction of cognitive impairment in prospectively followed de novo Parkinson disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Objectives  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the neurobiological substrate of initial cognitive decline in Parkinsons disease (PD) to inform patient management, clinical trial design, and development of treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We longitudinally assessed, up to 3 years, 423 newly diagnosed patients with idiopathic PD, untreated at baseline, from 33 international movement disorder centers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Study outcomes were four determinations of cognitive impairment or decline, and biomarker predictors were baseline dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; volume and thickness), diffusion tensor imaging (mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; amyloid beta [A], tau and alpha synuclein), and 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with PD cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, longitudinal structural MRI and DAT scan data were included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Univariate analyses were run initially, with false discovery rate = 0.2, to select biomarker variables for inclusion in multivariable longitudinal mixed-effect models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By year 3, cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 1538% participants depending on the criteria applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biomarkers, some longitudinal, predicting cognitive impairment in multivariable models were: (1) dopamine deficiency (decreased caudate and putamen DAT availability); (2) diffuse, cortical decreased brain volume or thickness (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe regions); (3) co-morbid Alzheimers disease A amyloid pathology (lower CSF A 142); and (4) genes (COMT val/val and BDNF val/val genotypes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cognitive impairment in PD increases in frequency 50200% in the first several years of disease, and is independently predicted by biomarker changes related to nigrostriatal or cortical dopaminergic deficits, global atrophy due to possible widespread effects of neurodegenerative disease, co-morbid Alzheimers disease plaque pathology, and genetic factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Parkinson disease (PD) cognitive impairment can occur in a range of cognitive domains[1], dementia (PDD) affects up to 80% of patients long-term[2], mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) occurs in 2530% of non-demented patients[1] and is a risk factor for dementia[3], and cognitive deficits are present in some patients at the time of diagnosis[4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A range of demographic and clinical correlates or potential risk factors for cognitive decline have been identified, including increasing age and duration of PD, male sex, specific motor features (postural instability gait disorder [PIGD] subtype), and a range of non-motor symptoms (e.g., visual hallucinations, apathy, depression, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder)[5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cortical Lewy body disease (LBD) pathology appears to be the major contributing pathology to cognitive decline in PD[6], but Alzheimer disease (AD)-related changes are also present in a significant percentage of patients[7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A range of neurotransmitter deficits have been implicated, including in acetylcholine[8], dopamine[9], and norepinephrine systems[10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic influences have been identified in some studies, including apolipoprotein E4 [ApoE4] status[11] and SNPs in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) val66met[12], catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) val158met[13], and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT)[14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, diffuse (primarily medial temporal lobe, parietal lobe and prefrontal cortex) gray matter atrophy and white matter changes have been associated with cognitive decline in PD[15, 16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The research on the neural substrates of the initial stages of cognitive decline in PD, starting with disease onset, are limited, with previous studies often characterized by single site participation, relatively small sample sizes, cross-sectional design, or a limited biomarker assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is an ongoing, prospective, longitudinal, biomarker-rich observational study of disease progression in early PD[17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biomarkers obtained in the PPMI study include dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT imaging, brain structural MRI, CSF and blood biomarkers as well as DNA for genotyping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The goals of these analyses were to evaluate which baseline and longitudinal biomarkers may predict cognitive impairment in early PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Newly diagnosed, untreated PD patients (N = 423) were enrolled in PPMI from June 2010May 2013 out a cohort of 489 screened patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At baseline PD participants were required to: (1) have a recent idiopathic PD diagnosis; (3) be untreated for PD; (4) have a dopamine transporter (DAT) deficit on imaging; and (5) not have dementia as determined by the site investigator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aims and methodology of the study have been published elsewhere[17] and are available at www.ppmi-info.org/study-design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall study was approved by the Research Subjects Review Board at the University of Rochester, and the study was approved by the institutional review board at each site, and participants provided written informed consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical data out to three years post-baseline was utilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data was downloaded on September 21, 2015; at the time of data download 38 PD patients had discontinued study participation (9.0% discontinuation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participant_characteristics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for all PD participants (N = 423) are in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cohort is approximately two-thirds male, overwhelmingly white, and highly educated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The characteristics for the subset of participants with MRI data (N = 160) was similar to that of the full population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 2 lists the number of PD participants with biomarker availability at each time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic, CSF, and DTI testing was done at baseline, and DAT imaging and MRI thickness and volumes at baseline, year 1 and year 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cognitive_outcomes_over_time  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cognitive assessments were available for up to 423 participants at baseline, 395 at year 1, 376 at year 2, and 239 at year 3 (dropout rate less_than10%, so the decreasing number of participants over time is largely due to the fact that many participants had not yet reached year 3 of study participation at the time of data download).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over the 3-year period the mean MoCA score declined by approximately 1 point on average, and the frequency of participants screening positive for cognitive impairment (i.e., MoCA score less_than26) increased from 22% to 37%, with dementia-level impairment (i.e., MoCA score less_than21[20]) increasing from 1% to 6% over time, see Table 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cognitive impairment increased from 11% to 15% based on detailed neuropsychological test results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the site investigators diagnostic determination, the diagnosis of MCI increased from 9% to 21% and PDD from 0% to 3%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this multi-modal longitudinal examination of predictors of cognitive impairment in early PD, the biomarkers in general predicting cognitive impairment that remained significant in multivariable models were: (1) dopamine deficiency; (2) brain-wide decreased volume or thickness; (3) white matter tract abnormalities; (4) possible co-morbid AD pathology; and (5) genetic SNPs summarized in S4 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By year three after PD diagnosis, cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 1537% participants and increased in frequency by 50200% over this time period depending on the criteria applied, consistent with the relatively high frequency[4, 31] and worsening over time[32] reported in other early PD cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There were no biological predictors of neuropsychological test-defined impairment; one possible explanation is that the smallest percentage of participants fulfilled this criterion for cognitive impairment over time (15% versus either 24% or 37% for the other criteria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greatest evidence for biomarkers predicting cognitive decline in this early, relatively cognitively intact population occurred when using the site investigators annual diagnosis of cognitive impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that both caudate and putamen DAT deficits, either at disease onset or worsening over time, predicted cognitive impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confirms previous cross-sectional and longitudinal research in early PD using DAT[33] or other striatal dopamine system imaging ligands[34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that enhancing dopamine function in early PD might improve cognitive abilities, at least acutely or temporarily[35], and that serial DAT imaging might serve as a cognitive biomarker in PD cognition studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lower CSF A 142 levels, suggestive of co-morbid AD A amyloid brain deposition, have been associated with memory impairment in de novo PD patients[31] and as well as future cognitive decline[36, 37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AD pathology is associated with increasing age in PD, but here an association was shown between cognitive impairment and baseline A 142 levels, when the mean age of patients was only 62 years, suggesting that AD-related changes in PD can occur at a relatively young age and long prior to the development of dementia, as reported for MCI in the general population[38] and in preliminary PD neuropathological studies[39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple, widely spread brain regions of decreased volume, and to a lesser extent thickness, predicted cognitive impairment, and for some brain regions cognitive impairment was predicted by ongoing atrophy, including frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobe regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings overlap with previous findings of temporal-parietal and frontal atrophy and thinning with MCI in early PD [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the cortical atrophy observed in vivo using structural MRI is associated with cortical PD- or AD-related neuropathological changes, which would be consistent with neuropathology studies showing that both cortical LBD pathology and co-morbid A amyloid plaque deposits are associated with cognitive impairment in PD[41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specific brain regions (associated cognitive function) implicated included the lateral occipital (object recognition and spatial vision), lateral orbitofrontal (executive abilities), and entorhinal (memory) cortices, subserving cognitive abilities that can be impaired early in the course of PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter finding is consistent with recent research that medial temporal lobe atrophy is associated with cognitive impairment and decline in non-demented PD patients[42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neither increased MD nor decreased FA predicted cognitive impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous research in de novo PD reported an association between increased MD in frontal and parietal white matter tracts and specific cognitive tests[43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cohort and study design differences may in part explain these discrepant findings, but the analyses performed here were more stringent than those utilized in previous research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two SNPs associated with cognitive decline, the COMT val158met SNP and BDNF val66met.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a complex association between the COMT val158met SNP and cognition in PD, influenced by both disease severity and use of dopaminergic medication[44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our analyses, the high activity COMT val158met genotype was associated with cognitive impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding BDNF, its product is important for survival and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study found that the BDNF val-allele carriers had great decline in executive abilities over time, consistent with our findings [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike some previous studies, we did not show an association between ApoE4 or MAPT status and cognitive impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ApoE4, it is important to note that most previous studies have focused on PD patients with dementia[46], and the PPMI sample is relatively young and cognitively intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For MAPT, the H1 haplotype has been associated with cognitive decline or dementia in some[47] but not all[11] PD studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longer duration of follow up of this cohort will unveil if genetic risks are important in later-onset or more advanced cognitive dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strengths of the study are inclusion of multiple and international sites; the relatively large sample size; inclusion of multiple biomarkers, including some obtained serially; enrollment of participants starting at symptom onset; annual cognitive and clinical assessments; use of four definitions of cognitive impairment; and a stringent, multi-step statistical analysis plan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limitations include: highly educated and overwhelmingly white cohort limiting generalizability; variable sample sizes for the different biomarkers, with less than half the patients having research quality MRI scans for inclusion; although CSF is collected serially in PPMI, currently only baseline values are available; the cognitive battery utilized in PPMI is limited and the site investigators diagnosis of cognitive impairment was available for the entire cohort only starting at year two; other biomarkers associated with early cognitive decline in PD (e.g., measures of cholinergic integrity and FDG-PET) are not included in PPMI; and lack of comparison with the healthy controls enrolled in PPMI to assess the disease specificity of our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cognitive decline in early PD is independently predicted by multiple biomarker changes, including nigrostriatal dopamine system deficits, wide-ranging atrophy consistent with cortical neurodegenerative disease, evidence for co-morbid AD pathology, and genetic factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides confirmation for heterogeneity in the neural substrate of the early cognitive deficits in PD, and highlights the need to incorporate multiple biomarkers when risk factors for cognitive decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Validation and extension of these findings will help in the design of clinical trials for cognitive impairment in PD, including those testing possible disease-modifying therapies from disease onset, and also be a step toward personalized medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
