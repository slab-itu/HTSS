The Role of Compassion in Altruistic Helping and Punishment Behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compassion, the emotional response of caring for another who is suffering and that results in motivation to relieve suffering, is thought to be an emotional antecedent to altruistic behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains unclear whether compassion enhances altruistic behavior in a uniform way or is specific to sub-types of behavior such as altruistic helping of a victim or altruistic punishment of a transgressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated the relationship between compassion and subtypes of altruistic behavior using third-party paradigms where participants 1) witnessed an unfair economic exchange between a transgressor and a victim, and 2) had the opportunity to either spend personal funds to either economically a) help the victim or b) punish the transgressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Study 1, we examined whether individual differences in self-reported empathic concern (the emotional component of compassion) was associated with greater altruistic helping or punishment behavior in two independent samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For participants who witnessed an unfair transaction, trait empathic concern was associated with greater helping of a victim and had no relationship to punishment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in those who decided to punish the transgressor, participants who reported greater empathic concern decided to punish less.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Study 2, we directly enhanced compassion using short-term online compassion meditation training to examine whether altruistic helping and punishment were increased after two weeks of training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to an active reappraisal training control group, the compassion training group gave more to help the victim and did not differ in punishment of the transgressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these two studies suggest that compassion is related to greater altruistic helping of victims and is not associated with or may mitigate altruistic punishment of transgressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

General_Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cultivating altruistic and cooperative behavior among diverse individuals and communities is a challenge for our increasingly interconnected society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A growing body of literature is demonstrating that compassion meditation training can promote altruistic behavior among strangers [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compassion is thought to increase altruistic behavior through the emotional response of caring for and wanting to relieve suffering [46], and compassion meditation trainings aim to cultivate responses of compassion when encountering suffering through contemplative practices and cognitive restructuring [79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known whether compassion training uniformly enhance many types of altruistic behavior or may be targeting specific kinds of altruism such as helping or punishment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contemplative traditions from which many compassion trainings are derived posit that any action can be motivated by compassion [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both basic science and intervention studies of compassion have mostly investigated the impact on altruistic helping behaviors towards victims [1,2,4,6], but less is known about the impact of compassion training on altruistic punishment of transgressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to identify which types of altruistic behavior compassion training can impact in order to optimally administer and implement trainings in targeted and context-appropriate ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Enhancing altruism has many potential benefits because altruistic behavior has positive effects on mental and physical health [1114] as well as economic and societal growth [15,16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altruistic behavior is inherently social and involves an individual using personal resources to impact another individual or group [11,16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Personal resources given to those in need can include instrumental social support (e.g., financial assistance), informational social support (e.g., providing information to help another cope), and emotional social support (e.g., expressing empathy and caring) [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Social support may benefit both the giver and receiver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals who give instrumental social support show a decreased mortality rate, even when controlling for demographic, personality, health, mental health, and marital-relationship variables [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  People report feeling more happiness after spending money for someone else rather than themselves [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals who receive social support show improved mental and physical health (such as decreased depression and improved immune functioning) because they are more protected from the negative effects of stress [11,14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Societal benefits may also occur through altruistic behavior that involves punishment, where personal resources are used to negatively impact those who have transgressed against others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altruistic punishment may be a mechanism through which social norms, or what constitutes appropriate behavior within groups, are enforced [15,16,18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Social norms aim to foster social peace, stabilize cooperation and enhance prosperity [15], and violation of cooperation and egalitarian distribution norms evoke altruistic punishment behaviors [16,18,19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a public goods game, the introduction of altruistic punishment of defectors increases cooperation over repeated interactions where the lack of punishment leads to less cooperation over time [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those who are future-oriented in a delay discounting task and punish in the Ultimatum Game may be punishing to enforce transgressors future cooperative behavior [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  People are motivated to punish players who make unfair offers towards themselves [16,18] as well as others (called third party punishment [16,19]), even at a personal cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further suggesting that altruistic punishment may serve to enforce social norms, punishment increases as unfair offers increase [18,19], and when unfair offers are rejected in the Ultimatum Game, proposers make more fair offers in subsequent rounds of play [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that people are motivated to altruistically punish to enforce social norms such as cooperation and fairness, and that punishment does indeed result in more prosocial actions in those who were punished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Punishment may also serve antisocial motives such as competitive spite [21,22], and prosocial motives of punishment may be distinguished from antisocial motives through observing fairness of behavior played in other roles (such as the dictator in Dictator Game [21] and the proposer in the Ultimatum Game [22]) or punishment of cooperative players [23,24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prosocially-motivated punishment in this way can be viewed as an altruistic behavior that ultimately helps others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to develop interventions that cultivate prosocial behaviors, it is important to understand both the emotions that lead to different types of altruistic behavior and the contextual factors that will promote the emotions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, emotions such as empathy and compassion have been studied as antecedents of helping behavior [4,5,25], and negative emotions such as anger and annoyance has been studied as antecedents of punishment behavior [18,19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, compassion may be theoretically linked to both altruistic helping and punishment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compassion as a naturally occurring emotion has been defined as having both an emotional and motivational component when encountering another person suffer, where the emotional component is one of caring and concern for someones suffering (also called empathic concern), and the motivational component includes the desire to help relieve suffering [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this definition, it is clear how compassion would lead to altruistic helping of a victim.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, studies show a link between the emotional state of compassion and the subsequent reported intentions of helping [25] or actual helping behavior [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although it is less conceptually clear that compassion would influence altruistic punishment, there are several reasons why compassion may impact punishment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, contemplative traditions emphasize that the motivation of the action is what is important rather than the action itself [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that punishment could be motivated by compassion to help the victim, the perpetrator, or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If transgressors who violate fairness norms are financially punished, they are less likely to transgress in future interactions [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By deciding to punish, third parties may help protect future potential victims and also provide valuable feedback to the transgressors regarding the social acceptability of their behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, if the transgressor is also viewed as a person who is suffering, compassion may lead to less punishment and other pathways to responding to the transgressor may emerge, as is seen in restorative justice systems [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One study showed that inducing compassion towards one stranger is associated with decreased punishment towards a separate transgressor [27]; however, it is unclear whether compassion towards the transgressor would yield a similar result, and punishment was not costly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another study demonstrated that greater trait levels of the emotional component of compassion (empathic concern [28]) predicted greater costly altruistic redistribution of funds from a dictator who shared an unfair amount of money to the anonymous victim [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in this study altruistic helping of the victim and punishment of the transgressor were confounded, so it is unclear whether trait empathic concern motivated helping, punishment, or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To clarify this issue, we tested the relationship between compassion and altruistic helping and punishment behavior in two studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Study 1, we tested whether the emotional component of compassion (measured by self-reported trait empathic concern) is associated with altruistic helping and/or punishment behavior in response to an unfair economic exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Study 2, we tested whether direct enhancement of compassion through short-term compassion training would impact altruistic helping and punishment behavior measured after training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure altruistic behavior, we used paradigms from behavioral economics because they provide powerful tools to study instrumental social support [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compassion and altruistic behavior are socially desirable qualities, and they are highly susceptible to demand characteristics [3,30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, participants in social psychological studies of compassion and helping behavior often report a desire to help but not are required to act on that help at the conclusion of the experiment [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using behavioral economic paradigms address some of these methodological concerns by studying social behavior through computerized anonymous one-shot interactions [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This minimizes the effects of demand characteristics and reputation effects because participants play with live players in the laboratory only once and do not know which players they are interacting with at any given time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, any economic decisions participants make directly impact their monetary compensation, decreasing the likelihood they are acting solely to maintain their reputation in front of peers or experimenters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Economic paradigms may have less ecological validity compared to real-world social interactions due to these design elements; however, this tightly-controlled method of specifying and measuring social behavior allows us to make more concrete conclusions about the relationship between emotional traits and types of altruistic behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used third-party altruistic paradigms [19] to measure altruistic punishment and helping behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third-party paradigms are useful for studying compassionately-motivated behavior because they involve 1) witnessing an unfair economic interaction between a dictator and a victim (a model of suffering or unfair treatment) and 2) the opportunity for the participant to altruistically spend personal funds to impact another player such as punishing the dictator [19], helping the victim, or redistributing funds from the dictator to the victim [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Study 1, we administered the third-party altruistic helping and punishment paradigms in two separate samples, and determined the extent to which the emotional component of compassion (self-reported trait empathic concern) was associated with altruistic behavior in the games.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Study 2, we tested whether direct enhancement of compassion through short-term compassion training would increase altruistic helping and/or punishment behavior compared to a cognitive reappraisal control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compassion meditation training stems from Buddhist philosophy and contemplative traditions, and some Buddhist conceptualizations of compassion are in alignment with the Western psychological definition stated earlier [6], where it is described as being moved by anothers suffering and resulting in a desire to relieve the persons suffering [7,9] (however, see [31] for an alternate conceptualization of compassion which views it as dispositionally enactive and as a contingent and emergent process).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compassion meditation practices aim to enhance compassionate responses towards the suffering of the self and others using a variety of techniques such as visualization practices, repeating compassion-generating phrases (such as, May you be free from suffering and May you be safe), bodily awareness, and cognitive education in Buddhist philosophy [2,9,32,33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compassion may be generated towards different people such as a loved one, the self, a stranger, and a difficult person with whom there is conflict, and towards all people [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compassion training typically trains balanced awareness to stimuli of suffering, enhancing emotional compassionate feelings towards those who are suffering, and enhancing the motivation to relieve suffering [2,3,9,33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These practices may be conducted while in a sitting position as well as during walking meditation (e.g., offering wishes and phrases of compassion for others while walking) [2,9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that within the context of altruistic punishment, generating compassion for a difficult person is conceptually aligned with practicing compassion for a transgressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies of compassion training have mostly investigated the relationship between compassion and altruistic helping behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A one-day compassion training (6 hours total) conducted with 28 women resulted in greater helping behavior in the Zurich Prosocial Game compared to 32 women in a memory training group [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From pre- to post-training, the compassion-trained group were more helpful to another player in the computerized Zurich Prosocial Game compared to the control group, both when it was costly and non-costly for themselves [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another study, both 8 weeks of compassion (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training; 16 hours total) and mindfulness training (meditation practices that trained nonjudgmental awareness without a focus on compassion) resulted in greater prosocial behavior towards an injured confederate stranger compared to a wait-list control [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some researchers theorize that compassion should enhance cooperative behaviors whereas fairness-based norms should motivate punishment, and acknowledge that empirical research is needed to test these hypotheses [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our group found that short-term compassion training (7 hours total over 2 weeks) increases third-party altruistic redistribution, which is a combination of both third-party punishment and helping [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because the two behaviors were combined, it is unclear whether compassion influences the punishment or helping components of third-party altruism or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term practitioners of compassion meditation were found to punish less when given an unfair split themselves, and punished equivalently when viewing another receive an unfair split compared to a control group [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were also given the opportunity to recompensate the victim who received the unfair split, and spent more to aid the victim compared to the control group [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that compassion may be less likely to impact (or may even mitigate) retributive punishment behavior and may enhance helping behaviors that restore equity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the cross-sectional design using long-term practitioners, differences in behavior cannot be purely isolated to compassion meditation practice and may be due to other lifestyle factors such as other contemplative practices or living in a retreat setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Study 2, we directly trained healthy participants in compassion using a randomized control design in order to make stronger claims about the relationship between compassion and altruistic helping and punishment behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we investigated the relationship between compassion and altruistic helping and punishment using third-party economic paradigms by testing the relationships 1) as they naturally occur in the general population and 2) by directly influencing compassion through compassion training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Study 1, we recruited participants from the general population to investigate whether trait empathic concern (the emotional component of compassion) was associated with third-party altruistic helping or punishment after witnessing an unfair or fair interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested whether altruistic behavior was associated with trait negative affect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Study 2, we investigated whether directly enhancing compassion through short-term online compassion training [3] would increase altruistic punishment or helping compared to a cognitive reappraisal control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These games were administered in the same population as a previous study of compassion training that found increases in altruistic redistribution and neural responses to human suffering [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the emotional component of compassion, or the tendency to feel warmth, caring, and concern for those who are suffering, does not uniformly impact altruistic behavior but is specific to promoting altruistic helping of a victim and not altruistic punishment of a transgressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Helping Game, individuals who reported more trait empathic concern spent more funds to directly help the victim who was treated unfairly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Punishment Game, there was no relationship between empathic concern and punishment within the entire sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the participants who decided to punish at all (Punishers), the ones who endorsed greater empathic concern were the ones who punished the least.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this relationship was driven by Antisocial Punishers, who behaved unfairly when playing as the dictator (within the context of the third-party punishment game) and punished unfair dictators themselves when playing as the third party.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This set of findings suggest that general feelings of empathic concern towards those who are in need are indeed associated with acting on those feelings and helping someone who is treated unfairly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, general feelings of empathic concern do not appear to be related to punishment of a transgressor overall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However in those who decide to punish (particularly in those who demonstrate antisocial behavior as the dictator), trait empathic concern may mitigate the degree to which they punish, and this may balance competing motivations to discourage the transgressor from future violations of the fairness norm while not being overly punitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is similar to other studies that suggest that compassion decreases punishment when another [27] or the self [35] is transgressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies should examine whether compassion may be positively associated with punishment in larger samples of Prosocial Punishers, those who are prosocially-motivated as indicated by fair/generous behavior played in other roles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prosocial and Antisocial Punishers can be more cleanly identified in future studies by administering the third-party punishment game in conjunction with the dictator game.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The emotional component of compassion may impact altruistic behavior that involves any component of helping, even if the helping behavior is coupled with punishment (as in the Redistribution Game).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the data suggest that empathic concern impacts altruistic helping and redistribution similarly, but more data may be needed to detect statistical differences (the empathic concern-redistribution relationship was marginally significantly greater than the empathic concern-helping behavior relationship when the extreme altruists in the helping game were included).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The helping and redistribution behaviors have fundamentally different economic and social outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Redistribution impacts the transgressor while helping does not, and because it impacts both parties simultaneously, it is a behavioral representation of justice that has both a monetary and psychological impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Redistribution mathematically decreases inequality between the dictator and recipient at twice the rate as helping or punishment, and further studies are needed to determine whether this difference impacts the relationship with compassion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, for some participants, it may be psychologically desirable to impact both players after an unfair interaction in order to both help the victim as well as negatively reinforce the dictator to discourage future transgressions (and protect future victims).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trait negative emotions did not impact altruistic helping, punishment, or redistribution behavior after an unfair transaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is somewhat counter to previous findings that negative emotions such as anger positively predict altruistic punishment [19,35,41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, negative emotions were measured at the trait rather than state level, and the measure assessed many different types of negative emotions rather than isolating specific states that may be more associated with punishment (such as anger and annoyance).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, trait negative emotions did positively predict greater punishment and redistribution after a fair or generous dictator transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is surprising that participants would be motivated to spend personal funds to punish a stranger who acted fairly because it is economically costly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous research has shown that few people punish after a fair split and most participants do not believe players will punish in that case [19], although antisocial punishment of prosocial players varies widely across societies [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants may receive other psychological benefits from antisocial punishment that justifies the expense, and this may be associated with experiencing negative emotions on a regular basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study found that other factors may reliably predict altruistic behavior and should be taken into consideration in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Economists state that decisions are not due to reputation effects in one-shot games because the interactions are anonymous and participants only interact once [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our data demonstrated that social desirability was a significant predictor of altruistic behavior in both Punishment and Redistribution Games, and previous work shows this effect is driven by interacting with other live players rather than playing in isolation [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, only games that involved punishment of the dictator were associated with social desirability, and this suggests that it may be socially desirable to punish norm-violators rather than to help victims.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third-party behavior in the Helping Game was highly correlated with participants behavior while playing as the Dictator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, more unique variance in helping behavior was associated with behavior while playing as the Dictator than with trait compassion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that altruistic helping may largely reflect a general desire to be prosocial, independent of the context of first witnessing an unfair interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Future work should also directly measure the motivational component of compassion (perhaps through the CLS or DPES) to determine whether the emotional and motivational components of compassion contribute unique variance to enacted altruistic behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains challenging to distinctly measure empathic concern and motivation to help, and motivation to help is often inferred from observable altruistic behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that some people may have the desire to help but may not act on that desire for a variety of reasons, and further research should understand how this disconnect between motivation and action may occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, it is unclear how behavior in controlled economic decision-making paradigms, which provide crisp models of measuring altruistic behavior, is related to altruistic behavior in real-world scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More research is needed to understand the relationship between behavior in these games to behavior in everyday life (e.g., helping a friend or giving negative feedback to a coworker) in order to understand the applicability of results from these paradigms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Study_2__Compassion_Training_Study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After only two weeks of training, individuals who practiced Compassion Training were more willing to altruistically help (Compassion mean rank = 19.0 or $1.14, Reappraisal mean rank = 12.8 or $0.61, t28 = 2.29, p less_than 0.05) compared to those who practiced Reappraisal Training (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Helping Game, compassion trainees spent 1.87 times more money than reappraisal trainees in order to altruistically help the recipient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants trained in compassion increased equality between the dictator and recipient by 29%, whereas those trained in reappraisal only increased the equality by 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compassion Training did not influence behavior in the Punishment Game compared to Reappraisal Training (Fig 3; t39 = 0.91, p = 0.37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to estimate whether compassion training may have increased helping and punishment behaviors compared to a pre-training level, training group means were compared to the means of the participants who did not go through training (No Training group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Helping Game, the Compassion Training group gave a similar amount compared to the No Training group (Compassion mean rank = 70.15, No Training mean rank = 61.49, t1,100 = 0.91, p = 0.36), whereas the Reappraisal Training group gave significantly less than the No Training group (Reappraisal mean rank = 44.41, No Training mean rank = 61.49, t1,104 = -2.00, p less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Compassion Training group was still found to be more altruistic than the Reappraisal Training group in the Helping Game when comparing the newly computed ranks derived from combining the samples from Studies 1 and 2 (p less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Punishment Game (full sample and Punishers only), no group differed in punishment behavior from any other group (all ps  0.26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


General_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study demonstrated that after two weeks of training, compassion training resulted in more altruistic helping of an anonymous victim but not punishment of a transgressor compared to reappraisal training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that a previous finding that compassion training increases altruistic redistribution [3], which is a combination of altruistic helping and punishment, is driven more by the helping than the punishment component of redistribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are supported by a previous study that demonstrated that long-term practitioners of compassion meditation spent more to recompensate a victim but did not differ from controls in how much they punished a transgressor who was unfair to another player [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, these findings are not completely clear because when comparing responses in the Helping Game to a sample with no training, it appears that the difference between the compassion and reappraisal groups are driven by reappraisal training decreasing helping behavior rather than compassion training increasing it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result should be considered preliminary because the altruistic helping paradigm was added later to the training protocol, and the N was lower compared to the punishment game (Helping N = 30, Punishment N = 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, helping and punishment games were administered after the redistribution game, and results may be more clean if the games are administered independently of each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A limitation of the study is that the economic games were only administered post-training, and although we accounted for this by comparing training group responses to samples with no training, future studies can clarify the directionality of helping behavior through compassion training by administering games both pre- and post-training and having sufficient power to detect differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, it appears that compassion training has no impact on punishment behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further research is needed to determine whether compassion training would mitigate punishment behavior in Punishers, as shown in the sample with no training from Study 1 (the Punisher sample size was not large enough within the training sample to fully address this question).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although altruistic punishment is a behavior that appears to help enforce social norms and protect the well-being of other group members, these data suggest that compassion training may not have a direct influence on third-party punishment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To clarify the impact of compassion training on altruistic behavior from pre- to post-training, future studies should use paradigms that are validated for longitudinal study designs [2] or test altruistic behavior using multiple trials of varying offers [16,35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is also unclear what component(s) of the compassion training may be impacting altruistic behavior, and how much the qualities being trained in Study 2 are similar to or different from what trait empathic concern is measuring in Study 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the compassion training study, participants practiced enhancing both the emotional and motivational components of compassion, as well as learned to have a more balanced response to others suffering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unclear which of these components (or all) were tied to the changes in altruistic helping or redistribution behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the samples with no training, we only assessed the emotional component of compassion (empathic concern) to predict altruistic behavior, and future studies should assess additional components of compassion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the qualities impacted by compassion training are not necessarily the same construct that trait empathic concern is assessing in the general population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This issue can be aided by developing compassion questionnaires that are conceptualized from a Buddhist contemplative framework, and to use additional measures that may be more sensitive to detecting these different constructs such as psychophysiology or neuroimaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, although compassion training is likely increasing the tendency to respond with caring and wanting to help those who are suffering, because the training is only two weeks long, it is unlikely that this tendency would be sustained with time without continued practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research should examine the sustained effect of compassion training on altruistic behavior through longitudinal studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, it is worth noting that the intention of these studies is not to determine the correct way to behaviorally express a compassionate motivation, but rather to identify general patterns in the data that will help match compassion trainings to relevant causes and populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if compassion training specifically targets altruistic helping rather than punishment, it would be particularly relevant to implement compassion training to professionals who engage in helping those who are suffering (e.g., doctors and psychotherapists).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further research is needed to determine whether compassion training may be useful for professions that include sanctions such as law enforcement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to contemplative traditions, the intention behind the action is as critical as the action itself [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this perspective, punishment could arise from a compassionate motivation as much as helping behavior, and more nuanced experimental designs are needed to measure punishment that may arise from a compassionate stance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data from Study 1 suggest that compassion can decrease the amount of punishment given for those who choose to punish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Punishment decisions are contextual and involve integrating a number of factors including the intent of the transgressor and the severity of harm [15], and adopting a compassionate view towards those who violate societal norms may be beneficial for identifying optimal ways to rehabilitate offenders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More research is needed to examine the impact of compassion training on altruistic acts within tightly-controlled experimental paradigms as well as more complex real-world scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interventions can therefore be targeted to specific populations and contexts in order to improve interactions and social health in our increasingly diverse and interconnected society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
