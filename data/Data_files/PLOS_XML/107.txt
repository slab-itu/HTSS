Calcium Regulation of Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Budding: Mechanistic Implications for Host-Oriented Therapeutic Intervention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hemorrhagic fever viruses, including the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) and arenaviruses (Lassa and Junín viruses), are serious human pathogens for which there are currently no FDA approved therapeutics or vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, transmission of these viruses, and specifically late steps of budding, critically depend upon host cell machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, strategies which target these mechanisms represent potential targets for broad spectrum host oriented therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important cellular signal implicated previously in EBOV budding is calcium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, host cell calcium signals are increasingly being recognized to play a role in steps of entry, replication, and transmission for a range of viruses, but if and how filoviruses and arenaviruses mobilize calcium and the precise stage of virus transmission regulated by calcium have not been defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that expression of matrix proteins from both filoviruses and arenaviruses triggers an increase in host cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration by a mechanism that requires host Orai1 channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrate that Orai1 regulates both VLP and infectious filovirus and arenavirus production and spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, suppression of the protein that triggers Orai activation (Stromal Interaction Molecule 1, STIM1) and genetic inactivation or pharmacological blockade of Orai1 channels inhibits VLP and infectious virus egress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are highly significant as they expand our understanding of host mechanisms that may broadly control enveloped RNA virus budding, and they establish Orai and STIM1 as novel targets for broad-spectrum host-oriented therapeutics to combat these emerging BSL-4 pathogens and potentially other enveloped RNA viruses that bud via similar mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg viruses) and arenaviruses (Lassa and Junín viruses) are high-priority pathogens that hijack host proteins and pathways to complete their replication cycles and spread from cell to cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence to demonstrate that the host calcium channel protein Orai1 and ER calcium sensor protein STIM1 regulate efficient budding and spread of BSL-4 pathogens Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and Junín viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are of broad significance as they provide new mechanistic insight into fundamental, immutable, and conserved mechanisms of hemorrhagic fever virus pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this strategy of targeting highly conserved host cellular protein(s) and mechanisms required by these viruses to complete their life cycle should elicit minimal drug resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is an urgent and unmet need for safe and effective therapeutics against high priority pathogens, including filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) and arenaviruses (Lassa fever and Junín), which can cause fatal infections in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We and others have established that enveloped RNA viruses, including hemorrhagic fever viruses, exhibit a common requirement for host pathways, most notably ESCRT pathway functions, for efficient budding [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed as host dependent budding mechanisms are highly conserved within and sometimes across virus families, they represent innovative and immutable antiviral targets for inhibiting virus transmission and disease progression [811].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, high mutation rates of RNA viruses in general are a factor in their ability to develop resistance to therapeutics that target specific viral proteins or functions [3, 1223].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, strategies that target specific host mechanisms required by viruses should reduce the development of resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a number of these host mechanisms, including steps in ESCRT protein function, are targets of calcium regulation, the focus of this study was to determine whether and how hemorrhagic fever viruses mobilize calcium in host cells and whether calcium so mobilized regulates virus budding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we reveal a novel and fundamental requirement for host STIM1- and Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry that regulates late steps of filovirus and arenavirus egress from mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orai activation is typically linked to either tyrosine kinase or G-protein coupled receptors that activate phospholipase C (PLC) and generate diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphoshate (IP3) from membrane phospholipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IP3 activates receptor/channels on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to allow Ca2+ to exit from the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent drop in ER Ca2+ below the KD (400600M, [24]) for the N-terminal EF hands of the ER membrane-resident protein STIM1 initiates a conformational change that promotes STIM1 oligomerization and localization to ER regions adjacent to the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the plasma membrane, STIM1 interacts with and activates Calcium-Release Activated Calcium (CRAC) channels through which extracellular Ca2+ enters the cell (reviewed in [25]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRAC channels are encoded by the Orai family of proteins (Orai1, 2, & 3; [2628]) that provide a pathway for sustained extracellular Ca2+ entry to regulate a range of cell functions including gene expression, subcellular trafficking, and the regulation of cell shape and motility [2931].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Herein, we demonstrate that both filovirus (VP40) and arenavirus (Z) matrix proteins trigger Orai dependent Ca2+ entry in mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, suppression of STIM1 expression and genetic inactivation or pharmacological blockade of Orai inhibits Ebolavirus (EBOV), Marburgvirus (MARV), Lassa Virus (LASV), and Junín Virus (JUNV) VLP and infectious virion production and transmission in cell culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data establish a novel and critical role for STIM1- and Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry in late steps of hemorrhagic fever virus egress and establish STIM1 and Orai inhibitors as potential broad-spectrum anti-viral targets for regulation of these and possibly other enveloped RNA viruses that bud by similar mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Viral_VP40_and_Z_matrix_protein_expression_mobilizes_cytoplasmic_Ca2+  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While we previously implicated Ca2+ in EBOV VP40-dependent VLP generation [32] our initial objective here was to understand if and how hemorrhagic fever virus matrix proteins trigger a change in cytosolic calcium in host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this we measured intracellular calcium in cells during an extended time course of EBOV and MARV VP40 (eVP40 and mVP40, respectively) and JUNV Z matrix protein-mediated VLP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calcium levels (R-GECO-1 fluorescence, [33]) measured in HEK293T cells under physiological conditions for 1824 hours revealed that eVP40, mVP40, and JUNV Z protein expression each induced a time-dependent increase in Ca2+ concentration (Fig 1, blue), while the GFP-vector backbone induced a negligible Ca2+ increase that plateaued at a low amplitude or declined to baseline levels (Fig 1, magenta).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the role of Orai1 in these responses we performed identical measurements in an HEK293T line that stably expresses a dominant negative mutant Orai1 having a glutamic acid (E) to alanine (A) substitution in its ion selectivity filter (E106A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporation of even a single Orai1 E106A subunit into endogenous WT Orai channels exerts a dominant negative block of its Ca2+ permeation [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, both WT and E106A Orai HEK293T cells exhibited a similar transient Ca2+ elevation following treatment with the membrane permeant SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin in Ca2+ free bath solution, indicating that ER stores were intact in E106A Orai1 expressing HEK293T (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of a secondary increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ (S1 Fig, left panel) following reperfusion of HEK293T Orai1 E106A cells with Ca2+-containing Ringers solution (S1 Fig, right panel) verified the Orai permeation defect of this line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, in permeation defective Orai1 E106A cells neither eVP40, mVP40, JUNV Z protein (Fig 1, yellow), nor GFP vector (Fig 1, orange) triggered any change in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels indicating that Ca2+ elevations initiated by expression of EBOV, MARV, and JUNV matrix proteins required and resulted from Ca2+ entry though Orai channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these results from Orai E106A HEK293T cells and specifically the role of Orai, the Orai inhibitor Synta66 similarly blocked the eVP40-mediated increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Fig 1, lower right panel) in WT HEK293T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Orai1_regulates_filovirus_and_arenavirus_VLP_production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the ability of EBOV, MARV, and JUNV matrix proteins to initiate an Orai-dependent Ca2+ signal in HEK293T cells, we assessed the role of Orai1-mediated calcium signals in eVP40, mVP40, LASV Z or JUNV Z mediated VLP production in WT and Orai1 E106A HEK293T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a role for Ca2+ entry via Orai1 in VLP production, we found that Orai1 E106A cells did not support efficient filovirus or arenavirus VLP production (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, levels of eVP40 VLPs from Orai1 E106A cells were ~50 fold lower than that from WT cells (Fig 2A, VLPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, production of mVP40 VLPs exhibited an even greater dependence on Orai1-mediated calcium entry (Fig 2B, VLPs), as mVP40 VLPs from Orai1 E106A HEK293T cells were ~100 fold lower than that from WT cells (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orai similarly regulated JUNV Z (Fig 2C) and LASV Z (Fig 2D) VLP production as both JUNV Z and LASV Z protein-mediated VLP production from E106A cells was ~100 fold lower than that from WT HEK293T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all instances, cellular levels of VP40 or Z were similar in WT and E106A cells, indicating no general requirement for Orai1-mediated Ca2+ entry in viral protein expression (Fig 2A2D; Cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data point to a conserved and selective role for Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry in hemorrhagic fever virus budding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

STIM1_expression_is_required_for_eVP40_VLP_egress  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Implicit in this common critical role for Orai1-mediated Ca2+ entry in EBOV, MARV, JUNV, and LASV VLP production is an upstream requirement for STIM1, the only known trigger for Orai activation in mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STIM1 is a single pass ER membrane protein whose activity is regulated by ER Ca2+ binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ dissociation from STIM1 following a decrease in ER concentration triggers a N-terminal conformational change that initiates its multimerization and relocalization within the ER membrane to domains juxtaposed to the plasma membrane [3537].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting subplasmalemmal STIM1 clusters physically activate Orai channels to allow extracellular Ca2+ to enter the cell [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using eVP40 VLP budding as our model, we probed the role of STIM1 in VLP formation by assessing VLP production from STIM1 suppressed HEK293T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  eVP40 VLP budding from STIM1 suppressed cells was reduced by approximately 10 fold relative to that from cells receiving random siRNAs or no siRNA (Fig 3A), and the loss of STIM1 had no effect on cellular expression of eVP40 or actin (Fig 3A; Cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm this requirement for STIM1 in VLP formation, we utilized a bicistronic vector to suppress endogenous STIM1 (by targeting the 5 UTR) and rescued its expression with exogenous human STIM1 translated from a shRNA resistant cDNA (shSTIM1-STIM1 plasmid) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEK293T WT cells expressing a fixed amount of eVP40 were transfected with increasing amounts of the shSTIM1-suppression vector or empty vector (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While cellular eVP40 expression levels were equivalent under all conditions (Fig 3B, Cells), progressive suppression of STIM1 expression led to a dose-dependent decrease in eVP40 VLP production (Fig 3B, VLPs, middle panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, STIM1 re-expression in suppressed cells fully rescued eVP40 VLP production across all levels of STIM1 suppression (Fig 3B, VLPs, bottom panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to results with STIM1 shRNA, budding of eVP40 VLPs was significantly reduced (Fig 3C, VLP) following siRNA mediated STIM1 suppression ( greater than 90%, Fig 3C, middle panel); and over-expression of exogenous STIM1 restored eVP40 VLP production (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together with results from experiments performed on E106A HEK293T cells, these data definitively establish a role for STIM1/Orai dependent Ca2+ signals in regulation of VLP egress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pharmacological_block_of_Orai_channels_inhibits_eVP40_and_mVP40_VLP_production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genetic approaches outlined above to modulate STIM1 expression and Orai1 permeation establish a novel and common critical role for STIM1 and Orai1 in filovirus and arenavirus budding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the broad utility of targeting ion channels to regulate a range of cell physiological functions, we asked whether pharmacological blockade of Orai might represent an effective strategy for regulating filovirus and arenavirus budding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although high affinity Orai1 blockers for in vivo applications are not available at present, we tested several commercially available inhibitors including Synta66 and 2-APB, both of which inhibit Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry in HEK293T cells at micromolar levels (1050 M) [38, 39] without impacting calcium release from the ER (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both 2-APB and Synta66 inhibited eVP40- (Fig 4A and 4B) and mVP40-induced (Fig 4C and 4D) VLP production with identical potency as inhibition of Orai-mediated calcium entry, and neither drug affected cellular expression of VP40 or actin (Fig 4A4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A concentration of 2-APB that fully blocks Orai1 channels (50 M) [38] inhibited eVP40 VLP production (Fig 4A, right panel) by ~5 fold and mVP40 VLP production (Fig 4C, right panel) by ~50 fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, Synta66 (50M) substantially inhibited eVP40 (~5 fold) and mVP40 VLP (~10 fold) production (Fig 4B and 4D) with no effect on steady state levels of cellular VP40 or actin and without altering membrane localization of viral proteins (S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, as neither 2-APB (Fig 4E) nor Synta66 (Fig 4F) exerted cytotoxic effects on cells under conditions of these measurements (cell viability, cellular production of VP40, or VP40 membrane localization, Fig 4 and S3 Fig), their anti-budding activity can be attributed to inhibition of Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, an additional Orai selective inhibitor (RO2959 [40]), which recently became commercially available, also blocks eVP40 VLP formation (~10-fold) with a potency that parallels its inhibition of calcium permeation of the channel (S4 Fig, IC50 = ~2.5M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the sensitivity of budding to three chemically distinct Orai inhibitors, at the same concentration that blocks calcium permeation of Orai, further substantiates the critical role of Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry in VLP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pharmacological_block_of_Orai_channels_inhibits_arenavirus_budding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next sought to validate VLP findings by examining the effect of the Orai1 inhibitors Synta66 and 2-APB on budding of the live attenuated Candid-1 JUNV vaccine strain [41, 42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, VeroE6 cells infected with live attenuated Candid-1 JUNV were cultured in the absence or presence of Orai inhibitors, and infectious virions produced from these cells were quantified in a focus forming assay (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enumeration of JUNV foci revealed a statistically significant, dose-dependent reduction in JUNV virus production following treatment with Synta66 (Fig 5A) or 2-APB (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, neither compound affected the viability of cells cultured under conditions mimicking those used for JUNV infection experiments (Fig 5A and 5B, right panels), nor affected the synthesis of JUNV GP in infected VeroE6 cells at any concentration tested (Fig 5A and 5B, Western blots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings corroborate results of VLP budding assays (Fig 2) and demonstrate that Orai1-mediated calcium entry is required for efficient budding of infectious JUNV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Orai1_regulates_budding_of_infectious_pathogenic_strains_of_EBOV__MARV__LASV__and_JUNV  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the general requirement we identify for Orai channels in filovirus and arenavirus VLP production and JUNV (Candid-1) budding, we next sought to determine whether Orai channels regulate spread of infectious pathogenic strains of EBOV, MARV, LASV, and JUNV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first examined viral spread, an indicator of efficient viral budding, in HEK293T cells that constitutively express the dominant negative permeation defective variant of Orai1 (E106A) used in VLP assays described above (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells were infected at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), which resulted in the infection of approximately 25% of the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then incubated for a period of time that equates to several rounds of viral replication, allowing us to assess viral spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the percent of Orai1 E106A expressing cells infected with live BSL-4 variants of EBOV, MARV, JUNV, or LASV was significantly lower than Orai WT cells infected with the same viruses (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with a role for Orai in the spread of infectious filoviruses and arenaviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next assessed the effect of the Orai blocker Synta66 on the spread of these BSL-4 pathogens, because it is a more consistent Orai blocker than 2-APB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral spread was assessed by infecting HeLa cells with LASV, JUNV, MARV, or EBOV at a low MOI and then treating with vehicle or Synta66 at the indicated concentrations beginning 1 hour post infection and for the duration of experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventy two (LASV, JUNV) or 96 (MARV, EBOV) hours post infection we quantified the percentage of cells infected with virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each virus, we observed a significant Synta66 dose-dependent decrease in the percentage of cells infected (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with inhibition of viral spread, we also observed a general decrease in the number and size of infected cell clusters with increasing Synta66 concentration (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the more potent inhibition by Synta66 of mVP40- versus eVP40-mediated VLP production (Fig 4), Synta66 also exerted more potent inhibition of live MARV than EBOV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the spread of both arenaviruses was more sensitive to Orai inhibition than either filovirus (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, cultures treated with higher concentrations of Synta66 and for a prolonged period of time (7296 hours) contained fewer cells than vehicle control treated cultures as measured by the number of nuclei (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we normalized the results as the percent of cells infected at the time of analysis for each condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in cell numbers, however, does not appear to reflect toxicity (see Figs 4F and 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, as HeLa cells autonomously divide, fewer cells more likely reflects an effect of prolonged Synta66 treatment on cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we evaluated Synta66 induced toxicity by two separate methodologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-titer Glo viability measurements revealed that prolonged Synta66 produced a dose-dependent decrease in ATP (S5 Fig) that is attributed to a decrease in the overall number of cells in cultures and not an effect of Synta66 on cell viability (see Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then utilized an Alamar Blue assay to assess the metabolic health of Synta66 treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, cellular oxidation-reduction potential of Synta66 treated and vehicle control treated cells were equivalent, confirming comparable metabolic activity (S5 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while prolonged Synta66 treatment resulted in lower overall cell numbers, those cells that are present are metabolically healthy and are fully capable of producing virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next sought to definitively establish that the effect of Synta66 on virus spread is due to inhibition of virus egress and not entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first pretreated HeLa cells with Synta66 and then infected with a high MOI of LASV, JUNV, MARV, or EBOV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then fixed after only 23 viral replication cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infecting with a high MOI and fixing soon after infection ensured that the extent of infection minimally involves spread between cells and rather reflects the extent of primary infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these high MOI conditions, we observed relatively little effect of Synta66 on infection levels with only modest inhibition of infection evident at high Synta66 concentrations (S6 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further confirmation that Synta66 blocks egress of live filoviruses and arenaviruses was obtained by assessing the amount of virus released into culture supernatants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants were collected between 48 and 96 hours post-infection with JUNV, LASV, MARV, or EBOV from Synta66 or vehicle treated HeLa cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with all of our VLP (Figs 24) and live virus data (Figs 5, 6, 7A and 7B) we found that Synta66 (30M) significantly reduced the titer of infectious Lassa, Junín, Marburg, and Ebola virion particles in culture supernatants (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, this data provide a clear and comprehensive demonstration that Synta66 treatment significantly impairs authentic filovirus and arenavirus budding and release from infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our results clearly establish that 1) Orai1-mediated Ca2+ entry is a critical virus-triggered host signal that regulates filovirus and arenavirus budding, and 2) STIM1 and Orai1 represent novel targets for broad-spectrum control of these emerging and often fatal viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the conserved role for Orai mediated calcium entry among these four hemorrhagic fever viruses raises the interesting possibility that Orai inhibitors may have general utility for broad spectrum control of these and other enveloped RNA viruses that bud by similar Ca2+ dependent mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recent catastrophic outbreak of EBOV in West Africa highlights the need to develop therapeutics for EBOV and other hemorrhagic fever viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, much progress has been made toward the development of candidate vaccines and therapies against EBOV that are currently in clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it is critically important that we improve our understanding of the mechanisms of hemorrhagic fever virus pathogenesis not only to identify novel viral targets, but also to identify host targets and common mechanisms that these viruses require for completion of their life cycles as these could lead to the development of broad spectrum host oriented therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A key advantage of therapeutics that target conserved host pathways required broadly by families of viruses for transmission is the potential for broad spectrum efficacy compared with drugs that target strain specific viral targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, host targets should be essentially immutable and thereby insensitive to selective pressures that normally allow pathogens to develop drug resistance [3, 1223].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we focused on the second messenger Ca2+ and the host proteins responsible for its mobilization and asked whether calcium signals within host cells orchestrate virus assembly and budding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While calcium has been implicated generally in EBOV and HIV-1 budding [32, 43, 44], previous efforts have not addressed if and how matrix proteins encoded by filoviruses or arenaviruses might trigger changes in Ca2+ concentration in host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that the filovirus matrix protein VP40 and JUNV Z protein trigger STIM1/Orai activation and that the resulting influx of extracellular Ca2+ controls both VLP formation and production of infectious filovirus and arenavirus progeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, using Orai channel inhibitors, Orai permeation defective lines, and by suppressing STIM1 expression, we establish STIM1 and Orai as effective host targets for pharmacological regulation of virus egress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted; however, that we cannot rule out a role for other Orai isoforms (Orai2 and Orai3) in to the residual budding observed for live virus from E106A or Synta66 treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While we have established a critical role for Orai-mediated calcium entry in budding of hemorrhagic fever viruses, the mechanism by which Ca2+ does so remains an important question and the focus of ongoing efforts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a number of critical steps implicated in efficient budding of enveloped RNA viruses have been linked to cellular Ca2+ signals, including the activation and localization of specific ESCRT components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not absolutely required, the ESCRT pathway has been shown to play a key role in efficient budding of a plethora of RNA viruses including filoviruses, arenaviruses, rhabdoviruses, and retroviruses [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that the observed calcium regulation of budding described here may be linked mechanistically to the role of ESCRT during virus egress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the structure, activation, and interactions of ESCRT-related proteins such as Tsg101, Nedd4, and Alix have been shown to be regulated in part by calcium [4447].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, given that Ca2+ control of membrane repair reflects ESCRT induced shedding of damaged membrane [48], one might also speculate that Ca2+ dependent mechanisms are similarly triggered by insertion of viral proteins in the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies underway are thus focused on determining whether Ca2+ controls budding through regulation of ESCRT pathway function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
STIM1 and Orai1 mediated Ca2+ signals have been implicated in distinct steps of the life cycle of other viruses including the replication of Rotaviruses, which are non-enveloped RNA viruses that do not bud from the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constitutive STIM1 (and Orai1) activation observed in rotavirus-infected cells reflects an effect of its nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) on endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ permeability [49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, ongoing efforts within our group to understand the mechanisms by which hemorrhagic fever virus matrix proteins trigger STIM1/Orai activation include testing whether VP40 might likewise trigger Ca2+ leak from the ER by inhibiting SERCA pump activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Ca2+ influx also seems to regulate entry of West Nile virus [50, 51], Coxsackievirus [52, 53], Hepatitis B virus [54], and Epstein Barr virus [55, 56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently it was shown that subunits of a functionally distinct family of voltage-gated calcium channels (VDCCs) also play a role in JUNV and Mouse Mammary Tumor pseudovirus entry and infection [57] and that the VDCC blockers nifedipine and verapamil suppressed host cell entry by these viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly; however, in this instance the involvement of VDCC subunits seemed to be distinct from any role in regulating Ca2+ levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How VDCC inhibitors might operate independently of any action on VDCC Ca2+ permeation is unclear, but could reflect the promiscuous affinity of VDCC inhibitors for channels including voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, verapamil and nifedipine also block voltage-gated potassium channels that set the membrane potential of non-excitable cells [58, 59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depolarization of the plasma membrane as a result of Kv channel blockade could indirectly block calcium entry by dissipating the electrical driving force (membrane potential) required for calcium permeation of Orai [6062].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While these studies cumulatively point to additional roles for Orai1-mediated and independent Ca2+ influx in steps of infection and replication used by a range of disparate viruses, these roles are distinct from the selective requirement we identify for Orai-dependent calcium entry in budding of filoviruses and arenaviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Orai might represent a conserved target for regulating budding of additional enveloped RNA viruses, including retroviruses such as HIV-1, which buds by similar mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, similar to hemorrhagic fever viruses, the HIV-1 matrix protein Gag directs HIV-1 budding in part, via well-characterized L-domain interactions with ESCRT proteins, and Gag mediated VLP formation also exhibits dependence on Ca2+ regulation [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further study is needed to fully assess the role for calcium in the HIV-1 lifecycle because, unlike filoviruses and arenaviruses, Gag-mediated VLP production was found to be insensitive to high concentrations of 2-APB (up to 200uM) that fully block Ca2+ permeation of Orai channels [44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we provide the first direct evidence that host Ca2+ signals, triggered by virus activation of STIM1 and Orai, are among key host mechanisms that orchestrate late steps of filovirus and arenavirus assembly and budding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, from a therapeutic perspective, Orai channels are ubiquitously expressed and like ion channels in general, they represent pharmacologically accessible (cell surface) therapeutic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Orai1 inhibitors by themselves appear to have broad spectrum efficacy, an exciting possibility raised by our results is that drug cocktails formulated to target sequential steps in the virus life cycle, including entry, L-domain/host interactions, and other steps involved in budding, could produce enhanced potency, coverage and efficacy over approaches targeting any one host dependent step in the virus life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while other calcium channel modulators identified may have distinct targets and even calcium independent effects, they may synergize with Orai1, and also L-domain inhibitors weve described previously that block VP40 and Z protein L-domain interactions with host Nedd4 and Tsg101 [42, 63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the ability of certain individuals to survive hemorrhagic fever virus infection seems to reflect their capacity to mount a robust anti-viral immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of the severity and the acute nature of these viral diseases, the impact of side effects and even minor effects on cell proliferation that might be associated with long term administration of Orai inhibitors that would be required for immune suppression and immune modulation, may be tolerable in the context of infection with these highly pathogenic and often fatal viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, there is no evidence from murine models that the loss of STIM or Orai activity or function would affect antigen induced lymphocyte activation required for an antiviral immune response [64, 65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus our prediction is that administration of Orai1 or STIM1 inhibitors, or cocktails that could also include L-domain inhibitors, would slow or dampen virus transmission within and between individuals, and thereby could provide infected individuals additional time needed to mount a protective adaptive immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Synta66 and the more potent compound RO2959 are no longer being developed as therapeutics, several smaller pharmaceutical companies and academic groups persist in efforts to develop potent Orai1 inhibitors to suppress the pathogenesis of chronic immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If and when these become available, direct inhibition of enveloped RNA virus budding from host cells and transmission between individuals may represent an entirely novel use for these channel blockers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
