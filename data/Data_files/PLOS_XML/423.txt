Flapping before Flight: High Resolution, Three-Dimensional Skeletal Kinematics of Wings and Legs during Avian Development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some of the greatest transformations in vertebrate history involve developmental and evolutionary origins of avian flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flight is the most power-demanding mode of locomotion, and volant adult birds have many anatomical features that presumably help meet these demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, juvenile birds, like the first winged dinosaurs, lack many hallmarks of advanced flight capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of large wings they have small protowings, and instead of robust, interlocking forelimb skeletons their limbs are more gracile and their joints less constrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such traits are often thought to preclude extinct theropods from powered flight, yet young birds with similarly rudimentary anatomies flap-run up slopes and even briefly fly, thereby challenging longstanding ideas on skeletal and feather function in the theropod-avian lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though skeletons and feathers are the common link between extinct and extant theropods and figure prominently in discussions on flight performance (extant birds) and flight origins (extinct theropods), skeletal inter-workings are hidden from view and their functional relationship with aerodynamically active wings is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the first time, we use X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology to visualize skeletal movement in developing birds, and explore how development of the avian flight apparatus corresponds with ontogenetic trajectories in skeletal kinematics, aerodynamic performance, and the locomotor transition from pre-flight flapping behaviors to full flight capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reveal that developing chukars (Alectoris chukar) with rudimentary flight apparatuses acquire an avian flight stroke early in ontogeny, initially by using their wings and legs cooperatively and, as they acquire flight capacity, counteracting ontogenetic increases in aerodynamic output with greater skeletal channelization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conjunction with previous work, juvenile birds thereby demonstrate that the initial function of developing wings is to enhance leg performance, and that aerodynamically active, flapping wings might better be viewed as adaptations or exaptations for enhancing leg performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When we think about form and function in the vertebrate tree of life, we usually envision the adult phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether an invasion of land during the origin of tetrapods or the acquisition of flight in a developing bird, vertebrate body plans are typically discussed with respect to the adult conditionparticularly for transitions in locomotor mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This adultocentric mindset [1] implicitly assumes that the adult body plan is most affected by selective forces, and that juvenile stages are simply a means to achieving adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Juvenile animals, however, add a unique and crucial perspective to form and function in the tree of life, by demonstrating how transitional, morphing anatomies function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals in many species must forage and find refuge at immature stages when they are underdeveloped and highly vulnerable, such that selection on juveniles for locomotor performance (precocial animals), or on parents for care that buffers young from the environment (altricial animals), is presumably intense [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though sparsely studied, locomotor ontogeny is an integral element of understanding how species body plans are assembled along extant tips in the tree of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, many juveniles locomote using rudimentary morphological features that are not only missing the specializations of adult counterparts, but that also share similarities with transitional structures of extinct relatives [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing animals thereby illuminate deeper branching of the tree as well, by showing how transitions in form effect transitions in function and helping to elucidate the functional attributes of fossils with similar morphologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, though we know relatively little about juvenile locomotion and ecology, quantifying developmental transitions in form and function can provide important insight into biological patterns of both the present and past (for a discussion on Haeckel and the relationship between ontogeny and evolution, see Box 1 in [10]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is true for many vertebrates [1114], but particularly evident in developing birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Flight-capable birds are one of the most striking, textbook cases for form-function congruence [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to other tetrapods and their theropod ancestors, extant adult birds have highly modified integuments and musculoskeletal systems, and it has long been assumed that many of these modifications are adaptations or exaptations (aptations) [16] for meeting the demands of flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ideas are so well accepted and ingrained in literature that avian flight is often discussed colloquially as a binary character: animals (or fossils) with flight aptations are flight-capable, animals without them are not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing birds, however, challenge this view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Like early winged theropods (non-avian pennaraptorans and basal avialans), immature birds lack many hallmarks of advanced flight capability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of large wings they have small protowings, and instead of hypertrophied pectoral muscles and a robust, interlocking skeleton, their musculoskeletal apparatus is more gracile and their joints less constrained [10,1720] (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such features are often assumed to preclude avian ancestors from powerful flight and bird-like wingstrokes [2123], because it is generally thought that:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Left.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flight-capable adult birds have many morphological features that are presumably adaptations or exaptations for meeting aerial challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large wings with stiff, asymmetrical primary feathers (A) are thought to stabilize feathers against oncoming airflow [48], prevent excessive deformation [23], and reduce feather permeability [49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fused thoracic and sacral vertebrae may increase trunk rigidity and help transmit limb-generated forces to the rest of the body (notarium, B), and/or possibly act as a shock absorber during landing (synsacrum, C) [21,26,28,50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Appendicularly, the robust forelimb apparatus (e.g., sternum with large keel (D), strut-like and well-articulated coracoids (E), bowed ulna (F)) allows for the attachment and contraction of powerful flight muscles (e.g., pectoralis, supracoracoideus) [27,28,26,25,21,51], while the acrocoracoid and triosseal canal (not shown; present in juveniles but less elevated above glenoid) allow the supracoracoideus muscle to act as a pulley, contributing to humeral elevation and rotation [28,26,2933].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distally, reduced and fused skeletal elements and channelized limb joints (G, H) are thought to reduce mass and permit rapid, efficient limb oscillation, coordinate elbow and wrist movement, keep a planar wing orientation during the downstroke, and increase stride effectiveness by restricting ankle movements to a single plane of motion [27,28,26,22,52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these features are a key component of the avian bauplan, and a classic example of anatomical specialization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing birdslike early winged dinosaurslack many hallmarks of advanced flight capacity [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of large wings they have small protowings, with a more gracile skeleton and less constrained joints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immature birds nevertheless flap their rudimentary wings to accomplish a variety of locomotor tasks [20,5355]; in fact, many anatomical specializations of adults are acquired long after flight capacity is achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing birds thereby challenge the traditional, longstanding view of form-function relationships in the theropod-avian lineage (A-H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cervical vertebrae and pedal phalanges not shown; juvenile keel on top of adult keel, for scale (D); in (G), left image is pronation of carpometacarpus, right is abduction (juvenile joints always more flexible).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although cartilaginous skeletal components are not shown, this does not alter functional interpretations of the juvenile skeleton (e.g., juveniles possess a small cartilaginous extension of the keel, but both the keel and the muscles that attach to it are still proportionally much smaller in juveniles than adults; carpal bones of developing birds have the specialized shapes of adults, but are poorly ossified and not capable of resisting enough joint torque to channelize the wrist joint (G)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images of feather microstructure (A) reprinted from [18] under a CC BY license, with permission from The Company of Biologists Limited, original copyright 2011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153446.g001  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These ideas are intuitive, consistent with the morphologies of adult birds, and often extrapolated to infer that animals with small wings and relatively gracile, unchannelized forelimb skeletons either do not use their feathered forelimbs at all (developing birds), or used them passively (e.g., gliding) and/or for non-locomotor purposes, such as display (many extinct theropods) (Table 1 in [10]; [3747]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Developing birds challenge this adultocentric view because fledglings with very rudimentary anatomies begin flapping and producing aerodynamic forces long before acquiring flight aptations and the avian body plan characteristic of adults [10,18,56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Juveniles in species with a diverse array of wing-leg morphologies and life history strategies frequently recruit their legs and incipient wings cooperatively to avoid predators or reach refuges ([5759]; AMH, KPD, and Tom Martin, personal observations; see juvenile birds in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k94EDd8aKng and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3USAC-Ky25s), by flap-running up slopes (wing-assisted incline running / walking; WAIR) and controlling aerial descents [53,54], swimming and steaming across water [55], and/or jumping into brief flapping flights [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, in at least some precocial species, the development of flight capacity (~1820 days in Alectoris chukar) precedes the development of an adult-like musculoskeletal apparatus (close to ~100 days) by a substantial and biologically relevant margin [10,20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immature birds thereby call into question many longstanding views on form-function relationships in the avian body plan: why are these animals capable of aerodynamically active flapping behaviors in the apparent absence of many flight aptations?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we integrate a series of previous studies on Chukar Partridges (Alectoris chukar; precocial ground bird) with X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM; www.xromm.org), to explore how the development of flight aptations (Fig 1) corresponds with ontogenetic trajectories in skeletal kinematics, aerodynamic performance [18,56], and the locomotor transition from pre-flight flapping behaviors (e.g., WAIR, steaming) to full flight capacity [57,5355,20,60,61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flapping kinematics are integral to the ability to fly and figure prominently in discussions on flight performance (neontology) and the origin of flight (paleontology), yet skeletal inter-workings are hidden from view and their functional relationship with aerodynamically active wings is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this relationship and better understand how fledglings with rudimentary forelimb apparatuses generate useful aerodynamic forces as they acquire flight capacity, we used XROMM to quantify ontogenetic trajectories in three-dimensional wing and leg kinematics during a pre-flight flapping behaviorWAIRand test three hypotheses:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A lack of kinematic differences would suggest some sort of compensatory mechanism in younger birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discriminated between these possibilities by comparing skeletal kinematics for four ontogenetic stages (78 days post-hatching (dph), 1112 dph, 18 dph, adult) flap-running on shallow substrate angles (6065°), and for two ontogenetic stages (23 dph, adults) flap-running on different substrate widths (narrow versus wide) or on steeper substrate angles (7080°) (Table A in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, these treatments build upon previous work to investigate musculoskeletal-kinematic-aerodynamic relationships, and offer a more holistic perspective on form-function relationships in the avian bauplan (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conjunction with previous studies, our results help clarify the functional interplay between rudimentary musculoskeletal apparatuses and aerodynamically active, flapping protowings / wings, and thereby offer important insight into both the ontogenetic and evolutionary acquisition of flight capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Locomotor ontogeny provides key functional, ecological, and evolutionary insight into the avian body plan, by revealing how transitional, morphing anatomies function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) From a functional perspective, adult birds are the endpoints of an ontogenetic and evolutionary continuum and cannot clearly elucidate how specific morphological attributes affect to the ability to become airborne.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly all adult birds share a suite of specialized morphologies, are flight-capable or secondarily flightless, and may not provide enough variation in morphology and flight capacity to expose relationships between these two variables (though adult birds of some species fly poorly [62], they have not been studied).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a traditional, adultocentric framework that perceives many morphological features as aptations for aerial locomotion, most relationships between form and locomotor function are therefore assumed rather than empirically tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Juvenile birds have rudimentary locomotor structures, and engage in pre-flight flapping behaviors as they morph into adulthood and acquire flight capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though poorly studied [7,57], morphing juveniles fill a longstanding gap in knowledge and help clarify functional attributes of the avian body plan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By revealing form-function relationships that underlie obligately-bipedal to flight-capable transitions (i-iv), and thereby establishing how features are related to flight, developing birds can provide key insight into locomotor aptations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) For example, previous work has shown that juvenile chukars with rudimentary flight apparatuses (image i) transition from leg- to wing-based modes of locomotion by using their legs and wings cooperatively, and generating small but important amounts of aerodynamic force (iii, data from [18]) that increase throughout ontogeny and allow birds to flap-run up steeper obstacles and eventually fly (iv, data from [20,53,55,61]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we quantify the ontogeny of skeletal kinematics (ii), to better understand relationships between form, function, performance, and behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image i in (C) reprinted from [10] under a CC BY license, with permission from Cell Press, original copyright 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals__age_classes__and_treatments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chukars were purchased from commercial breeders as day old chicks or as adults over the course of two breeding seasons (2009, 2011).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All birds were fed ad libitum in temperature-controlled rooms (chicks) or in outdoor aviaries (adults), either at the Field Research Station at Fort Missoula, University of Montana, MT, USA, or at the Brown Animal Care Facility, Brown University, RI, USA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The University of Montana and/or Brown University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees approved all protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few days prior to collecting x-ray videos, we implanted 0.51 mm tantalum bead markers in the left humerus, ulna, radius, and carpometacarpus of one anesthetized adult and two anesthetized immature birds (marker-based XROMM [63], 2011), at the Field Research Station; we did not implant markers in 2009 (markerless XROMM / scientific rotoscoping [64]) due to the small size and extensive cartilaginous components of juvenile bird bones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We chose four age classes for analysis, based on ontogenetic transitions in morphology and locomotor capacity (Table A in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each bird in each age class, we used markerless and/or marker-based XROMM to animate at least one full wingstroke (left and right limbs for juveniles, left limb for adults due to size constraints) and one full stride cycle (one limb in stance and the other in swing) during WAIR, focusing on the three major joints in the forelimb and hind limb (shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each wingstroke and stride cycle analyzed was from one continuous trial (no partial strokes or cycles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All birds were filmed flap-running on ramps angled at 6065° (Treatment 1) (n = 2 individuals for adults, data from [60]; n = 3 individuals for juveniles due to higher expected variability and/or difficulty in rotoscoping) (Table A in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish between our three alternative hypotheses (H1-H3), we additionally filmed older juveniles and adults at different ramp widths (Treatment 2) (n = 2 individuals) or at steeper angles (Treatment 3) (n = 1 individual, due to experimental constraints).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For treatments with smaller sample sizes (n = 12 individuals), we animated multiple wingbeats and stride cycles per bird (all from separate trials).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any trials in which the bird tripped, jumped, or paused were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

X-ray_video_collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We filmed all trials in the W. M. Keck Foundation XROMM Facility at Brown University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds performed WAIR on medium grit, sandpaper-covered ramps centered in the beam field of two Varian model G-1086 x-ray tubes (40 kV, 200250 mA, magnification 02; continuous radiation) and two Dunlee model TH9447QXH590 image intensifiers (SID ~90 cm) (S1 Video; www.xromm.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For trials at 6065° (Treatments 1, 2), we positioned the x-ray tubes dorsally and laterally to the birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For trials at steeper angles (Treatment 3), we positioned the x-ray tubes ventrolaterally and dorsolaterally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray video outputs of the image intensifiers were captured either by two synchronized high-speed 1200x1200 Phantom v10 digital video cameras recording at 500 fps and shutter speeds of 1/400-1/1000 s (all data except Treatment 1 adults), or by two 1024x1024 Photron cameras (500 fps, shutter speeds of 1/6000 s; Treatment 1 adults [60]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Video_calibration_and_undistortion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We collected images of a perforated metal grid and calibration cube images prior to and after each day of video collection to remove distortion and calibrate the cameras [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CT_scans_and_skeletal_models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After filming each age class, we euthanized and froze all birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then scanned individuals at the Rhode Island Hospital (CT; 80 kV, 400 mA, 0.625 mm slice thickness) (Treatment 1 adults), at the University of Texas at Austin (www.digimorph.org) (CT; 190200 kV, 0.17 mA, 0.073130.09751 mm slice thickness) (Treatment 1 juveniles), or at the Digital Imaging Facility at Harvard University (CT or microCT; 116152 kV, 0.0430.068 mA, 0.07490.1075 mm slice thickness) (Treatments 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skeletal elements and markers, if present, were segmented out in Amira 4.0 (Mercury) or in OsiriX v.4.0 32-bit, and saved as polygonal mesh models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inertial axes were calculated for each mesh model, using MATLAB [65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Animation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Wingstroke_and_stride_cycle_transitions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following [60], we defined the upstroke-downstroke transition as the point in the wingstroke cycle when the tip of the manus reaches its maximum distance above the sternum (dorsoventral distance in a transverse section centered at, and angled perpendicular to, the sternum; distance independent of body orientation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, we defined the downstroke-upstroke transition as the point in the wingstroke cycle when the tip of the manus reaches its minimum dorsoventral distance above the sternum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the legs, we identified transitions between stance and swing phase visually: the beginning and end of stance were defined as toe-down and toe-off, respectively, and swing was defined as the aerial phase between toe-off and toe-down.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Once we had animated each trial and identified phase transitions, we imported raw translations and rotations of each joint into IGOR PRO v6.12 (Wavemetrics Inc) for data preparation and visualization, and into R [69] for statistical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to statistically compare different birds and different trials, we first scaled the raw data (all limbs, all trials; IGOR PRO) such that each wingstroke or stride cycle was 101 frames in length, with the duration of the downstroke or stance phase representing 50% of the duration of the stroke cycle or stride cycle, respectively (1 frame for downstroke-upstroke and stance-swing transitions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visually compare mean kinematics across age classes, for each kinematic rotation (x, y, z) at a given joint (shoulder, hip, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  we calculated the mean rotation of a given age class and treatment, at each point of the stroke or stride cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Averages were then smoothed using a Loess function (IGRO PRO), to adjust for kinematic discontinuities (some birds started in downstroke / stance, others started in upstroke / swing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Validation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess how accurately we were able to rotoscope flap-running birds, we compared marker-based and rotoscoped joint rotations at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, for one adult and one juvenile (9 dph) bird.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that forelimbs are more challenging to animate than hind limbs during WAIR (higher rates of oscillation, less ossified in juveniles), they provide a conservative estimate of rotoscoping accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the adult bird, we implanted markers into the humerus, ulna, and carpometacarpus prior to euthanasia, filmed the bird flap-running, then euthanized the bird and calculated marker-based joint rotations as described above (see CT scans and skeletal models, Animation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check rotoscoping accuracy and precision, we measured the same sequence of video once using markers, and once via rotoscoping after digitally removing marker shadows from the x-ray images using the clone stamp tool in Adobe Photoshop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D. Baier removed the markers from the video, and A. Heers (who rotoscoped all juveniles, and adults on steep angles) manually rotoscoped the bones over the same set of frames (see scientific rotoscoping under Animation, above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the juvenile bird, since we were not able to implant markers on the live bird and compare techniques over a wingbeat during WAIR, we compared markerless and marker-based XROMM by elevating and depressing the wing postmortem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we implanted 34 markers on the sternum, humerus, ulna, and carpometacarpus, then filmed the bird raising and lowering its wing by securing the bird with a wooden dowel and pulling up on its primary feathers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined markerless and marker-based joint rotations of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist the same way as for the adult, with two exceptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E1) For rotoscoping the humerus, we had to give the shoulder joint the same positions as the shoulder axes in the marker-based file, because in contrast to our original data the proximal end of the humerus was nearly completely obscured by the dowel used to secure the bird; humerus orientations were still rotoscoped manually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E2) For the marker-based positions and orientations of the sternum (and downstream coracoids), we used the position defined by the markers but determined the orientation by rotoscoping, because collinear markers along the sternal keel prevented accurate measure of sternal long-axis rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As expected, rotoscoping accuracy varies slightly depending on bone identity and bird age, but margins of error are small and would not override our results (see Figure B in S1 File for full discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Developing and adult birds flap-running on 6065° inclines display a number of kinematic differences, expressed either as ontogenetic trends (78 dph  1112 dph  18 dph  adults) or as collective disparities between juveniles and adults (all juveniles versus adults) (H1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences are not due to the length of the wings with respect to substrate width (H2), and largely disappear when birds are compared at similar levels of effort (H3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, immature and adult birds with very different skeletal morphologies (Fig 1) are nevertheless capable of performing very similar skeletal movements, and in spite of lacking many flight aptations, developing birds implement adult-like flapping kinematics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
H1__all_birds_on_shallow_(6065°)_inclines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In general, juvenile and adult chukars produce similar types of movement (e.g., flexion, extension) at similar points in the stroke or stride cycle, with juveniles tending to have slightly higher wingbeat and stride frequencies, and slightly lower duty cycles during the wingstroke (Tables B and C in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the magnitudes of these movements differ across ages, with juveniles showing slightly higher levels of inter-individual variation (Table D in S1 File) but collectively more extreme and exaggerated movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the forelimbs, compared to adults, developing birds employ a greater stroke amplitude (#1 in Fig 3 and Figure C in S1 File; S3 Video), hold their wings more extended (#2) and at a higher angle of attack (#3a) during the downstroke, and recover from the downstroke with an exaggerated scooping (#4) and tucking (#5) motion during the upstroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all birds, long axis rotation of the manus occurs roughly in opposition to long axis rotation of the antebrachium (#3b), with juveniles having a greater range of long axis rotation at the wrist than adults (Box A in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hind limbs, juveniles take longer, more lunge-like strides (#1 in Fig 4 and Figure D in S1 File; S4 Video), have a less splayed posture at mid-stance (#2), position their feet more lateral to the body midline (#3), and seem to transition through a series of gaits before becoming adult-like (lunging  speed-skater  tight-rope walker; #4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing and adult birds flap-running on similar inclines thus display a number of differences in both fore- and hind limb kinematics (see Table E in S1 File for significant differences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

H2__older_juveniles_and_adults_on_narrow_versus_wide_substrates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Substrate width does not appear to affect forelimb kinematics during WAIR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Older birds may keep their wings more elevated on wider substrates (p0.31), but this does not affect forelimb kinematics in any predictable way (Figure E in S1 File, Table F in S1 File), and does not prevent birds from depressing their wings more when necessary (see H3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

H3__adults_on_shallow_(6065°)_versus_steep_(7080°)_inclines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nearly all observed differences between juveniles and adults (H1) are diminished or eliminated when adults flap-run up steeper slopes (7080°).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the forelimbs (Figure F in S1 File), adults flap-running up 7080° inclines increase their stroke amplitude to juvenile-like levels, by depressing and retracting their humeri more than when flap-running up shallower inclines (#1 in Fig 3 and Figure C in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the downstroke, adults keep their wrists more extended (#2), and supinate their antebrachia morepresumably to adopt a higher angle of attack (#3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the upstroke, adults scoop (#4) and tuck (#5) their wings more, by supinating their humeri and antebrachia more, abducting their antebrachia more, flexing their elbows more, and adducting their manus more.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in the hind limbs (Figure F in S1 File), adults on steep inclines take long, more lunging and more juvenile-like steps compared to adults on shallow inclines (#1 in Fig 4 and Figure D in S1 File), by protracting and retracting their femora more, flexing their knees more, and flexing and extending their ankles more.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults also abduct their femora less (#2), and position their feet more laterally (#3) by adjusting long axis rotation of the femur (more medial rotation) and tibiotarsus (more lateral rotation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, nearly all differences observed between juveniles and adults flap-running on relatively shallow inclines (#s 15 and 13 in Figs 3 and 4) are reduced, or disappear, when juveniles flap-running on shallow inclines (6065°) are compared to adults flap-running on steeper (7080°), more challenging inclines (see Table E in S1 File for p-values).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Despite having extremely underdeveloped musculoskeletal apparatuses and incipient wings [10], our results indicate that developing birds acquire an avian flight stroke early in ontogeny (part (i) below), initially using their wings and legs cooperatively and, as they acquire flight capacity, meeting ontogenetic increases in aerodynamic output with greater skeletal channelization (part (ii)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have important implications for understanding the development of flight in extant birds, and reconstructing the origin of flight in extinct theropods (part (iii)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrating skeletal kinematics with previous work on locomotor ontogeny, we posit that aerodynamically active, flapping forelimbs may be adaptations or exaptations for enhancing leg performance, and that wing-enhanced leg performance could have been an important impetus for increases in pectoral muscle mass and improvements in aerodynamic output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(i)_Developing_birds_with_rudimentary_anatomies_acquire_an_avian_flight_stroke_early_in_ontogeny  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When flap-running up the same incline, juveniles and adults have similar patterns but different magnitudes of joint movement: juveniles have more exaggerated or more extreme movements than adults (Figs 3 and 4, Figures C and D in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the forelimbs, juveniles have greater stroke amplitudes (#1 in Fig 3), and extend their wings more during the downstroke (#2) but scoop (#4) and tuck (#5) their wings more during the upstroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas adults pronate their antebrachia ~10° in downstroke and supinate their manus, juveniles supinate their antebrachia up to 30° achieving higher mid-wing angles of attack [61]and pronate their manus (#3) (Box A in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hind limbs, juveniles take long, more lunging strides (# 1 in Fig 4), adduct their femora more (#2) in the middle of the stride cycle, and position their feet more laterally (#3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these differences suggest that flap-running up 6065° inclines presents a greater challenge to juveniles than to adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Birds meet aerial challenges in a variety of ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When forced to take off vertically or presented with greater physical demands during flight, birds respond by (i) increasing their stroke amplitude and increasing the disc area swept by the wings during downstroke [70], (ii) flapping at a higher wingbeat frequency [71], (iii) orienting their wings at a high angle of attack [72], presumably to increase resultant aerodynamic forces [18], and/or (iv) tucking in their wings during the upstroke, potentially to reduce drag and inertia [73] when stroke amplitudes and wingbeat frequencies are high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to adults, juveniles (i) sweep out a proportionally larger area during the downstroke by having a greater stroke amplitude (#1 in Fig 3) and extending their wrists to the fullest extent (#2), (iii) use a higher angle of attack (#3) [61], and (iv) tuck their wings in more during the upstroke (#s 4,5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forelimb kinematics therefore suggest that at 6065°, juveniles are performing closer to maximal levels than adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Juveniles also appear to be recruiting their hind limbs more closely to maximal levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals challenged to ascend an incline often position themselves closer to the substrate, adopting a more crouched posture (cats (Felis domesticus) [74], squirrel monkeys (Saimiri) [75]) or pitching the trunk towards the substrate (woodpeckers (Piciformes) [76]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This helps prevent falling backward when traversing steep obstacles, by keeping the center of gravity anterior to the hind limbs and reducing pitching moments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During ascents, cats and squirrel monkeys also increase limb extension at the end of stance, presumably to provide additional propulsion, just as galliforms and ratites extend their limbs more at the end of stance at higher running speeds [77].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, irrespective of incline, animals can improve balance in challenging situations by positioning their feet more laterally to increase the size of the support polygon (area between feet in which center of mass must lie to achieve static stability) [78,79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to adults, juvenile chukars not only flap-run with their bellies closer to the substrate (lower hip height, more steeply pitched trunk (Table C in S1 File)), but also extend their limbs more at the end of stance (#1 in Fig 4), and position their feet more laterally (#3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, these patterns in fore- and hind limb kinematics thus suggest that juveniles and adults perform similar behaviors at different levels of effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with previous work showing that 65° inclines should elicit greater effort in younger birds: 65° is the maximum angle of ascent via WAIR for 7 day old chukars, whereas adult chukars can flap-run up inverted surfaces [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, when adult chukars flap-run up steeper and more challenging angles (or fly upward at the same angle [60]), they revert to more juvenile-like fore- and hind limb kinematics (H3) (Figures C, D, and F in S1 File; Table E in S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ontogenetic trends or differences in wing and leg kinematics are thus largely reduced or eliminated when juveniles and adults are compared at similar levels of effort, indicating that juvenile birds with rudimentary, dinosaur-like anatomies are capable of surprisingly bird-like kinematics (i.e., juveniles and adults have similar kinematics for similar levels of effort).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of having small muscles, incipient wings, and relatively gracile and unchannelized skeletons, developing chukars can produce all elements of the avian flight stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How is this possible?  #@NEW_LINE#@#

When wings and legs are viewed in isolation (wings for aerial locomotion, legs for terrestrial), it is difficult to imagine how animals lacking flight aptations could produce useful aerodynamic forces, other than to slow aerial descents [54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, transitional flapping behaviors that involve cooperative use of wings and legs (e.g., WAIR, steaming, jumping into brief flapping flights; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3USAC-Ky25s) require less muscle power [80] and less aerodynamic force [18,56] than level flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transitional behaviors therefore allow flight-incapable juveniles to seamlessly transition to flight-capable adults, supplementing their underdeveloped wings and flight muscles with their legs until the flight apparatus can fully support body weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By reducing force and power requirements on the forelimbs, hind limb contributions to weight support and propulsion may also allow developing birds to perform complex, bird-like flapping kinematics early in ontogeny, in the absence of flight aptations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For example, in the axial skeleton, developing chukars lack the fully fused vertebrae and rigid trunk of adults (Fig 1B and 1C) but engage their wings and legs simultaneously, analogous to a quadruped, and do not need to transmit as much wing-generated force to the rest of the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smaller aerodynamic forces (less_than10% body weight in 68 day old chicks versus ~60% in adults [18,56]; Fig 2)and presumably smaller muscle forces (wing muscles ~8% body mass in 78 day old chicks versus ~27% in adults [20])translate to less torque about wing joints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may prevent the relatively unchannelized forelimb joints of juvenile birds (Fig 1G) from abducting or pronating out of planar alignment during the downstroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As juveniles increase aerodynamic output and acquire full flight capacity, their skeletal joints become more channelized (less flexible, due to increased ossification of interlocking skeletal components (e.g., v-shaped ulnare) [81] and/or greater concentration of tendons/ligaments crossing joints [AMH, personal observation]) and presumably help resist increases in torque about joints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while adults probably prevent excessive abduction and long axis rotation mainly by having channelized wing joints, juveniles may achieve the same effect by recruiting their legs and reducing torque about wing joints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, although the underdeveloped flight apparatus of juvenile birds probably results in a more caudally positioned center of mass (caudal to wings center of lift), this would not create a pitching moment during WAIR due to a counteracting moment from the hind limbs (contrast level flight, with no hind limb input).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the avian body plan in its entirety (wings + legs, skeleton + muscles + feathers) therefore explains why immature chukars lacking many hallmarks of flight capacity can nevertheless produce all elements of the avian flight stroke: their forelimbs produce and resist small amounts of force, and their hind limbs do the rest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

(iii)_Aerodynamically_active__flapping_wings_may_be_adaptations_or_exaptations_for_enhancing_leg_performance__implications_for_the_development_and_evolution_of_avian_flight  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain how flight evolved in the theropod-avian lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the initial evolutionary route(s) to flight capacity, our data can provide insight into two important topics relevant to all evolutionary scenarios: the role of the hind limbs, and the functional interplay between wing feathers and the musculoskeletal apparatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Developing birds demonstrate that many morphological features long viewed as adaptations or exaptations for flight are not necessary for flapping behaviors such as wing-assisted incline running or jumping into brief flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immature chukars with rudimentary musculoskeletal apparatuses and developing wings achieve an avian flight stroke early in ontogeny, initially by using their wings and legs cooperatively and reducing force and power requirements on the forelimbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leg contributions become less crucial as juveniles acquire the specialized anatomies of adults and become more capable of producing aerodynamic force and resisting associated torques about wing joints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while the unique morphological features of adult birds may be adaptive endpoints for powerful and/or sustained flight, rudimentary versions of these features do not preclude immature birds from flap-running and using less power-demanding forms of flight, or from flapping with adult-like kinematics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conjunction with previous studies, our findings therefore show that wing-leg cooperation is a behavioral and functional bridge between leg- and wing-based modes of locomotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feathered forelimbs serve many functions, but from a locomotor perspective, work with developing birds suggests that the initial function of developing wings is to enhance leg performance, and that aerodynamically active, flapping wings may be adaptations or exaptations for enhancing leg performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
