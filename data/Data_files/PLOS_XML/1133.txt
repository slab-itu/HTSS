Precision engineering for PRRSV resistance in pigs: Macrophages from genome edited pigs lacking CD163 SRCR5 domain are fully resistant to both PRRSV genotypes while maintaining biological function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is a panzootic infectious disease of pigs, causing major economic losses to the world-wide pig industry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PRRS manifests differently in pigs of all ages but primarily causes late-term abortions and stillbirths in sows and respiratory disease in piglets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The causative agent of the disease is the positive-strand RNA PRRS virus (PRRSV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PRRSV has a narrow host cell tropism, limited to cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD163 has been described as a fusion receptor for PRRSV, whereby the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 5 (SRCR5) region was shown to be an interaction site for the virus in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD163 is expressed at high levels on the surface of macrophages, particularly in the respiratory system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the application of CRISPR/Cas9 to pig zygotes, resulting in the generation of pigs with a deletion of Exon 7 of the CD163 gene, encoding SRCR5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of SRCR5 showed no adverse effects in pigs maintained under standard husbandry conditions with normal growth rates and complete blood counts observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) were isolated from the animals and assessed in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both PAMs and macrophages obtained from PBMCs by CSF1 stimulation (PMMs) show the characteristic differentiation and cell surface marker expression of macrophages of the respective origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression and correct folding of the SRCR5 deletion CD163 on the surface of macrophages and biological activity of the protein as hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavenger was confirmed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Challenge of both PAMs and PMMs with PRRSV genotype 1, subtypes 1, 2, and 3 and PMMs with PRRSV genotype 2 showed complete resistance to viral infections assessed by replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal microscopy revealed the absence of replication structures in the SRCR5 CD163 deletion macrophages, indicating an inhibition of infection prior to gene expression, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  at entry/fusion or unpacking stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome is an endemic infectious disease of pigs, manifesting differently in pigs of different ages but primarily causing late-term abortions and stillbirths in sows and respiratory disease in piglets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The causative agent of the disease is the positive-strand RNA PRRS virus (PRRSV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PRRSV only infects a specific subset of cells of the innate immune system of the monocyte/macrophage lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous research found that the virus needs a specific receptor, CD163, in order to make its own membrane fuse with the host cell membrane in an uptake vesicle to release the viral genetic information into the cytosol and achieve a successful infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD163 has a pearl-on-a-string structure, whereby the pearl/ domain number 5 was found to interact with the virus and allow it to infect a cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe how we generated pigs lacking the CD163 subdomain 5 using so-called CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in zygotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pigs were healthy under normal husbandry conditions and other biological functions conducted by the CD163 were found to be intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We isolated a variety of monocyte and macrophage cells from these pigs and found them to be completely resistant to PRRSV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically important infectious diseases affecting pigs worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mystery swine disease was first observed almost simultaneously in North America and in Europe in the late 1980s [1,2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The causative agent of PRRS was identified to be a virus later named PRRS virus (PRRSV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infected pigs may present with symptoms involving inappetence, fever, lethargy, and respiratory distress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the most devastating effects of PRRSV infection are observed in young piglets and pregnant sows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pregnant sows an infection with PRRSV can cause a partial displacement of the placenta, leading to full abortions or to death and mummification of fetuses in utero [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Late-term abortions occur in up to 30% of infected sows with litters containing up to 100% stillborn piglets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live-born piglets from an antenatal infection are often weak and display severe respiratory symptoms, with up to 80% of them dying on a weekly basis pre-weaning [4,5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young piglets infected with PRRSV often display diarrhea and severe respiratory distress caused by lesions in the lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pre-weaned piglets the infection may be transmitted via the mammary gland secretions of an infected sow [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this age the infection has a fatal outcome in up to 80% of animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After weaning mortality rates reduce, but continued economic losses due to reduced daily gain and feed efficiency are often observed [4,7,8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to reduction or loss of pregnancies, death in young piglets, and decreased growth rates in all PRRSV infected pigs it is estimated that more than $650m are lost annually to pork producers in the United States alone [9,10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PRRSV is an enveloped, plus-strand RNA virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family in the order Nidovirales [11,12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PRRSV genome (~15 kb) encodes at least 12 non-structural and seven structural proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The viral RNA is packaged by the nucleocapsid protein N, which is surrounded by the lipoprotein envelope, containing the non-glycosylated membrane proteins M and E, as well as four glycosylated glycoproteins GP2, GP3, GP4, and GP5, whereby GP2, 3, and 4 form a complex [1317].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PRRSV has a very narrow host range, infecting only specific subsets of porcine macrophages [1820].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unknown yet how widespread PRRSV infections are within the superfamily of the Suoidea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereby European wild boars have been shown to act as a reservoir for PRRSV [21], little is known about infection in African suids, such as bushpigs and warthogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro virus replication is supported by the African Green Monkey cell line MARC-145.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Entry of PRRSV into macrophages has been shown to occur via pH-dependent, receptor mediated endocytosis [22,23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various attachment factors and receptors have been indicated to be involved in the PRRSV entry process (reviewed in [24]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heparan sulphate was identified early as an attachment factor of the virus [2527].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro infection of pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) but not MARC-145 cells was shown to be inhibited by an antibody targeting CD169 (sialoadhesin), a lectin expressed on the surface of macrophages [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of CD169 in previously non-permissive PK-15 cells showed internalization but not productive replication of PRRSV [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, an in vivo challenge of genetically modified pigs in which the CD169 gene had been knocked out revealed no increased resistance to PRRSV infection, suggesting that CD169 is an attachment factor that is not essential for PRRSV infection [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though cell surface protein expression is a major determinant of PRRSV binding and internalization, there appears to be a redundancy amongst cell surface attachment factors, with the potential for additional, as yet unidentified receptors, being involved [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scavenger receptor CD163, also known as haptoglobin scavenger receptor or p155, is expressed on specific subtypes of macrophages and has been identified as a fusion receptor for PRRSV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracellular portion of CD163 forms a pearl-on-a-string structure of nine scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains and is anchored by a single transmembrane segment and a short cytoplasmic domain [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD163 has a variety of biological functions, including mediating systemic inflammation and the removal of hemoglobin from blood plasma (reviewed in [33,34]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of CD163 renders non-susceptible cells permissive to PRRSV infection [35], whereby it was found that CD163 does not mediate internalization but is crucial for fusion [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transmembrane anchoring and an interaction with the SRCR domain 5 (SRCR5) of CD163 were found to be essential for successful infection with PRRSV [34,35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent in vivo experiments with CD163 knock-out pigs confirmed that CD163 is required for PRRSV infection [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as CD163 has important biological functions the complete knockout could have a negative physiological impact on the animal, particularly with respect to inflammation and/or infection by other pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, whereas all the other eight SRCR domains have been shown to be involved in different biological functions, no specific role has been associated with SRCR5, other than in PRRSV infection [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this study aimed to generate pigs with a defined CD163 SRCR5 deletion and to assess the susceptibility of macrophages from these pigs to PRRSV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Generation_of_live_CD163_SRCR5_deletion_pigs_by_CRISPR_Cas9_editing_in_zygotes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CD163 gene is not correctly represented in the current pig reference genome sequence (Sscrofa10.2) [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through targeted sequencing we established a detailed model of the porcine CD163 locus (S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, CD163 is encoded by 16 exons with exons 213 predicted to encode the SRCR domains of the protein [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, SRCR5 is predicted to be encoded by one single exon, namely exon 7 (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an editing strategy was developed to excise exon 7 using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system [40,41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of two guide RNAs, one located in the intron 5 to exon 7 and one in the short intron between exons 7 and 8 was predicted to generate a deletion of exon 7, whilst allowing appropriate splicing of the remaining exons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the short length of the intron between exons 7 and 8 (97 bp) only one suitably unique targeting sequence (crRNA) with a corresponding protospacer adjacent motif was identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three candidate crRNA sequences were selected in the immediate upstream area of exon 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All four sequences were assessed in vitro for cutting efficiency by transfection of porcine kidney PK15 cells with a plasmid based on px458 [42] encoding the complete single guide sequence (sgRNA), driven by the hU6 promoter, and a CAG promoter driving NLS-Cas9-2A-GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfected cells were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for GFP and cutting efficiency at the target site was assessed using a Cel1 surveyor assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three out of four guides were shown to direct cutting of DNA as anticipated (2 upstream and one downstream of exon 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following double transfection assay and subsequent PCR analysis it was found that only the combination of guides SL26 and SL28 generated the desired exon 7 deletion in the CD163 gene (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results the guide combination of sgSL26 and sgSL28 was used for in vivo experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
sgRNAs SL26 and SL28 were microinjected together with mRNA encoding the Cas9 nuclease into the cytosol of zygotes (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Editing efficiency was assessed in a small number of injected zygotes by in vitro culture to the blastocyst stage, genomic DNA extraction, whole genome amplification and PCR amplification across exon 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis revealed that two out of 17 blastocysts contained a deletion of the intended size and Sanger sequencing confirmed the deletion of exon 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Edited blastocyst B2 showed a clean deletion and subsequent re-ligation at the cutting sites of sgSL26 and sgSL28, whilst edited blastocyst B14 showed that in addition to the intended deletion there was also a random insertion of 25 nucleotides at the target site (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the full length PCR products showed nucleotide mismatches at either cutting site in a T7 endonuclease assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall editing rate in the blastocysts was 11.7%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate live pigs, 2439 zygotes injected with sgSL26, sgSL28, and Cas9 mRNA were transferred into the oviduct of recipient gilts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 32 live piglets were born and genotyping of ear and tail biopsies revealed that four of the piglets had an exon 7 deletion, corresponding to 12.5% of the total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the intended deletion of exon 7, three out of the four animals showed insertions of new DNA at the target site probably as a consequence of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pig 347 showed a 2 bp truncation at the sgSL26 cutting site and a 66 bp insertion between the cutting sites, pig 346 showed a deletion of 304 bp after the cutting site of sgSL26, and pig 310 showed a short 9 bp insertion at the cutting sites (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pig 345 was found to have a precise deletion of exon 7 without insertion or deletion of random nucleotides at the cut sites (S2B & S2D Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly PCR amplification indicated that pigs 310, 345, and 347 were all mosaic for an editing event, with pig 310 having a low frequency heterozygous (one allele edited) compared to unedited cells, whilst pigs 345 and 347 have both homozygous (both alleles edited) and heterozygous cell types (S2A & S2C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genotype_and_phenotype_of_F1_generation_pigs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate fully homozygous and heterozygous pigs, 310 was mated with 345.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mating yielded a litter of 6 heterozygous, 2 biallelic/homozygous CD163 SRCR5 deletion (SRCR5), and 4 wild type CD163 piglets (S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing of the animals revealed all the heterozygotes to have inherited their edited allele from 345.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pig 629 was found to be biallelic for the exon 7 deletion with one allele carrying the genotype of 345 and the other allele the one from 310.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly 630 was found to be homozygous for the edited allele with the 9 bp insert between the cutting sites of sgSL26 and sgSL28 as found in the 310 founder / parent (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that this homozygous state has arisen from a gene conversion event in the zygote.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals 627, 628, 629, 630, 633, and 634 were selected for further analysis, representing the various genotypes (wild type, heterozygous, and biallelic/homozygous) and genders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth rates of both SRCR5 and heterozygous animals were comparable to wild type animals (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood samples were taken from all six animals at 10 weeks of age and analyzed by a full blood count conducted by the diagnostics laboratory at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Edinburgh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blood counts of all animals were within reference values (S1 table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Size, stature and other morphological features of SRCR5 and heterozygous pigs were comparable to their wild type siblings (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At 8 weeks of age, pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were isolated from all six animals by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was extracted from the PAMs and analyzed by PCR and Sanger sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PAM genotype confirmed the results obtained from the ear biopsies; 628 and 633 were wild type, 627 and 633 heterozygous, and 629 and 630 SRCR5, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing of PCR products confirmed that all editing events had resulted in complete deletion of exon 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst pigs 627 and 633 had a clean deletion of exon 7 with precise religation at the sgSL26 and sgSL28 cutting sites in one allele, 629 had one allele with a clean deletion and one allele with a 9 bp insertion between the sites, and pig 630 had both alleles with the 9 bp insertion (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was extracted from the PAMs, converted into cDNA using oligo(dT) primed reverse transcription, amplified by PCR and analyzed by Sanger sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR products spanning exons 4 to 9 showed the expected 315 bp deletion in both heterozygous and SRCR5 animals (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third fragment situated between the full length and exon 7 deletion band in 627 and 634 was confirmed to be a hybrid of the full length and the exon 7 deletion fragment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that deletion of exon 7 has not disrupted the use of the correct splice acceptor site of exon 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of CD163 protein was assessed by western blot of PAM lysate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wild type pigs 628 and 633 expressed the full length protein with a predicted size of 120 kDa but is described to run at roughly 150 kDa [43], likely due to glycosylation, whereby a protein band at roughly 100 kDa may indicate the expression of another isoform, which could correspond to the described human isoform CRA_a or CRA_b (GenBank references EAW88664.1 and EAW88666.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterozygous animals 627 and 634 express both the full-length and the SRCR5 protein (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The band of the full-length protein is clearly stronger, indicating either higher expression of the full-length gene or increased binding of the full-length protein by the polyclonal CD163 antibody used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further examine this, gene expression was quantified by RT-qPCR on RNA extracted from PAMs and normalized to -actin expression, demonstrating no significant difference in total CD163 mRNA expression between wild type, heterozygous and SRCR5 animals (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Macrophages_of_SRCR5_pigs_are_fully_differentiated_and_express_macrophage-specific_surface_proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the differentiation potential of monocytes into CD163-expressing macrophages we isolated peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) from whole blood and then differentiated them into macrophages by CSF1-induction for seven days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of macrophage specific markers was assessed by immunofluorescence labelling and FACS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD14 and CD16 levels are clear indicators of the differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes with levels of both increasing significantly upon differentiation [44,45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD14/CD16 staining of the PMMs from the SRCR5, heterozygous, and wild type animals were all within the previously observed and documented levels [46], with difference being observed between the various genotypes (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD172a, also known as SIRP , is expressed at high levels on both monocytes and macrophages [45] and was expressed at high levels in cells from all animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD169, described as an attachment factor for PRRSV [29], is not expressed in monocytes but is highly expressed in tissue macrophages [47] and was expressed at expected levels in cells from our animals (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional differentiation marker found to be expressed on PMMs is SWC9, also known as CD203a, as well as the putative PRRSV attachment factor CD151 [48,49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of SWC9 highlighted the full differentiation of the PMMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD151 expression together with the previously shown CD169 expression demonstrated that both putative PRRSV attachment factors or receptors are still expressed on macrophages from SRCR5 animals (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in humans, expression of CD163 in pigs is restricted to monocytes and macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD163 is expressed at high levels in tissue macrophages, but at low levels in blood monocytes and in bone marrow-derived macrophages [50] (porcine macrophage markers are reviewed in [51]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the wild type and the SRCR5 CD163 were recognized on the surface of the PAMs (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the SRCR5 version of CD163 is likely to be properly folded as the clone 2A10/11 antibody only recognizes the protein in a non-reduced, native conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medians of CD163 fluorescence intensity of pigs 628, 633, 627, 634, 629, 630 were 23.3, 16.7, 18.3, 16.5, 18.8, and 17.2, respectively, with the isotype control medians ranging from 1.883.79.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, PBMCs isolated from all animals, independent of their genotype were shown to be fully differentiated into PMMs upon CSF1 induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They all expressed macrophage-specific surface markers, including CD169, CD151, and CD163, which have putative functions in PRRSV entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm the results from the in vitro differentiation PAMs were isolated by BAL and characterized for the expression of macrophage-specific surface proteins CD14, CD16, CD169, CD172a, and CD163 as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD14/CD16 staining of the PAMs from the SRCR5, heterozygous, and wild type animals were all within the previously observed and documented levels [46] (S4A Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also CD169 and CD172a were within expected levels, confirming full differentiations (S4B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medians of CD163 fluorescence intensity of pigs 628, 633, 627, 634, 629, 630 were 35.9, 22.7, 26.4, 24.4, 17.9, and 26.7, respectively, with isotype control medians ranging from 2.133.84 (S4C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates slightly higher expression levels of CD163 on PAMs compared to PMMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, PAMs isolated from all animals, independent of their genotype were shown to be fully differentiated and to express macrophage-specific surface markers, including CD169 and CD163, which have implicated functions in PRRSV entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SRCR5_macrophages_are_not_susceptible_to_infection_with_PRRSV_genotype_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PRRSV has two different genotypes with distinct geographic distribution, with genotype 1 being found primarily in Europe and Asia and genotype 2 in the Americas and Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two genotypes show differences in both antigenicity and severity of pathology and show an evolutionary divergence of  greater than 15% on a whole genome scale and 40% on the nucleotide level between them (reviewed in [52]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotype 1 can be further divided into three subtypes, based on the ORF7 sequence and geographical distribution, whereby subtype 1 is pan-European whilst subtypes 2 and 3 are currently limited to Eastern Europe [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we tested all genotype 1 subtypes of PRRSV, represented by subtype 1 strain H2 (PRRSV H2) [54], subtype 2 strain DAI (PRRSV DAI) [55], and subtype 3 strain SU1-Bel (PRRSV SU1-Bel) [56], originally isolated from the UK, Lithuania, and Belarus, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PAMs were infected at an MOI = 1 in a single-round infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19 hours post inoculation (hpi) the cells were harvested and stained with a FITC-labelled antibody against PRRSV-N protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection levels were assessed by FACS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three virus subtypes resulted in infection levels of 4060% in wild type and heterozygous animals, with more than 98% of infected cells being classified as CD163 positive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A slightly higher, statistically significant infection was observed in heterozygous animals infected with PRRSV H2 and DAI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for this is unclear, but may reflect either altered CD163 protein expression profile in heterozygous animals or other, as yet unidentified, genetic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, cells from both SRCR5 animals (629 and 630) were found to be highly resistant to infection in this assay (Fig 5A5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second assay was performed to assess whether virus could replicate in PAMs then infect neighboring cells in a multiple-round infection time course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were inoculated at MOI = 0.1 and supernatant samples collected at indicated time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatants and analyzed by RT-qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For PRRSV H2 and SU1-Bel specific probes and primers against ORF7 were employed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify PRRSV DAI vRNA specific primers against ORF5 and BRYT green dye binding were used due to the limited genome information available on this strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All wild type and heterozygous animals replicated the virus to similar levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus levels started to rise by 12 hpi and increased exponentially up to 36 hpi when they plateaued.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PRRSV SU1-Bel levels reached their plateau at 48 hpi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantification limit of the RT-qPCR corresponded to a CT value of 35, which corresponded to 1E4 TCID50/ml for PRRSV H2, 1E3 TCID50/ml for PRRSV DAI, and 5E3 for PRRSV SU1-Bel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  vRNA levels in supernatants from SRCR5 PAMs in this multiple round infection did not increase above the quantification limit (Fig 5D5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to assess whether infectious virions were produced a TCID50 assay was conducted on supernatant collected at 48 hpi, when all three subtypes had reached a plateau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serial dilutions were started at a 1:10 dilution, corresponding to a detection limit of 63 TCID50/ml.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus produced from PAMs of wild type or heterozygous origin was infectious and levels measured were comparable to those calculated for the vRNA extractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, homozygous SRCR5 PAMs did not support virus production at the detection limit of this assay (Fig 5G5J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, PAMs from SRCR5 animals could not be infected by PRRSV genotype I at a high MOI nor did they replicate the virus over a 72 h time course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore the possibility that PMMs could be a suitable alternative to monitor PRRSV infection and investigate whether SRCR5 PMMs, like PAMs, are resistant to PRRSV infection we tested infectivity with all three genotype 1 subtypes of PRRSV, represented by the strains described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PMMs were infected and assessed as described for PAMs above in both single-round infections (S5AS5C Fig) and multiple-round infections (S5DS5F Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results obtained from PMMs confirmed the ones obtained in PAMs as no replication of PRRSV was observed in cells from SRCR5 animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, PMMs replicated all viruses to higher levels than PAMs, suggesting that PMMs are not only suitable but may in fact be a superior model for in vitro infection studies with PRRSV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As there could be a genetic variation of CD163 within the Suidae superfamily we performed an in vitro control experiment to assess the susceptibility of warthog (Phacocherus africanus) PMMs to PRRSV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, warthog PMMs were found to be as susceptible to infection with all PRRSV genotype 1 subtypes as the pig PMMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They all replicated the virus at a similar rate and to comparable titers (S6 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also shows that the virus poses a threat to African pig breeding countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To assess the infectability of the SRCR5 macrophages with the Asian/American genotype 2 of the virus we selected two strains associated with high virulence, pathology, morbidity and mortality; strain VR-2385, isolated in Iowa in 1992 [57] and MN184, isolated in Minnesota in 2001 [58], (both kindly provided by Prof. Tanja Opriessnig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PMMs from the different CD163 genotypes were subjected to a multiple-round infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, cells were inoculated at MOI = 0.1 and supernatant samples collected throughout the progression of infection at 6, 24, 32, 48, and 72 hpi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatants and analyzed by RT-qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Virus levels for both strains started to rise after the 6 hpi time point and increased exponentially up to 32 hpi when they plateaued (Fig 6A & 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The virus amplification in the male homozygous and heterozygous macrophages appears to reach higher levels for strain VR-2385, whereby no difference could be observed for strain MN184.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantification limit of the RT-qPCR for VR-2385 was found to be at a CT value of 32, which corresponded to 3E2 TCID50/ml, for MN184 the quantification limit was at CT value of 36, corresponding to 25 TCID50/ml.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  vRNA levels in supernatants from SRCR5 PMMs in this multiple round infection did not increase above the quantification limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No replication of PRRSV was observed in SRCR5 animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_arrest_in_infection_of_SRCR5_pulmonary_alveolar_macrophages_(PAMs)_occurs_prior_to_the_formation_of_the_replication_transcription_complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the porcine kidney cell line PK-15, lacking CD163 expression, transfected with the PRRSV attachment factor CD169 the virus was found to be internalized but not to undergo uncoating [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that CD163, in a close interplay with attachment/internalization factors, plays a major role in the fusion of PRRSV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether the infection process in SRCR5 macrophages is arrested prior to replication we inoculated PAM cells with all three PRRSV genotype 1 subtypes, represented by the strains described above, at MOI = 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inoculum was removed 3 hpi and infection allowed to continue up to 22 hpi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were fixed and stained for the replication-transcription complexes (RTC) formed by PRRSV upon replication initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PRRSV nsp2 protein, involved in the formation of double membrane vesicles (reviewed in [59]) was chosen as a representative marker for the RTC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were permeabilized and stained for the presence of PRRSV nsp2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that macrophages from both the wild type and the heterozygous animals infected with PRRSV formed RTCs, independent of the subtype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the macrophages from SRCR5 animals no RTC formation was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative for all strains the SU1-Bel infection is shown in Fig 7, a figure of all infections may be found in S7 Fig This underlines the involvement of CD163 in the entry and uncoating process of PRRSV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also supports the deletion of SRCR5 as an effective method to abrogate PRRSV infection before the virus or viral proteins are amplified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SRCR5_peripheral_blood_monocyte-derived_macrophages_still_function_as_CD163-dependent_hemoglobin-haptoglobin_scavengers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to its contribution to PRRSV susceptibility, CD163 has been described to have a variety of important biological functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD163 is an erythroblast binding factor, enhancing the survival, proliferation and differentiation of immature erythroblasts, through association with SRCR domain 2 and CD163-expressing macrophages also clear senescent and malformed erythroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SRCR domain 3 plays a crucial role as a hemoglobin (Hb)-haptoglobin (Hp) scavenger receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free Hb is oxidative and toxic; once complexed with Hp it is cleared through binding to SRCR3 on the surface of macrophages and subsequent endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prevents oxidative damage, maintains homeostasis, and aids the recycling of iron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, CD163 was also shown to interact with HMGB1-haptoglobin complexes and regulate the inflammatory response in a heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1) dependent manner [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD163-expressing macrophages were also found to be involved in the clearance of a cytokine named TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), with all SRCRs apart from SRCR5 being involved in this process [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soluble CD163 can be found at a high concentration in blood plasma but its function in this niche is still partially unknown (reviewed in [34,62]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a recent publication by Akahori et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  showed the TWEAK interaction of CD163 to be involved in ischaemic injury tissue regeneration [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maintaining these biological functions is likely to be crucial to the production of healthy, genetically edited animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, none of the biological functions assigned to CD163 have yet been linked to SRCR5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to confirm whether SRCR5 macrophages were still able to take up Hb-Hp complexes we performed a variety of in vitro experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hb-Hp complex uptake in PMMs in vitro has been investigated extensively in the past, with PMMs able to take up both Hb and Hb-Hp complexes in a CD163-dependent manner and the inducible form of heme oxygenase, HO-1, being upregulated upon Hb-Hp uptake [64,65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PBMCs were differentiated into PMMs by CSF1-induction for seven days, following which PMMs were incubated in the presence of Hb-Hp for 24 h to stimulate HO-1 upregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HO-1 mRNA upregulation, assessed by RT-qPCR, increased 2- to 6-fold in the PMMs from all animals (Fig 8A) with no significant difference between the different genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess HO-1 levels by western blotting PMMs were incubated in the presence of Hb-Hp for 24 h, lysed using reducing Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of HO-1 were assessed using a monoclonal antibody against the protein, with a monoclonal antibody against calmodulin as a loading control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HO-1 protein expression was found to be upregulated in all animals, independent of CD163 genotype (Fig 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the uptake of Hb-Hp directly Hb was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PMMs were incubated with HbAF488-Hp for 30 min and followed by FACS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent of the CD163 genotype, HbAF488-Hp was taken up efficiently by the PMMs with medians of green fluorescence being 329, 305, 329, 366, 340, and 405 for animals 628, 633, 627, 634, 629, and 630, respectively, whilst the background mock-treated cell medians ranged from 2.414.74 (Fig 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uptake of HbAF488-Hp into the PMMs was confirmed by confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a further experiment PMMs were incubated with HbAF488-Hp for 30 min, followed by fixation and staining for CD163.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HbAF488-Hp was found in distinct spots, presumably endosomes, with no obvious co-localization with CD163 (Representative animals wild type 628 and SRCR5 630 shown in Fig 8D, all animals shown in S8 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of co-localization is not surprising as the majority of HbAF488-Hp complexes observed were likely already located in late endosomes and lysosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this data demonstrates that macrophages from SRCR5 animals retain the ability to perform their role as hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavengers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of this study show that live pigs carrying a CD163 SRCR5 deletion are healthy and maintain the main biological functions of the protein, whilst the deletion renders target cells of PRRSV resistant to infection with the virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using two sgRNAs flanking exon 7 of CD163 in CRISPR/Cas9 editing in zygotes we achieved excision of this exon from the genome of pigs yielding a CD163 SRCR5 genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of the truncated gene was confirmed by PCR of cDNA, RT-qPCR and western blotting against CD163.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macrophages isolated from the lungs of wild type CD163, heterozygous and SRCR5 animals showed full differentiation and expression of macrophage surface markers characteristic of macrophages isolated from the pulmonary alveolar areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assessing infection of PAMs from the different genotype animals in both high dose, single-round infections and low dose, multiple-round infections showed PAMs from SRCR5 pigs to be resistant to infection in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differentiation ability of cells of the monocytes/macrophages lineage from genetically edited CD163 animals was further confirmed by isolation and differentiation of PBMCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PMMs from SRCR5 pigs were also shown to be resistant to PRRSV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PMMs have a crucial biological role, serving as scavengers for Hb-Hp complexes in the blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using uptake experiments of fluorescently labelled Hb-Hp complexes as well as gene upregulation assays to monitor the increase of HO-1 upon Hb-Hp stimulation we confirmed that this important biological function is maintained in macrophages isolated from SRCR5 animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using CRISPR/Cas9 editing in zygotes we generated live pigs with exon 7 CD163 deletions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Editing efficiency was highly variable, dependent on day of the procedure/surgery, in both in vitro cultivated blastocysts as well as born animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it needs to be considered that overall numbers are low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reagents used on the various surgery days were the same and both insemination and surgery times were kept consistent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are many elements in the genome editing process that rely on highly skilled personnel and technical reproducibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent developments in nucleic acid delivery methods for genome editing in zygotes may offer possible solutions to standardize the genome editing process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various groups recently reported successful genome editing by in vitro electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9 regents into zygotes isolated from mice and rats without the necessity to remove the zona pellucida [6668].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using electroporation to deliver genome editing reagents in vivo Takahasi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  showed high success with this method in mouse embryos after 1.6 days of gestation [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of in vitro electroporation could standardize the injection process and reduce the requirement for highly trained personnel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an alternative, in vivo electroporation would remove both the requirement for donor animals and the long handling process of zygotes prior to re-implantation, however this procedure has currently only been developed for mice and may prove difficult to adapt to the porcine system (reviewed in [70]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three out of four of the founder animals were found to be edited in a mosaic pattern, although again caution in over interpretation is to be advised due to the low numbers involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In animal 310 the mosaicism seems to result from a delayed activity of the CRISPR/Cas9 complex, resulting in an edit of one allele in a single cell at the 4- or 8-cell stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In animals 345 and 347 an initial editing event appears to occur in one allele at the 1-cell stage and a second editing event, modifying the second allele in one of the cells at the 2-cell stage, resulting in homozygous/heterozygous mosaic animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mosaicism has been observed in various studies employing injection of genome editors into porcine zygotes [7173].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asymmetric spreading of introduced mRNA seems unlikely following results of Sato et al., who performed in vitro EGFP mRNA injections using parthenogenetically activated porcine oocytes, whereby a relatively homogenous fluorescence pattern could be observed [73].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, mosaicism seems to result from Cas9 protein/sgRNA complexes remaining active throughout several cell divisions or delayed mRNA expression possibly triggered by cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former theory is supported by the genotype of 345 and 347, which very likely have developed from an initial editing step in one allele at the one cell stage and editing of the second allele in one of the 2-cell or 4-cell stage cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate more biallelic animals by direct injection of zygotes, a more active reagent set is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies indicate that injection of Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) is more efficient than mRNA injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, RNP injection can be combined with in vitro electroporation [74].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mating of the F0 generation animals 310 and 345 resulted in wild type, heterozygous and biallelic edited animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This showed that despite mosaicism both animals are germline heterozygous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the offspring showed any adverse effect from the genome editing under standard husbandry conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the genotype of one of the animals, 630, was consistent with a gene conversion event at the edited CD163 locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the mechanism of interallelic gene conversion we assume that a homologous recombination occurred in this animal between one allele showing the edited genotype of 345 and the other allele the edited genotype of 310.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene conversion appears to have occurred at the zygote stage, rendering 630 homozygous for the genotype of 310 (reviewed in [75]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PRRSV shows a very narrow host cell tropism, only infecting specific porcine macrophage subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolating these cells from the F1 generation offspring of our genetically edited animals and their wild type siblings we showed that removal of the CD163 SRCR5 domain results in complete resistance of the macrophages towards PRRSV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrated that macrophages from SRCR5 animals are not only resistant to infection with all European subtypes of genotype 1 but also highly pathogenic and highly virulent strains of the Asian/American genotype 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that a targeted removal of SRCR5 is sufficient to achieve complete resistance to PRRSV infection in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PRRSV attachment factors CD151 and CD169 are still expressed on SRCR5 macrophages underlining that these proteins are not sufficient for PRRSV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PRRSV infection on macrophages from the SRCR5 animals was halted before the formation of replication transcription complexes proving CD163 to be involved in the entry or uncoating stage of the PRRSV replication cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SRCR5 macrophages will provide a new tool to study this process in detail in a true-to-life system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SRCR5 animals have several advantages over previously described genome edited animals resistant to PRRSV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whitworth et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  generated animals with a premature stop codon in exon 3 of the CD163 gene, resulting in an ablation of CD163 expression [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another recent publication the group replaced the SRCR5 of the porcine CD163 with the human CD163-L1 (hCD163-L1) domain SRCR8, utilizing the strategy employed by van Gorp et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in their in vitro studies of the PRRSV-CD163 interaction [76,77].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when replacing the SRCR5 with hCD163-L1 SRCR8 the resulting pigs were found to be susceptible to PRRSV genotype 2 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to both approaches we have demonstrated that specific application of genome editing tools in vivo can be used to efficiently generate PRRSV genotype 1 and genotype 2 resistant animals with precise deletion of exon 7 of CD163, and that these animals retain expression of the remainder of the CD163 protein on the surface of specific differentiated macrophages in a native confirmation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further showed that the macrophages from these SRCR5 animals retain full differentiation potential, both in PAMs as well as PBMCs stimulated to differentiate by CSF-1 addition, and that macrophages from edited animals retain the ability to perform crucial biological functions associated with CD163 expression, such as hemoglobin-haptoglobin uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, SRCR5 animals are not transgenic in contrast to hCD163-L1 SRCR8 replacement animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hCD163-L1 SRCR8 animals or any variation thereof, which would render the animals resistant to PRRSV genotype 2 as well as genotype 1, bear another risk, which is the adaptation of the virus to the new amino acid sequence of the replacement SRCR domain, thereby turning into a potential human pathogen due to the human sequence used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A removal of SRCR5 has the advantage of removing the viruss target interaction sequence all together, thereby making it more difficult for the virus to adapt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this study demonstrates that it is possible to utilize a targeted genome editing approach to render livestock resistant to viral infection, whilst retaining biological function of the targeted gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introduction of CD163 SRCR5 deletion animals in pig breeding could significantly reduce the economic losses associated with PRRSV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Primary pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) for the propagation of PRRSV genotype 1, subtype 1 strain H2 (PRRSV H2) [54], subtype 2 strain DAI (PRRSV DAI) [55], and subtype 3 strain SU1-Bel (PRRSV SU1-Bel)[56] were harvested from wild type surplus research animals aged 69 weeks as previously described [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, animals were euthanized according to a schedule I method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lungs were removed and transferred on ice to a sterile environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PAMs were extracted from lungs by washing the lungs twice with warm PBS, massaging to release macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 400 x g. When necessary red cells were removed using red cell lysis buffer (10 mM KHCO3, 155 mM NH4Cl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 5 min before washing again with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were collected by centrifugation as before and frozen in 90% FBS (HI, GE Healthcare), 10% DMSO (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were frozen gradually at 1°C/min in a -80°C freezer before being transferred to -150°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotype 2 PRRSV strains VR-2385, isolated in Iowa in 1992 [57] and MN184, isolated in Minnesota in 2001 [58], (both kindly provided by Prof. Tanja Opriessnig [78]) were assessed for infectivity on PAM cells prior to use in infection experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PAMs from the animals 627, 628, 629, 630, 633, and 634 were collected at 8 weeks of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this the piglets were sedated using a Ketamine/Azaperone pre-medication mix and anaesthetized with Ketamine/Midazolam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anesthesia throughout the procedure was maintained using Sevoflurane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PAMs were collected by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) through an intubation with an air flow access.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three lung segments were flushed in each animal using 2 x 20 ml PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluid recovery was between 6080%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10min at 400g from the BAL fluid and frozen as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) were isolated as described previously [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, blood was collected using EDTA coated vacuum tubes from the jugular vein of the piglets at 10 weeks of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood was centrifuged at 1200 x g for 15 min and buffy coat transferred to PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield) was overlaid with an equal volume of buffy coat/PBS and centrifuged for 45 min at 400 x g. The mononuclear cell fraction was washed with PBS, cells collected and frozen as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PAM cells were cultivated in RPMI-1640, Glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% FBS (HI, GE Healthcare), 100IU/ml penicillin and 100g/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) (cRPMI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PBMCs were cultivated in cRPMI supplemented with rhCSF1 (1×104 units/ml; a gift from Chiron) for 6 days prior to infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PK15 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with Glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% FBS (HI, GE Healthcare), 100IU/ml penicillin and 100g/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Three potential guide RNA sequences were selected in the 200 bp of intron 6 and one in the 97 bp long intron 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oligomers (Invitrogen) were ordered, hybridized as previously described [79] then ligated into the BbsI sites of plasmid pSL66 (a derivative of px458 with modifications to the sgRNA scaffold as described by [42]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generated plasmids contain a hU6 promoter driving expression of the guide RNA sequence and a CBA promoter driving Cas9-2A-GFP with an SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the N-terminus and a nucleoplasmin NLS at the C-terminus of Cas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cutting efficiency of each guide was assessed by transfection of the plasmids into pig PK15 cells using a Neon transfection system (Invitrogen) set at 1400 mV with 2 pulses of 20 mS. 48 hours post-transfection GFP positive cells were collected using a FACS Aria III cell sorter (Becton Dickinson) and cultured for a further 4 days prior to preparation of genomic DNA (DNeasy Blood & Tissues Kit, Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR across the target sites was with oSL46 (ACCTTGATGATTGCGCTCTT) and oSL47 (TGTCCCAGTGAGAGTTGCAG) using AccuPrime Taq DNA polymerase HiFi (Life Technologies) to produce a product of 940 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A CelI assay (Transgenomic; Surveyor Mutation Detection Kit) was performed as previously described [80].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-transfection of PK15 cells with pairs of plasmids encoding guides flanking exon 7 were carried out as described above with the exception that cells were harvested at 40 hours post-transfection without enrichment for GFP expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this instance a truncated PCR product was observed in addition to the 940 bp fragment, indicating deletion of exon 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on both single and double cutting efficiencies guide RNAs SL26 (GAATCGGCTAAGCCCACTGT), located 121 bp upstream of exon 7, and SL28 (CCCATGCCATGAAGAGGGTA), located 30 bp downstream of exon 7 were selected for in vivo experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_guide_RNA_and_quality_assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#
