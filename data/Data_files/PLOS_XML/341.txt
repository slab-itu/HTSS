Crowdsourcing Language Change with Smartphone Applications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crowdsourcing linguistic phenomena with smartphone applications is relatively new.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In linguistics, apps have predominantly been developed to create pronunciation dictionaries, to train acoustic models, and to archive endangered languages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paper presents the first account of how apps can be used to collect data suitable for documenting language change: we created an app, Dialäkt Äpp (DÄ), which predicts users dialects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 16 linguistic variables, users select a dialectal variant from a drop-down menu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DÄ then geographically locates the users dialect by suggesting a list of communes where dialect variants most similar to their choices are used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Underlying this prediction are 16 maps from the historical Linguistic Atlas of German-speaking Switzerland, which documents the linguistic situation around 1950.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where users disagree with the prediction, they can indicate what they consider to be their dialects location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this information, the 16 variables can be assessed for language change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thanks to the playfulness of its functionality, DÄ has reached many users; our linguistic analyses are based on data from nearly 60,000 speakers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results reveal a relative stability for phonetic variables, while lexical and morphological variables seem more prone to change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crowdsourcing large amounts of dialect data with smartphone apps has the potential to complement existing data collection techniques and to provide evidence that traditional methods cannot, with normal resources, hope to gather.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize a range of methodological caveats, including sparse knowledge of users linguistic backgrounds (users only indicate age, sex) and users self-declaration of their dialect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are discussed and evaluated in detail here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings remain intriguing nevertheless: as a means of quality control, we report that traditional dialectological methods have revealed trends similar to those found by the app.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This underlines the validity of the crowdsourcing method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are presently extending DÄ architecture to other languages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crowdsourcing, the practice of obtaining needed [] content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people and especially from the online community [], powerfully capitalizes on the fact that none of us is as smart as all of us [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crowdsourcing is not a new scientific phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ornithology, for example, the North American Christmas Bird Count is now in its 115th year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since 1900 the project has encouraged bird enthusiasts to count and record the number of birds of each species they witness on Christmas Day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2012, more than 70,000 people participated in this crowdsourcing project [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In linguistics, one of the first accounts of collecting dialect data in a crowdsourcing fashion was the German dialect survey conducted by Georg Wenker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wenker began documenting dialects in the late 19th century by distributing some 50,000 questionnaires with 40 test sentences to schoolmasters across Germany, achieving a 90% response rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The survey and responses were written in Standard German orthography as well as localized transcriptions and were collated, stored, and prepared for display on large paper maps [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cartographical structure for mapping dialectological evidence was born [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A century and a half later, paper is being replaced by online surveys and smartphone applications (apps) as a very powerful and flexible medium for crowdsourcing language data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Internet-based crowdsourcing has recently emerged as a means of collecting language data in speech science [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amazons Mechanical Turk [6], a key player in current crowdsourcing platforms, has been used extensively in recent years to collect data to develop the capabilities of human language technologies (for an overview paper see [7]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labor that cannot yet be conducted by computers is crowdsourced via so-called Turkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In natural language processing, this work principally involves the creation of speech and text annotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crowdsourcing data through mobile devices to study linguistic phenomena is even more recent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is surprising given both the increasing integration of voice-operated technology in mobile communication and the burgeoning number of mobile apps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Used as a medium for rapid, large-scale data collection, exciting opportunities arise for a wide range of cognate disciplines [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smartphones are ubiquitous, unobtrusive, and computationally powerful, offering vast potential for gathering data on the real-world behaviors of millions of people without requiring subjects to come into a lab [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smartphone apps have been used to create pronunciation dictionaries [10], collect speech as a means to train acoustic models for automatic speech recognition [11], document endangered languages [12] and gather grammaticality judgments [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more passive form of crowdsourcing, with subjects unaware of the scientific use of their data, is large-scale analysis of diatopic language variation using geotagged Twitter posts; one such study that used lexical parameters reports that the Spanish language is split into two superdialects, namely an urban variety used across major American and Spanish cities and a diverse form that encompasses rural areas and small towns [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this paper we demonstrate how crowdsourcing speech data with the smartphone app Dialäkt Äpp (hereafter DÄ; [15]) allows documentation of language change and areal variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DÄs main function is the prediction of a users home dialect location based on a 16-question survey pre-determined by phoneticians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the prediction, users can evaluate the result and indicate their real dialect location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Underlying the 16 questions are 16 maps from the Linguistic Atlas of German-speaking Switzerland (Sprachatlas der Deutschen Schweiz)hereafter referred to as the Atlaswhich documents the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland roughly 70 years ago in 560 localities [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether for educational or entertainment purposes, DÄ has been downloaded nearly 80,000 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feedback from nearly 60,000 users provides a contemporary snapshot of the Swiss German dialect landscape, which can be used to investigate diachronic variation by comparison with Atlas data [17, 18, 19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon its release, DÄ became the most downloaded free iPhone app in Switzerland [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The app also received broad media attention in German-speaking Europe: it remained in the top three German educational apps in Switzerland for several months and it was covered by 20 Minuten, the most popular Swiss daily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This attention is important, as it is an essential part in the success of crowdsourced projects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The potential to predict someones dialect location with such a tool has caught the publics interest not only in German-speaking Switzerland but also in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half a year after the release of DÄ, the New York Times published an online appthe Dialect quiz [20]that predicts the users American English dialect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quiz consists of 25 questions such as, What is your generic term for a sweetened carbonated beverage?.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The user provides their answer (pop, soda, coke, or other) and proceeds to the next question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the end, dialect location predictions are displayed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistics used to determine the prediction of dialect location are pre-calculated from self-reported responses in the Harvard Dialect Survey [21] in conjunction with a supplementary survey of 350,000 people [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though posted on the Times website within the last 10 days of 2013, this quiz became the years most popular piece of content [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is no small accomplishment: the Times is the most popular news website in America, accessed by over 30 million unique users per month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous research on Swiss German dialects using crowdsourced data is based on web surveys and is comparatively scant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest sample previously obtained in this way for Swiss German dialect data includes 14,000 speakers [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [25] crowdsourced lexical dialect data from more than 5,000 speakers and compared her results to those of the Atlas, finding a striking convergence towards Standard German.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  She further hypothesized that phonetic variables as elicited in the Atlas may have undergone less change than lexical variables (a finding reported in [26]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [25] further revealed, unsurprisingly, that younger speakers were more likely to deviate from the Atlas than older speakers (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [27]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present paper, we demonstrate that data collected through DÄ and subsequent diachronic analyses have the potential to shed considerable light on dialectal and linguistic diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In section 2 of this paper, we introduce how the app works and how we have applied it to the analysis of language change in German-speaking Switzerland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Section 3 shows results based on data elicited through DÄ, that are then discussed in section 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major part of the discussion is dedicated to highlighting the innovative nature of this approach to data collection and analysis while critically reflecting upon it as a dialect research methodology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Section 5 introduces the quality control we applied on the results presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The primary function of DÄ is the prediction of a users dialect location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is based on 16 discriminative maps of different linguistic variables, from [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we discuss the criteria according to which we selected the variables (2.1), the implementation of the prediction algorithm on a mobile platform (2.2), and how language change can be documented with the data collected (2.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An extensive description of DÄs further functionalities and the methods for implementing them is given in [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
21_Variable_selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the Atlas documented dialects spoken by mostly older people (the most common dialectological approach at the time) around 70 years ago, we selected linguistic variables that we assumed to still have relatively stable geographical distributions in order to get dialect prediction results as precise as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since previous research had shown that the isoglosses of some lexical variables had undergone major changes [25], we primarily selected phonetic variables, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  maps (see Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variables each showing different geographical distributions from the other were chosen so that very small areas could be distinguished from each other on the basis of a unique combination of variants across the set of variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overlaying only two variables with two variants each, for example, partitions the linguistic area into four quadrants (Fig 1, right): the variants for schneien to snow, for example, creates a northern and a southern area (Fig 1, left), while the variants for Bett bed splits Swiss German dialects into western and eastern variants (Fig 1, center).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 1 presents the 16 variables selected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Standard German word, the Middle High German root, example variants, the number of variants, and the type of variable (phonetic, morphological, or lexical) are indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphological variable upwards, for example, has 31 different variants, including embruf and uehi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16] categorized this as a morphological variable, probably because of its word formation nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One could also view the 31 variants for upwards as different lexical variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present contribution, we adhere to the original Atlas categorization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

22_Mobile_implementation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DÄ prompts users to select their pronunciation variant from a list for each of the 16 variables by tapping on the smartphone screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Swiss German does not have a standardized writing system, variants are spelled to approximate their pronunciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When variants cannot be written down because of only minor phonetic differences (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to ask (fraage [a], fraage []; see Fig 2, left), the app further shows phonetic transcriptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since users may not be accustomed to these symbols, we included audio recordings for all variants for each of the 16 words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each variable is presented on a single screen with the Standard German word in its title and dialectal variants listed underneath (Fig 2, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once users have indicated which variants of the 16 words they use, the app presents a list of five possible localities, out of a possible 550 adapted from the Atlas, that best correspond to their dialect (Fig 2, center) and displays these on a map (Fig 2, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atlas data from the 16 variables serve as the basis for the dialect prediction algorithm [16]: for each variant of the 16 variables, the Atlas contains data on the localities for which the variant is attested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The user input is then compared to this underlying data: a match is observed for a particular locality when the users variant for a variable is attested in this locality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our dialect prediction algorithm calculates scores per locality by aggregating, for each locality, the number of matches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The algorithm then presents the top five localities with the highest scores as best hits to the user [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

23_Comparing_Atlas_with_DÄ_data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to conduct analyses of language change on the basis of these data, we need users to provide feedback on the predicted dialect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If they believe the first locality in the result list to be accurate, users are shown a new screen informing them about how to support our research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By clicking on OK, Id like to help, users are prompted to indicate age and gender.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having done so, they once again verify their voluntary participation in our study by clicking on send to submit their data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In doing so they consent to sending off their data on variant selection, dialectal origin, gender, and age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is explained on the screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of these pieces of information individually or in combination allow for identification of a user in the database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Users also have the opportunity to decline in the first instance, in which case they are shown the results screen again (Fig 3, left and center left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If they feel the result is not accurate, users can specify their dialect by choosing from a list of cantons (administrative regions) and localities (Fig 3, center right), before indicating age and gender.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here too, users have to intentionally click on send to submit their data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In doing so they consent to sending off their data on variant selection, dialectal origin, gender, and age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is again explained on the screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both instancescorrect or false predictionthe location of a speakers actual dialect is elicited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This crowdsourced information can then be compared to the historical data in the Atlas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure of collecting and analyzing anonymous user data conforms to the regulations of the Zurich cantonal ethics committee (http://www.kek.zh.ch/internet/gesundheitsdirektion/kek/de/home.html) and the accompanying federal laws on experimentation on humans in Switzerland (http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20061313/index.html).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we did no seek further ethical approval from cantonal or federal institutional bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The localities provided in the drop-down list are identical to those used in the Atlas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows for direct cross-comparison between Atlas data and DÄ data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are, of course, communities that have merged or changed names in the past 60 years (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [30]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original Atlas locality set for German-speaking Switzerland was 560; that of DÄ is 10 localities fewer, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  550.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In 3.1 we discuss the descriptive statistics of the DÄ corpus, and 3.2 presents the results on the prediction accuracy of DÄ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rest of the results section is dedicated to an analysis of language change on the basis of the present data (3.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This includes analyses of variable types (3.3.1), the mapping of specific variables (3.3.2), the effects of the number of variants per variable (3.3.3), and of age on linguistic change (3.3.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dataset underlying these findings can be found in the Supporting Information (S1 Dataset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
31_Descriptive_Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

32_Prediction_accuracy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
30% of users were predicted in the correct locality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When simply considering the cantons and not the localities, the majority of users were predicted in the right canton (65%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of the number of users that were localized in the right canton, for each canton, was very similar to the distribution of the number of users per canton (2(324) = 342, p = .236).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This entails that the dialects of users from the different cantons were predicted similarly well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When comparing different age groups, the results reveal that prediction accuracy (on a cantonal level) increased with users age: the worst predictions were associated with speakers aged 1520 (59%), 2125 slightly better (64%), 2635 even better (66%), and 3660 (69%) the second best.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oldest speaker group (60+) was predicted the best with a rate of 71%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this section we touch upon the innovative aspects of our method (4.1) and the apps public reception (4.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is followed by a more thorough discussion of this studys main results: the apps prediction accuracy (4.3) and the evidence for language change (4.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that our method does not have a precedent, a large bulk of this discussion is dedicated to methodological considerations (4.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
41_The_innovative_aspect_of_crowdsourcing_language_change_with_an_app  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The use of crowdsourcing methods to investigate language change is, at present, unusual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, scholars of language variation and change work with very small samples of speakers (often fewer than 50), who have been carefully selected to meet a range of social profile criteria, and do so in one or just a few locationsrarely more (see the discussion, for example, in [33], about the impracticability of large random samples in traditional approaches to sociolinguistic dialectological fieldwork).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The search for authenticity has long preoccupied dialectologists, and consequently there has been a tendency in the discipline to favor both native and working-class speakers of the local dialect in an attempt to access a locations true vernacular speech (see, for example, [34, 35]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One consequence of such an approach is that while change at a very specific, local level is brought into sharp focus, a general overview at the regional or national level becomes impossible because of gaps in coverage and inconsistency in sampling strategies [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, attempts at securing a representative sample of a given population are beginning to be abandoned, largely due to the expense of securing a truly meaningful sample and the laborious and time-consuming analytical techniques usually applied to collected data [33, 37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some notable larger-scale projects that could be seen as crowdsourced include Labov, Ash and Bobergs phone survey for the Atlas of North American English [38], and, especially, Chambers Dialect Topography of Canadian English, a questionnaire-based survey of regional lexical and pronunciation differences that had, by 2006, been completed by over 6,000 people [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In studies of language change, these techniques are, however, the exception rather than the rule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crowdsourcing large amounts of dialect data has the potential to complement existing data collection techniques and to provide evidence that traditional methods cannot, with normal resources, hope to gather.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we will see, such techniques offer the opportunity to collect potentially representative samples cheaply and effectively and provide a geographical overview that smaller, more typical samples cannot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

42_Public_reception  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DÄ was well received in Switzerland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It peaked as the most downloaded app in the country for a few days in March 2013 and was the most downloaded educational app for several consecutive weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The app was extensively covered in daily and weekly newspapers, on Swiss National Radio, and Swiss National Television.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This buzz helped promote the app, which led to further recruiting of users, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  App-based experimenting creates its own dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Users were not offered any payment; pure enjoyment and curiosity about Swiss German dialects led them to participate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apps popularity is interesting as it is commonly assumed that users expect a gain for the time spent on crowdsourcing tasks [5, 40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DÄ was not designed as a task, but as playful software to communicate about science; so it seems that the task took on a form of enjoyment for the userswhich may have been even more effective at recruiting participants than a monetary incentive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

43_Prediction_accuracy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The evaluation of prediction accuracy was somewhat sobering: the narrowly-defined first-hit accuracy on the locality level was relatively low at 30%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accuracy at a broader cantonal leveltesting if the first hit was in the right cantonwas comparatively high at 65%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An abstraction to the cantonal level is justified insofar as dialect regions are not always clearly delineated in German-speaking Switzerland (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [41])a rule of thumb holds that the dialects are named according to the canton in which they are spoken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This recognition rate is remarkable, given that there are 19 German-speaking cantons, making the chance level 5.3% (= 1/19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of analysis is justified since DÄs prediction algorithm showed a similar performance for every cantonal dialect (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This semi-automatic dialect recognition performs better than human dialect recognition: for Swiss German, [42, 43] showed that naïve listeners can accurately recognize another speakers dialect with a recognition rate of 86% and 74%, in a four and eight alternative forced choice task, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is 86% when chance level is 25% (= 1/4) and 74% when chance level is 12.5% (= 1/8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other languages, however, dialect recognition tends to be more difficult: [44] report human identification rates of 3050% for American and British English dialects; [45] report similar recognition rates for German dialects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tendency for younger speakers to have poorer DÄ prediction rates than older speakers is intuitively sound [27]: The older speakers can be expected to be closer, in their speech, to the Atlas informants, on which DÄs prediction algorithm is based.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [25] found older speakers to have higher Atlas agreement scores in her sample of 5,500 speakers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Swiss German, studies have reported that younger speakers are more linguistically flexible, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  younger speakers tend to use more geographically diverse features than older speakers [26, 46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, too, there was a tendency for older speakers to have higher Atlas agreement scores (Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

44_Language_change  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mismatches between the Atlas data and self-reported data from the app suggests linguistic change in progress, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  that a dialect has changed between the Atlas and now.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported results therefore point to significant language change over the past 70 years, whether on a phonetic, lexical, or morphological level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can speculate as to the causes of this change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greater speaker mobility increases the range of variants that speakers may come into contact with, favoring the transmission chances of more frequently used and geographically more widespread variants over rarer and more isolated forms [47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Swiss German speakers increased tendency to send text messages and contribute to social media in dialect may also increase speakers contact with a diverse range of linguistic variants [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some have argued [48], though not without controversy (see [49] and the series of discussant papers thereafter), that mass media may contribute to language change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results further reveal a possible scaling of variables in language change: phonetic variables seem to be less affected than lexical ones, a finding also attested elsewhere [50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lexical variable Apfelüberrest (apple core) showed an agreement with the Atlas of 53%; that is, nearly half of our respondents chose a different variant from the one indicated in the Atlas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phonetic variables, on the other hand, seem to be more stable, with 67% of speakers still adhering to forms documented for that location in the Atlas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [26] has previously shown that for Swiss German, phonetic variables seem to be more resilient against language change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed analyses of Apfelüberrest apple core and heben (to lift) exemplify this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bütschgi, one variant of Apfelüberrest, is clearly gaining ground and spreading, while heben is an example of a phonetic variable that has remained relatively geographically stable over the past 70 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings have to be interpreted cautiously, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were only one lexical and one morphological variable included in the sample, while phonetic variables make up 14 of the 16 investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides, results reveal a slight trend showing that the more variants a variable has, the lower the Atlas agreement scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may, on the one hand, have to do with the fact that users were overwhelmed with the number of variants to choose from and had difficulties telling apart the fine-grained phonetic differences, but, on the other, may simply be a reflection of a trend, in the context of increasing mobility, to level away extreme dialect diversity [36, 51].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, it is the variables Abend (vowel) evening (eight variants), schneien to snow (seven variants), and Augen eyes (eleven variants) that exhibit the lowest Atlas agreement scores (see Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

45_Methodological_considerations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are a number of methodological issues that warrant further discussion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this study need to be interpreted against the backdrop of these limitations:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Quality_Control_and_Validating_the_App_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies that use a crowdsourcing methodology need to pay particular attention to quality control in their data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are a number of protocols that can be applied to eliminate noise and filter bad judgments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example: do average user results compare similarly to how experts, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  linguists or phoneticians, would respond [5]?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the data of one user can be compared to that of another user.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An early-stage mechanism for improving the quality of data is the calculation of regional averages, for example, or eliminating outliers [65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the current study, most of these methods are not applicable, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outliers can be excluded and means can be calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But it is hardly telling to compare one user set to that of another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experts, too, cannot really help with the validation process, given that each speakers linguistic biography is different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying various other dialectological methods, however, can validate or falsify results obtained with crowdsourcing [65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to scrutinize the validity of the DÄ corpus, therefore, we decided to examine one particular linguistic variable that has received recent and thorough geolinguistic investigation in Swiss Germanthe spread of /l/ vocalization, as described in 3.3.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By means of a well-established dialectological methoda rapid anonymous survey[32] found a highly similar diffusion of /l/-vocalization in Swiss German to the one presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [32] examined 35 native dialect speakers on average (SD = 9) in each of 20 localities (i.e., nearly 700 subjects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They reported diffusion of this typically Bernese German phenomenon towards the west, south, and southeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That the two methods provide very similar results is illustrated in the scatterplot matrix shown in Fig 15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fig 15 shows a scatterplot of the degree of vocalization as captured by the crowdsourcing method (x-axis) and the degree of vocalization as captured by the traditional method (y-axis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Degree of vocalization means the percentage of vocalized /l/ tokens found in these localities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Adelboden (red x symbol in Fig 15), for example, the traditional method documented that 11% of speakers vocalized; in the crowdsourcing method, 7% of the speakers reported vocalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not all localities from the [32] study are represented in the Atlas (Baden and Interlaken), which is why the closest Atlas neighbor was taken as a reference point; for Baden this was Birmenstorf, and for Interlaken this was Unterseen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red line indicates the regression line, with the red area denoting the 95% confidence limits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of agreement scores scatter perfectly along the regression line (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hünenberg (green square symbol), Freienbach (yellow z symbol), and Zürich (bold print purple square)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These localities all indicate a low degree of vocalization in both methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other localities lie somewhat farther away from the regression line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spiez (blue + symbol), for example, shows a high degree of vocalization as captured by the traditional method, but a much lower degree in the crowdsourcing framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fribourg city (green dot symbol), too, shows a high degree of vocalization in the traditional method, but much less so in DÄ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We computed a correlation of the degree of vocalization as captured with the traditional method and the degree of vocalization as captured with the crowdsourcing method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation was significant (Pearsons correlation R(16) = -.77, p less_than.0001*), with a strong linear relation between the two variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a clear trend that the degree of vocalization captured by the two methods is related.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this evidence, it seems that the applied crowdsourcing method provides a valid and promising tool for documenting language change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly interesting given that /l/-vocalization is a phonetic variable, which for elicitation faces all the many limitations mentioned earlier for crowdsourcing perception data (see 4.5.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DÄ capitalizes on the Swiss public interest in dialectology by providing functionality that allows users to localize their own Swiss German dialect on the basis of a few words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We built a model with a set of maximally predictive words that were chosen from the historic Linguistic Atlas of German-speaking Switzerland, which documents the language situation of the mid-20th century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These words highlight the differences between dialect areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that we elicited the users dialect with the app, we were able to compare old Atlas dialect data to data from 2013/2014, allowing us to locate and document language change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that changes have taken place on all investigated linguistic levels: phonetic, lexical, and morphological.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results further show a trend that phonetic variables seem less vulnerable to change, while lexical and morphological variables diverge from the Atlas findings to a greater degree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report overlap in results of this crowdsourcing method with more traditional dialectological approaches, thus underlying the validity of using these new methods for studying language change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of smartphones for scientific experimentation potentially heralds a new era in linguistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DÄ architecture has recently been applied on different languages, including American English [66] and Austrian and German dialects of German [67].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apps for British English, Japanese, and French dialects are currently in development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
