New records of the dolphin Albertocetus meffordorum (Odontoceti: Xenorophidae) from the lower Oligocene of South Carolina: Encephalization, sensory anatomy, postcranial morphology, and ontogeny of early odontocetes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We report five new specimens of xenorophid dolphins from North and South Carolina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four of the specimens represent the xenorophid Albertocetus meffordorum, previously only known from the holotype skull.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other is a fragmentary petrosal from the upper Oligocene Belgrade Formation that we refer to Echovenator sp, indicating at least two xenorophids from that unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two of the Albertocetus meffordorum specimens are from the lower Oligocene Ashley Formation: 1) a partial skeleton with neurocranium, fragmentary mandible, ribs, vertebrae, and chevrons, and 2) an isolated braincase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The partial vertebral column indicates that Albertocetus retained the ancestral morphology and locomotory capabilities of basilosaurid archaeocetes, toothed mysticetes, and physeteroids, and caudal vertebrae that are as wide as tall suggest that the caudal peduncle, which occurs in all extant Cetacea, was either wide or lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CT data from the isolated braincase were used to generate a digital endocast of the cranial cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated EQ of this specimen is relatively high for an Oligocene odontocete, and other aspects of the brain, such as its anteroposterior length and relative size of the temporal lobe, are intermediate in morphology between those of extant cetaceans and terrestrial artiodactyls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethmoturbinals are also preserved, and are similar in morphology and number to those described for the Miocene odontocete Squalodon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fossils extend the temporal range of Albertocetus meffordorum into the early Oligocene, its geographic range into South Carolina, and expand our paleobiological understanding of the Xenorophidae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considerable progress has been made in recent years towards elucidating the early evolutionary history of toothed whales (Odontoceti).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A series of significant discoveries have revealed that the earliest odontocetes could echolocate [1], possessed inner ear adaptations for ultrasonic hearing [2, 3], and rapidly adapted specialized feeding strategies [4]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other recent advances have clarified morphological evolution, homology, and phylogeny of early odontocetes [510] and others have even referred important new material to taxa with missing holotypes [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like the study of early mysticetes, most studies of Oligocene odontocetes have focused on reporting new taxa based only on a single specimen and only a few have incorporated larger samples ([12]:2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xenorophid dolphins are the earliest diverging clade within Odontoceti, and demonstrate that echolocation, telescoping (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the posterior migration of the rostral bones and bony nares over the neurocranium), and ecological specialization rapidly evolved shortly after the extinction of the Basilosauridae [13]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All prior studies of the Xenorophidae have focused on crania or earbones because the holotypes and only known specimens lack (Xenorophus sloanii, Albertocetus meffordorum) or have scant (Cotylocara macei, Echovenator sandersi) postcranial material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study refers new specimens to Albertocetus meffordorum from the upper Oligocene Belgrade Formation and lower Oligocene Ashley Formation (Fig 1A and 1B), and for the first time, one of these specimens has associated postcrania with a cranium and petrotympanics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new material illuminates virtually unexplored aspects of early odontocete ontogeny and paleobiology including olfaction, encephalization, and locomotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The partial skeleton CCNHM 303 (Fig 1C) was mechanically prepared by an unknown student preparator; R.W.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boessenecker continued preparation of CCNHM 303 and removed the petrosal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cemented matrix on the petrosal of CCNHM 303 was removed by acid preparation in dilute (4%) acetic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCNHM 218 was collected under a South Carolina Hobby License issued by the Maritime Research Division (M. Havenstein, pers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  comm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4/2016).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photographs were taken with a Canon Rebel XS and 80mm zoom lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were recorded with digital calipers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Terminology for cranial osteology generally follows Mead and Fordyce [13] with some useful additions typically applied to mysticete petrotympanics [14, 15]; postcranial osteological terms after [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Albertocetus meffordorum endocast was segmented using the software Amira for Life Sciences (version 5.4.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single endocast segment was created using the magic wand and lasso tools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cranial cavity was filled with matrix and at times the density of the matrix and bone were similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases matrix and bone were differentiated by adjusting the contrast gradient and observing the specimen in multiple planes (XY, YZ, and XZ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finished endocast was smoothed by using the simplifier button under the SurfaceGen module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of faces were decreased by 30% (initial: 18,000 faces; final: 12,600 faces).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Final images were taken using snapshot button while rotating the endocast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SurfaceGen feature in Amira was used to generate an isosurface on the Albertocetus endocast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smoothening of the endocast was left unconstrained to ensure a more accurate final value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the SurfaceArea option was applied to calculate the surface area and volume of the specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The endocranial volumes for Albertocetus and other fossil specimens were reduced based on an estimate of non-neural tissue (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  meninges, vasculature) within the endocast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make this estimate we took data on brain mass and brain adnexia in cetaceans from a previous study [17], converted this to volumes using their value of specific gravity for brain tissue of 1.04, log normalized both series, and then calculated a linear regression in the application PAST [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These equations allowed us to estimate what fraction of the digital endocast was occupied by the brain and what portion was occupied by adnexia in fossil taxa, specifically those taxa and specimens included in a previous study [19] (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One group of extinct cetaceans, the basilosaurids, have an extensive vascular rete that is very visible on an endocast [20, 21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The above method, which is based on extant taxa, does not account for this morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus for basilosaurids we used published estimates for the volumes of retia that were derived form detailed study of individual endocasts [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally we also used this opportunity to update the brain mass estimates for several extant odontocetes in a previous dataset [19] with those from a recent comprehensive study [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Body mass was calculated using the following equation from a previous study [19] that relates mass (in grams) to width across the occipital condyles (OCW in mm):  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mass = 1000 x 10((3.814 x log (OCW))  5.345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to assess the robustness of our body mass estimate we also calculated the body mass of Albertocetus and other Oligocene fossil odontocetes using two other equations derived from linear regressions of measurements obtained from extant taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is an equation that estimates total body length (cm) from the bizygomatic width (BIZYG) of the skull in cm [22]: log(total body length) = 0.92 * (log(BIZYG)  1.72) + 2.68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was then entered into a separate equation that relates body mass to body length [23]: body mass (kg) = 10 (2.799*(total body length in cm) - 4.464).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Taphonomic_note  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vertebrae LD, LE, and the more completely preserved chevron preserve several bone modifications (Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two types are present: 1) 1030 mm long linear, arcuate grooves incised into the bone surface (present on the chevron and right transverse process of LE) and 2) a series of short, shallow subparallel scratch marks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These likely represent tooth marks from scavenging sharks (1) and fish, rays, or skates (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type 1 correspond most closely to the ichnotaxon Linichnus but differ from Linichnus serratus in having smooth (rather than serrated) margins [48]; this may prompt the description of a new ichnotaxon for smooth-edged Linichnus traces, typically inferred to reflect the tips of shark teeth scraping into bone [49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type 2 resemble the short, parallel scratches made by feeding skates (Rajidae) during actualistic feeding experiments [50]; similar traces have been reported on he holotype specimen of the Oligocene baleen whale Waharoa ruwhenua [51].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Encephalization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The finished endocast was shown to have a volume of 478.797cc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If brain density is assumed to be 1.04 g/cc [17], then this would yield a brain mass of 460.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the digitally rendered endocast closely resembles an isolated brain, endocasts also contain circulatory structures and meninges, even if these structures are not particularly visible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in the methods we estimated the volume of adnexia by calculating a linear regression of log(adnexia volume) and log(total endocranial volume) based on data from a recent study [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting regression had a r2 of 0.84616 and is described as follows: log (adnexia volume in cc) = 1.7698*log(endocranial volume in cc) - 3.4931.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When applied to all fossil odontocetes in the Marino et al dataset [19], it indicates that the estimated brain masses of these extinct taxa should be reduced from 2.1 to 19.6%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Albertocetus, the corrected brain mass would be 443.3 g. The body mass of Albertocetus, as inferred by breadth across the occipital condyles [19], is estimated to be 51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 kg, which yields an EQ67 of 2.586.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EQ for all other fossil taxa in the Marino et al dataset [19] were recalculated based on these reduced brain masses, but in general this did not affect the overall pattern of change in odontocete encephalization in the fossil record (Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also assessed how alternate estimates for body mass might affect the EQ of Oligocene odontocetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The width across the bizygomatic processes indicates a total length for Albertocetus of 1.82 m and a mass of 72.9 kg, about 71% larger than that estimated from breadth across occipital condyles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar discrepancies occur for three other Oligocene odontocetes for which we have bizygomatic width data for, whereas alternative body mass estimates for larger specimens are fairly similar (S1 Table).These higher body masses lead predictably to lower EQ67 values for some Oligocene odontocetes (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Xenorophids_from_the_Oligocene_of_North_Carolina  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The holotype specimen of Albertocetus meffordorum (USNM 525001) was collected ex situ within a limestone concretion found on Onslow Beach, North Carolina, and presumed to originate from offshore deposits of the upper Oligocene Belgrade Formation [3, 10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An isolated incomplete, waterworn petrosal (USNM 534010; Fig 8E and 8F) from the same locality was studied by Park et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3], who identified the specimen as a xenorophid but were unable to identify any synapomorphies permitting identification as A. meffordorum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of a new specimen of Albertocetus with a complete petrosal removed from the cranium (CCNHM 303; Fig 7) and additional petrosals (CCNHM 1188, USNM 559392; Fig 8C, 8D, 8G and 8H) from the Belgrade Formation at Belgrade Quarry, North Carolina, invites comparison with the specimen (USNM 534010) reported by Park et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though incomplete, the anterior process of USNM 534010 appears to have been hatchet-shaped with a dorsally concave superior process, like A. meffordorum, Echovenator sandersi, and Cotylocara macei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, USNM 534010 differs from A. meffordorum and C. macei in having a broad, shallow suprameatal fossa (Fig 8B, 8D, 8F and 8H) with indistinct margins, and that is anteroposteriorly more elongate than the pars cochlearis, contrasting with the relatively small and deeply excavated pit seen in Albertocetus meffordorum, Cotylocara macei, and Xenorophus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A broad suprameatal fossa is a plesiomorphic feature characterizing basilosaurid archaeocetes [45] and some archaic mysticetes including eomysticetids [14] and aetiocetids (Fucaia buelli; [44]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the superior process of USNM 534010 is transversely sharp in comparison to the bulbous ridge in A. meffordorum and other xenorophids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second petrosal (CCNHM 1188; Fig 8G and 8H) matching the morphology of USNM 534010 (Fig 8E and 8F) and representing the same taxon was recently collected by one of us (RWB) from the Belgrade Formation at the Martin Marietta Aggregates Quarry (colloquially referred to as Belgrade Quarry) in Jones County, North Carolina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features preclude identification of USNM 534010 and CCNHM 1188 to A. meffordorum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  USNM 534010 and CCNHM 1188 share with Echovenator a shallow and anteroposteriorly elongate suprameatal fossa lacking distinct margins, a transversely narrow facial canal, and a posterior bullar facet with an acutely triangular margin (missing in CCNHM 1188).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to these features, USNM 534010 and CCNHM 1188 are identifiable as Echovenator sp., and in concert with other specimens reported herein, indicate the presence of two xenorophids in the Belgrade Formation of North Carolina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that many additional xenorophids have yet to be named from the Ashley and Chandler Bridge formations of South Carolina (CCNHM 171; ChM PV 2758; Xenorophus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; ChM PV 4746; [1]: Fig 3), it would not be surprising if additional species of xenorophids (and other cetaceans) are discovered from the Belgrade Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Brain_size_and_EQ_in_early_Odontoceti  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An EQ value of 2.586 in Albertocetus is within the range of Oligocene odontocetes reported by [19], but a more careful review of their data indicates this is on the high end of EQ expected for a taxon of its age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marino et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [19] included seven Paleogene odontocetes in their study, five were assigned to the Chattian (27.0 Ma), one to the Rupelian (33.0 Ma), and one to the late Eocene (38.0 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the USNM collections database, one of the Chattian specimens (USNM 256604) and the late Eocene specimen (USNM 205491) were collected from the Toledo Formation, better known as the Rupelian Alsea Formation [52]; furthermore, one of these specimens, USNM 256604, is actually a small aetiocetid mysticete close in braincase and petrosal morphology to Fucaia buelli ([44]; Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these more refined ages, Albertocetus is the most encephalized of Rupelian odontocetes for which endocast volumes are available (EQ = 1.2172.586) and near the higher end of values reported for Chattian odontocetes (EQ = 1.2342.966; Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically its EQ is exceeded by an unnamed species of Xenorophus (ChM PV4266, EQ = 2.966) and another specimen of uncertain affinities (USNM 335502, EQ = 2.718).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar finding occurs if we compare the EQ values inferred based on model based methods in a phylogenetic context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Montgomery et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [53] calculated that the node connecting Xenorophus to a clade that includes all extant odontocetes had an EQ of 1.6804.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus on the branch leading to Xenorophus there was an inferred change in EQ from 1.6804 to 3.2759.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A value of 2.586 for Albertocetus, a member of the Xenorophidae, is consistent with this inferred evolutionary change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One unexpected finding is the difference we found in EQ when using an alternative measures of body mass; specifically bizygomatic width and inferred body length [22, 23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the Oligocene odontocetes for which we have bizygomatic width measured data (either collected by the first author or from a previous study [4]), body size estimated this way are, on average, 136% larger than when estimated using breadth across the occipital condyles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancy itself seems correlated with size; the bizygomatic widths of the two largest skulls (ChM PV2761, PV2757) actually provide slightly smaller body size estimates (9091%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently we do not have enough measurements to address the significance of these observations, but it is consistent with a previous study that found that occipital condyle breadth typically underestimated body length [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If bizygomatic width is a more accurate measure of body mass for Oligocene odontocetes, then the pronounced decreases in body size along the odontocete stem discovered by a previous study [53] could be an artifact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly additional work is needed to improve the accuracy of body size estimate for extinct cetaceans, but that issue is outside of the scope of the current study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ontogeny_in_Xenorophidae  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ontogenetic studies of extinct cetaceans are rare as they require samples including multiple referred specimens of different ontogenetic stageswhereas many studies emphasizing new taxa and phylogenetic insights have focused on taxa based on single individuals ([12] and references therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some studies of extinct mysticetes have examined ontogenetic and intraspecific variation, albeit with small sample sizes [12, 54, 55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Few comparable studies for extinct Odontoceti exist (but see [56] and [57]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The known sample of Albertocetus meffordorum is small (n = 3 specimens with crania), yet informative for the earliest diverging odontocetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CCNHM 218 and CCNHM 303 represent different ontogenetic stages owing to a number of differences in cranial suture closure and size of muscle attachment crests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCNHM 303 differs from 218 in retaining an open parieto-occipital suture and an incompletely closed median frontal suture; these sutures are completely closed in CCNHM 218 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible remnant of interparietal in CCNHM 303 (Fig 2A)absent in 218further suggests younger ontogenetic status, though partial fusion is suggestive of sexual maturity at minimum [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, CCNHM 303 has cranial crests that are smaller and less prominent than CCNHM 218 (Figs 24), including dorsoventrally shallower nuchal crests, anteroposteriorly shorter basioccipital crests, and an anteroposteriorly narrower paroccipital process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Juvenile status of CCNHM 303 is unlikely owing to completely closed intra-occipital sutures [58, 59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain cranial sutures remaining only partially closed in CCNHM 218 (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  frontoparietal suture) similarly remain incompletely fused in mature extant odontocetes [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suture closure thus suggests subadult status for CCNHM 303 and adult status for CCNHM 218.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite these various cranial features suggesting a younger ontogenetic status for CCNHM 303, nearly all postcranial vertebrae bear completely fused epiphyses (Figs 1013), with one exception: the anterior epiphysis of C5; similarly, the posterior epiphysis of C5 and both epiphyses of C6 are partially fused.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In modern cetaceans, epiphyseal fusion commences anteriorly and posteriorly within the cervical and caudal series and proceeds towards the middle of the column (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  thoracics, lumbars), whereas in terrestrial mammals the posterior ossification center is further anterior, within or adjacent to the sacrum [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Judging from CCNHM 303, epiphyseal fusion of the posterior cervicals appears to have occurred last in Albertocetus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Odontocetes for which published epiphyseal fusion data are available typically lack independent ontogenetic age determinations (but see [61]), but complete fusion in Balaena mysticetus and terrestrial mammals does not occur until after sexual maturity [60], perhaps consistent with the skeletally mature vertebral column and skeletally immature cranium of CCNHM 303.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future osteological studies should supplement the work of Moran et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [60] by recording postcranial epiphyseal fusion as well as scoring cranial suture closure (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [58, 59]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A final point is that these two specimens originate from different members of the Ashley Formation (CCNHM 303, Givhans Ferry Member; CCNHM 218, Runnymede Marl Member), though these two units are of nearly the same age according to 87Sr/86Sr dates [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Locomotion_in_early_Odontoceti  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies of locomotor evolution in Cetacea have generally focused on the land-to-sea transition, as superbly documented by archaeocete skeletons from Indo-Pakistan, Egypt, and the southeastern United States [16, 6267].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps owing to the relatively modernized postcranial skeletons of most Neogene cetaceans and the dearth of described Oligocene cetaceans with postcrania [12, 14], most studies of locomotor evolution have compared and contrasted various archaeocete grades with modern cetaceans ([16, 68, 69]; but see [70]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Basilosaurid archaeocetes were the earliest whales restricted to a marine life, though they retained external hindlimbs decoupled from the vertebral column [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posterior thoracic, lumbar, and caudal vertebrae of basilosaurids, all modern and extinct baleen whales, and sperm whales (Kogia, Physeter) are proportionally similar, permitting dorsoventral undulation along most of the column (= pattern 1 of [70]); these vertebrae are functionally differentiated in all other Odontoceti, with anteroposterior foreshortening of vertebrae stiffening the thoracolumbar series only (= pattern 2 of [70]) or throughout the posterior thoracic, lumbar, and caudal series (= pattern 3 of [70]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertebral stiffening serves to limit the amplitude of undulation and enhance swimming speed [70], with extremely foreshortened vertebrae characterizing rapidly swimming delphinids and phocoenids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rectangular, dorsoventrally shallow terminal caudal vertebrae are osteological correlates of large triangular caudal flukes in modern cetaceans; similarly shaped caudals in basilosaurid whales indicate that flukes are common to all Pelagiceti [16, 70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In modern cetaceans, the tail immediately anterior to the flukes consists of a streamlined caudal peduncle that is dorsoventrally deep and transversely narrow; extreme narrowness of the body is expressed in anterior and mid-caudal vertebrae that are transversely narrower than they are dorsoventrally deep [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly all extant odontocetes (except Physeter and Kogia) further express anteroposteriorly foreshortened anterior caudal vertebrae, serving to stiffen the peduncle (Patterns 2 and 3 of [70]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike extant cetaceans, the basilosaurid Dorudon atrox lacked transversely narrowed anterior caudal vertebrae (Fig 17), suggesting that it lacked a narrowed caudal peduncle [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus if only extant taxa are considered, it is most parsimonious to infer that a transversely narrow caudal peduncle is a synapomorphy of Neoceti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The referred skeleton of Albertocetus meffordorum (CCNHM 303) possesses the first postcranial skeleton for a xenorophid dolphin (Fig 1C), the earliest diverging clade within Odontoceti [1, 2, 11, 37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unsurprisingly, terminal caudal vertebrae (CE and CF) are rectangular and dorsoventrally shallow, indicating the presence of caudal flukes as in all other Pelagiceti (Basilosauridae + Neoceti).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posterior thoracic, lumbar, and anterior caudal vertebrae of CCNHM 303 are all proportionally similar and gradually become longer towards the anterior caudals (Fig 16), paralleling the basilosaurid Zygorhiza kochii, the toothed mysticete Aetiocetus cotylalveus, extant mysticetes, and sperm whales (Buchholtz [70]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of foreshortening in the anterior caudal vertebrae, and proportional similarity of other 'torso' vertebrae (Fig 17) indicates that Albertocetus meffordorum conforms to Pattern 1 of Buchholtz [70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is unsurprising, as the early diverging phylogenetic position of Physeter and Kogia within extant Odontoceti [37] strongly suggests that the Pattern 1 vertebral morphology is the primitive condition amongst Neoceti and stem Odontoceti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertebral morphology in Albertocetus meffordorum is consistent with mysticete and sperm whale-like locomotion where dorsoventral undulation occurs throughout a flexible vertebral column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that Albertocetus was likely a slower and less efficient swimmer than odontocetes within the clade Synrhina (Delphinoidea + "river dolphins" + Ziphiidae; [37]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Morphology of the remaining caudal vertebrae is unexpected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mid-caudal vertebral centra (Ca B, Ca C, Ca D) are nearly equidimensional in shape and lack the transversely narrow profile of modern cetaceans with a caudal peduncle (Figs 11, 12 and 16), and are instead proportionally similar to basilosaurid caudal vertebrae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the caudal series of CCNHM 303 is incomplete, this suggests that Albertocetus meffordorumand likely other early diverging odontocetesprimitively lacked a transversely narrow caudal peduncle, similar to the basilosaurid Dorudon atrox [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The caudal vertebrae of the toothed mysticete Aetiocetus cotylalveus are similarly equidimensional ([70]: Fig 7C) possibly indicating the absence of a narrow caudal peduncle, although the distal end of the tail is not represented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, this data implies that the caudal peduncle evolved independently within Odontoceti and Mysticeti, further highlighting the plasticity of the vertebral skeleton within Cetacea [70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One caveat to the above suggestion is that only part of the axial skeleton of Albertocetus meffordorum is represented, and we can not rule out the presence of a short series of unpreserved vertebrae between Ca D and Ca E that were transversely compressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus additional specimens of archaic Neoceti with even more complete axial skeletons are needed to test our novel hypothesis that a transversely compressed caudal peduncle evolved twice, once in Odontoceti and again in Mysticeti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New odontocete specimens from the lower Oligocene Ashley Formation of South Carolina include an isolated cranium and a partial skeleton including incomplete cranium with petrotympanics and fragmentary mandible, cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and caudal vertebrae, ribs, and a chevron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These specimens extend the range of Albertocetus meffordorum into the early Oligocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well-preserved petrosals permit more refined identification of a recently reported petrosal from the upper Oligocene Belgrade Formation of North Carolina as Echovenator sp., and permit referral of two additional Belgrade Formation petrosals to Albertocetus meffordorum and Echovenator sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future collecting efforts in North Carolina are expected to yield other cetaceans conspecific with those from the contemporaneous Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endocast of Albertocetus meffordorum is intermediate in morphology between extant odontocetes and archaeocete whales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endocast volume indicates that Albertocetus meffordorum is the most highly encephalized odontocete from the early Oligocene (EQ = 2.586), well within the range of extant delphinoids, and chronicling a drastic jump in EQ across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further study of appropriate body size estimation is needed to investigate the proposed Eocene-Oligocene explosion in odontocete encephalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample size of Albertocetus meffordorum permits the first basic examination of ontogenetic trends in stem Odontoceti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ontogenetic study of Albertocetus meffordorum identifies several sutures of the dorsal braincase and facial region of interest for assessing ontogenetic status in stem Odontoceti (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  median parietal suture, frontoparietal suture, frontonasal suture, parieto-occipital suture), to be confirmed with larger samples of undescribed xenorophids (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Echovenator, Xenorophus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postcranial epiphyseal fusion is achieved earlier in ontogeny than cranial suture closure in A. meffordorum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertebral proportions indicate that Albertocetus meffordorum, like basilosaurids, Mysticeti, and sperm whales, is a "pattern 1" species with no anteroposterior specialization of the vertebral column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that dorsoventral undulation occurred through the entire flexible lumbocaudal series; this appears to characterize stem odontocetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rectangular caudal vertebrae indicate the presence of caudal flukes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, no caudal vertebrae are transversely narrower than tall, suggesting the absence of a transversely narrowed peduncle as in all extant Mysticeti and Odontoceti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a feature would imply that the narrow peduncle evolved independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, skeletons of stem odontocetes and mysticetes with a more complete caudal series are required to further evaluate this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
