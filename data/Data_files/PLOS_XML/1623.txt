Conformational risk factors of brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) in pugs, French bulldogs, and bulldogs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extremely brachycephalic, or short-muzzled, dog breeds such as pugs, French bulldogs, and bulldogs are prone to the conformation-related respiratory disorderbrachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Affected dogs present with a wide range of clinical signs from snoring and exercise intolerance, to life-threatening events such as syncope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, conformational risk factors for BOAS that could potentially aid in breeding away from BOAS were sought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six hundred and four pugs, French bulldogs, and bulldogs were included in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soft tape measurements of the head and body were used and the inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breed-specific models were developed to assess the associations between the conformational factors and BOAS status based on functional grading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The models were further validated by means of a BOAS index, which is an objective measurement of respiratory function using whole-body barometric plethysmography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final models have good predictive power for discriminating BOAS (-) and BOAS (+) phenotypes indicated by the area under the curve values of  greater than 80% on the receiver operating curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When other factors were controlled, stenotic nostrils were associated with BOAS in all three breeds; pugs and bulldogs with higher body condition scores (BCS) had a higher risk of developing BOAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the standardized conformational measurements (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  craniofacial ratio (CFR), eye width ratio (EWR), skull index (SI), neck girth ratio (NGR), and neck length ratio (NLR)), for pugs EWR and SI, for French bulldogs NGR and NLR, and for bulldogs SI and NGR showed significant associations with BOAS status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the NGR in bulldogs was the only significant predictor that also had satisfactory inter-observer reproducibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A NGR higher than 0.71 in male bulldogs was predictive of BOAS with approximately 70% sensitivity and specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, stenotic nostrils, BCS, and NGR were found to be valid, easily applicable predictors for BOAS (+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) is a conformation-related respiratory disorder of dog breeds with shortened skulls and muzzles, such as the pug, the French bulldog, the bulldog, and others [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breeding selection for extreme brachycephalia has resulted in deformation of the upper airway tract leading to obstruction, as the soft tissues have not reduced proportionately with the length of the skull [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Affected dogs show noisy and laboured breathing with exercise and heat intolerance, often accompanied by sleep disturbed breathing, gastrointestinal disorders such as regurgitation and vomiting, and in the worst cases, cyanosis, collapse and death [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although clinical signs of BOAS can, at an individual level, be improved by surgery, severely affected dogs are at a higher anaesthetic risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, for dogs that have developed secondary lesions such as collapse of the laryngeal cartilages (Grade II-III laryngeal collapse), the prognosis may be guarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BOAS is a serious welfare issue [7, 8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average lifespan of brachycephalic breeds is reduced by approximately three years when compared to that of mesaticephalic and dolichocephalic breeds of similar body size [912], with much of this difference likely due to BOAS and its syndromic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The problems caused by BOAS have been compounded by the increased popularity of the three extreme brachycephalic breeds named above over the last two decades in the UK and elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the drivers that may have caused the increasing numbers of these dogs, such as celebrity endorsement and widespread adoption by advertisers, remain in place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three breeds are now amongst the top ten breeds in popularity in the UK [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the past century, the skull shape in the extreme brachycephalic breeds has gradually decreased in facial length and increased in skull width proportionally [14], and it has often been suggested that this is associated with an increase in both severity and prevalence of BOAS [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous study, we found that approximately 50% of our study dogs in the three extreme brachycephalic breeds were BOAS-affected according to whole-body barometric plethysmography (WBBP), an objective respiratory function test [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others have shown that during a two-year period in the UK, about 20% of pugs have respiratory disease at a level which triggers a veterinary consultation [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that an estimated 60% of owners do not recognise the clinical signs of BOAS [18, 19], the true prevalence may be much higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is also true that the high-risk breeds include elderly dogs that have normal respiratory traces and have not suffered from BOAS during their lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, there has been a growing awareness of BOAS-related welfare issues amongst dog owners and other stakeholders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that reformation of the breed standards of brachycephalic breeds could reduce the prevalence of BOAS in extreme brachycephalic breeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have identified and quantified the causal anatomical lesions along the upper airway using advanced diagnostic images such as computed tomography (CT) and endoscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative measurements were described in order to look for potential biomarkers for BOAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include the length and thickness of the soft palate [20], the tracheal diameter [21], nasopharyngeal dimension [22], glottis dimension [23], and mucosal contact points of the nasal turbinates [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these measurements required sedation or general anaesthesia, which is impractical for screening the pet populationparticularly in dogs that have no clinical signs of BOAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, soft tape measurements have been proposed to quantify morphology in dogs [25] and were further applied to study BOAS [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Packer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2015) study reported that craniofacial ratio (CFR) and neck girth are conformation-related risk factors for BOAS when comparing data across breeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These measurements are non-invasive and easily accessible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The practical implications of these measurements in specific breeds is still uncertain, and their reproducibility is also uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence there is an urgent need for anatomical or conformational markers that can allow breeders of these short-faced dogs to select away from BOAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The objective of this study was to identify breed specific external conformational characteristics that are associated with BOAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soft tape measurements were used to quantify conformational features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inter-observer reproducibility of the measurements was examined to see whether these measurements could form a secure basis for breeder decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conformational measurements and other potential factors such as body condition score (BCS) were then compared with BOAS Functional Grade (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  clinical assessment of respiratory signs before and after an exercise tolerance test) and the associations were further validated using the BOAS index (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  objective score of respiratory obstruction measured from WBBP parameters) developed using breed-specific computational models (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_&_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Six hundreds and four dogs (189 pugs, 214 French bulldogs, 201 bulldogs) were included in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subjects were either: referred for BOAS consultation at the Queens Veterinary School Hospital (QVSH), University of Cambridge; were pet dogs volunteered by UK owners and breeders; were show dogs exhibited at regional dog shows between September 2013 and September 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dogs were excluded if: they were aged less_than1 year of age as they were considered immature in head and body dimension; they had had previous upper airway surgery; they had history/clinical findings of lower airway disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dogs that were on medications that may change respiration (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  prednisolone and anti-inflammatory drugs) were also excluded from the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed history of each dog was taken from owners including type, severity, frequency and circumstances of occurrence of respiratory signs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Work was performed under informed ethical consents CR62 and CR63 from the Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Respiratory_grading_and_BOAS_Index  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All participating dogs were graded for functional severity of BOAS using a previously established four-point functional grading system based on clinical evaluation before and after an exercise tolerance test [16, 19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BOAS functional Grade 0 dogs (asymptomatic, BOAS free) and Grade I dogs (mild BOAS, the dog shows mild respiratory noise but exercise tolerance is unaffected) were considered not to have clinically significant BOAS, namely BOAS (-) in this study; Grade II dogs (moderate BOAS, the dog requires medical attention such as weight control and/or surgical intervention) and Grade III dogs (severe BOAS, the dog requires immediate surgical intervention) were considered clinically affected, namely BOAS (+) in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The BOAS index (a numeric scale of 0100%, with 0% being entirely asymptomatic and 100% being the most severe status of BOAS), derived from previously established breed-specific computational models [16] using quadratic discriminant analysis, computed from WBBP waveforms of some participating dogs, was used to validate the risk predictive models (for details see the section statistical analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not all participants had available WBBP data due to an insufficient testing period, a distracting testing environment, and/or test intolerance of the animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed protocols of the WBBP test were reported previously [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conformational_classifications_and_measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For all dogs, a body weight measurement, and a standard assessment of the body fat, the body condition score (BCS) on a 19 point scale [27], was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of nostril stenosis was examined and classified using a previously established grading system [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Open or mild stenosis was considered acceptable for these breeds, and moderate or severe stenosis was defined as stenotic nostrils in this study [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of the nostril grading for each breed are shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nine measurements of the skull and body of each dog were taken using a standard one-meter soft tape measure (millimeter scales): skull length (SL), cranial length (CL), snout length (SnL), skull width (SW), eye width (EW), neck length (NL), neck girth (NG), chest girth (CG), and body length (BL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The definitions of each measurement are listed in Table 1, while Fig 2 illustrates the method of measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these measurements were described previously [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SL and SW were used to estimate the skull index, which was used as an indicator of different skull shapes: brachycephalic, mesaticephalic, or dolichocephalic [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inter-observer_reproducibility_of_the_conformational_soft_tape_measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inter-observer reproducibility of each measurement was tested for each breed separately due to their different facial and body conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sixty dogs (20 dogs for each breed) were included in the inter-observer reproducibility test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bulldogs were from a single dog show, while the pugs and French bulldogs were from volunteered dogs and referral dogs measured at the QVSH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each dog, soft tape measurements were repeated by two investigators who had been trained to perform the measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We randomly combine the two observers from a group of four investigators to avoid the inclusion of systematic errors and better model a potential pair of breeders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All Statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.3.0 for Mac, https://www.r-project.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significance level was set at 0.05 in all tests, unless otherwise indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparisons of numeric variables between breeds were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc test for pairwise comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square tests, followed by multiple pairwise comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bonferroni corrections were used in each case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Due to facial and body differences between breeds, all of the following analyses were completed within each breed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subjects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Details of the signalment are shown in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pugs had significantly higher BCS (median BCS = 7) than French bulldogs (median BCS = 5, pless_than0.0001) and bulldogs (median, BCS = 6, pless_than0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant difference in gender distribution between breeds (p = 0.736).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bulldog group had a significantly lower proportion of dogs that were neutered when compared to the pug (2 = 40.41, pless_than0.0001) and the French bulldog groups (2 = 32.12, pless_than0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of the degree of nostril stenosis was significantly different between the three breeds (2 = 43.28, pless_than0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  75.4% of French bulldogs had moderately to severely stenotic nostrils, while prevalence amongst pugs (65.3%) and bulldogs (44.2%) was lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of BOAS (+) pugs (64.6%) was higher than the French bulldog (58.9%) and the bulldog (51.2%) groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the distribution of the BOAS functional grades did not differ significantly between breeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As all analyses were carried out for each individual breed, results are presented separately for each breed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study describes breed-specific models using several conformational factors to predict the probability of being BOAS-affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large sample size in the study supports that each ratio is reliable in population terms, and could guide the writing of breed standards, although the likelihood of inaccuracy in many of the individual measurement as shown by ICC and eME means that most of the individual limits cannot be set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reliable measures, such as the NGR in bulldogs, and other easily accessible factors, such as nostril stenosis and BCS, may be of use for breeding selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inter-observer_agreement_of_conformational_soft_tape_measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sutter et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2008) reported that approximately 0.13% of soft tape measurements used in a multi-breed study were judged to be measurement errors, yet the actual inter-observer agreement of the measurements was not tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither did the Packer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2015) study investigating the conformational risk factors for BOAS describe measurement inter-observer agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, most of the conformational soft tape measurements in the present study had poor inter-observer agreement in all three breeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors have found that performing tape measurements may be challenging on unsedated dogs, as measurements can be altered easily with slight changes in position (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  small changes in degree of the angle between the neck and the back or in head carriage when standing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In dogs with loose and thick skin and/or thick fat coverage it is particularly difficult to reproduce the measurements with good accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, some of the dogs objected to facial measurements such as SnL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements mentioned above showed large errors of up to 18.7% between two different trained observers and had poor inter-observer agreement according to ICC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These measurement errors directly affect the inter-observer agreement of the respective ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inter-observer reproducibility of the CFR was worst in French bulldogs with the mean measurement errors over 22%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  French bulldogs have highly variable over-nose skin fold patterns that affect this measure, whereas in the other two breeds, the type of fold was more uniform (a single fold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among all the ratios, only CFR in pugs and NGR in bulldogs had reasonably good inter-observer agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Breed-specific_predictors_for_brachycephalic_obstructive_airway_syndrome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In pugs, female dogs have a higher risk of developing BOAS than male dogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in French bulldogs, the trend was the opposite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While male dogs are often used as stud dogs at an early age, postponing the decision to breed until the dog is older is recommended, as affected dogs may only show clinical signs in adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stenotic nostrils were a significant predictor for BOAS in all three breeds, consistent with our previous findings [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stenosis of the nostrils is the only BOAS airway lesion that can be easily diagnosed without sedation and/or specific equipment, such as an endoscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grading system proposed by the authors is straightforward and easily applicable by dog owners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, nostril stenosis may play a significant role in the severity of BOAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nasal breathing is predominant in dogs, even when the dog is panting, the majority of airflow passes through the nasal cavity during inspiration [34, 35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Commonly, dogs with moderately/severely stenotic nostrils have immobile nostril wings during exercise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas dogs with open/mildly stenotic nostrils usually have mobile nostril wings that can abduct further when needed [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the restriction of airflow at the entrance of the airway, dogs with stenotic nostrils can be prone to poor thermal regulation and may have an excessive increase in negative pressure within the airway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stenotic nostrils are a particular issue in French bulldogs, in the present study, 45% of French bulldogs had severe stenosis of the nostrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the impact of stenotic nostrils on BOAS is substantial, the responsible breeder should avoid using dogs with moderate/severe stenotic nostrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Obesity, as quantified using BCS, was a robust risk factor for BOAS, and this result is consistent with previous studies [16, 26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of obesity on respiratory function includes a decrease in minute volume with an increase in respiratory rate, exercise intolerance, and a decrease in estimated arterial oxygen saturation [16, 36, 37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, while BCS was a significant risk factor for BOAS in pugs and bulldogs, this was not the case in French bulldogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 8.4% of French bulldogs were obese compared to 60.8% and 35.3% of pugs and bulldogs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 15% of Grade III French bulldogs were underweight and all of these had frequent regurgitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the possible anatomical abnormalities (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oesophageal diverticula), the increase in thoracic negative pressure during respiratory distress could further trigger gastrointestinal signs such as regurgitation and vomiting as a result of gastro-oesophageal reflux and temporary hiatal hernia [38, 39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the impact of obesity on BOAS in French bulldogs should not be ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was noted that the majority of the obese French bulldogs were BOAS (+) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BOAS, in many ways, is similar to human obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) [4043].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of obesity on OSA has been investigated with different measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, body mass index (BMI) z-score and neck-to-waist ratio were recognized as independent predictors of OSA [44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar findings were shown in the current study for French bulldogs and bulldogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Packer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2015) have previously reported that a greater neck girth increased the risk of BOAS, but the NG to CG ratio was not significantly associated with BOAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, both the absolute measurement of NG and NGR were significantly higher in BOAS (+) French bulldogs and bulldogs (S3 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason why NG and other direct measurements were not included in the initial models was that the measurements are significantly affected by body size and gender.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although gender was included in all models, the variation in size within the same gender should not be ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the CG was comparable between the BOAS (-) and BOAS (+) dogs, it could be used as a reference to normalize NG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neck fat accumulation is associated with severity of OSA in humans, and could cause a reduction in pharyngeal lumen diameter, further triggering collapse of the airway [4549].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike pugs and bulldogs, French bulldogs in our study tended to have an ideal BCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High NGR in slim dogs could be caused by either fat or muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actual relationship between the NGR and the impact on upper airway obstruction is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, NGR is a strong and valid predictor of BOAS independently of other factors in bulldogs and it may be assumed that selection away from this phenotype will reduce the prevalence of BOAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In French bulldogs, it was unexpected that the inter-observer agreement of NGR was poor when the measures of NG and CG were both reasonably reproducible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was found that in some dogs, the observer-1 measured the NG longer but CG shorter than observer-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the differences were not considerable for both of the measurements, the accumulated errors have a significant impact on NGR measurement inter-observer agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Other conformational factors such as SI and EWR in pugs, and NLR in French bulldogs were significantly associated with BOAS in the final models, after adjusting for other factors such as gender.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, not only did these measurements have poor inter-observer agreement, they were also not significantly associated or only marginally associated with the BOAS index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the measurements may not be valid for predicting individual BOAS-affected dogs at this stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is possible, that by introducing more reliable measurement methods these factors may be used as valid predictors for BOAS (+) in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

A previous study suggested that BOAS risk increases in dogs with relatively shorter muzzles (craniofacial ratio, CFR) and thicker necks, across different brachycephalic breeds: from extreme brachycephalic breeds such as the pug (median CFR = 0.08) to moderate brachycephalic breeds such as the Staffordshire Bull Terrier (median CFR = 0.5) [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study with large numbers of dogs of the three breeds, we obtained supportive data on NGR, but only a weak association of BOAS status with CFR in a single breed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within breeds, the variations in CFR were very limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CFR overlapped considerably between the different BOAS functional grades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings on the reproducibility of these measures and the large differences in detailed conformation between brachycephalic dog breeds suggest that the true associations between CFR and BOAS for specific breeds may not be comparable to the findings in the Packer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2015) study that compared multiple breeds with, in most cases, relatively small numbers of dogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anatomically, the CFR measurement cannot determine the main internal BOAS lesions along the upper airway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 7 illustrates the position at which CFR measurements are made, in comparison to the position of the internal lesions of BOAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For extreme brachycephalic dogs, the SnL only includes the region of the nasal planum and nasal vestibule, while other common BOAS lesions such as overcrowded and aberrant nasal turbinates, elongated soft palate, and macroglossia underlie the CL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore it is questionable that having higher CFR would effectively decrease the risk of BOAS for all individuals in the current population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, airway crowding will occur both for individuals with a short facial length and for individuals with a short cranium, so that the most severely affected CFR is not predictable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In dogs that had CFR higher than the third upper-quartile (CFR  greater than  0.19), 46% were still BOAS (+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to this result, it is more encouraging that among the dogs that had open/mildly stenotic nostrils, only 25% of them were BOAS (+) whereas among the dogs that had moderately/severely stenotic nostrils, 70% of them were BOAS (+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When considering a more effective criterion to assist in breeding away from BOAS, it is likely that the nostril grading would be superior to CFR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Limitations_of_the_study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are several limitations to this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firstly, only about half of the study population had an available BOAS index, which markedly reduces the power to validate the final model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, the study was conducted over three years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It might be possible that the investigators gradually gained more experience on measuring the dogs over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted though that the reproducibility measurements were performed towards the end of the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible, though unlikely, that the trend of the conformation changed over the study period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirdly, as all study dogs were recruited from the UK, the results may have limited significance on these breeds in other regions of the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nostril stenosis is a strong predictor of BOAS for all three breeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dogs with moderate to severe stenosis of the nostrils were at higher risk of developing BOAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BCS is significantly associated with BOAS in pugs and bulldogs with obese dogs having a higher risk of being BOAS (+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the conformation measurements, NGR is a valid predictor of BOAS in male bulldogs and highly reliable between different observers, thus it could potentially be used for breeding selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EWR and SI in pugs, and NGR and NLR in French bulldogs, SI in bulldogs, were associated with BOAS but had poor-moderate inter-observer reproducibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, they may be of use for directing the reformation of breed standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, the conformational and external factors as measured here contribute less than 50% of the variance that is seen in BOAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors strongly suggest using these in conjunction with regular clinical assessment of respiratory signs before and after exercise (BOAS Functional Grading).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, breeding toward extreme brachycephalic features should be strictly avoided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
