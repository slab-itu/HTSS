A New Megaraptoran Dinosaur (Dinosauria, Theropoda, Megaraptoridae) from the Late Cretaceous of Patagonia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A skeleton discovered in the Upper Cretaceous Sierra Barrosa Formation (Turonian-Coniacian) of Neuquén Province, Argentina represents a new species of theropod dinosaur related to the long snouted, highly pneumatized Megaraptoridae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotype specimen of Murusraptor barrosaensis n.gen et n.sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (MCF-PVPH-411) includes much of the skull, axial skeleton, pelvis and tibia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Murusraptor is unique in having several diagnostic features that include anterodorsal process of lacrimal longer than height of preorbital process, and a thick, shelf-like thickening on the lateral surface of surangular ventral to the groove between the anterior surangular foramen and the insert for the uppermost intramandibular process of the dentary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other characteristic features of Murusraptor barrosaensis n.gen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  et n. sp.include a large mandibular fenestra, distal ends of caudal neural spines laterally thickened into lateral knob-like processes, short ischia distally flattened and slightly expanded dorsoventrally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Murusraptor belongs to a Patagonian radiation of megaraptorids together with Aerosteon, Megaraptor and Orkoraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite being immature, it is a larger but more gracile animal than existing specimens of Megaraptor, and is comparable in size with Aerosteon and Orkoraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The controversial phylogeny of the Megaraptoridae as members of the Allosauroidea or a clade of Coelurosauria is considered analyzing two alternative data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the last decade, many new types of theropod dinosaurs have been described from the Upper Cretaceous sediments of South America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include abelisauroids [112], carcharodontosaurids [1315], dromaeosaurids [1618] and an assortment of species whose affinities are less certain [1920].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In 2001, the Argentinean-Canadian Dinosaur Project team collected fossils on Sierra Barrosa, 30 km northeast of Plaza Huincul, Neuquén Province, Argentina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rocks of this locality represent the last stratigraphic sequence of Upper Cretaceous beds of the Neuquén Group, and yield a unique association of terrestrial vertebrates including skeletons of turtles, crocodiles, saurischian dinosaurs, mammals and footprints of birds [2124].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the course of that expedition, a partial skeleton of a meat-eating dinosaur was recovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotype specimen (MCF-PVPH-411) of Murusraptor barrosaensis n. gen. et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  was approximately 6.5 meters long when it was alive, and had a proportionally long and low skull, small teeth, and highly pneumatized bones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a recent years, the Megaraptora [25],a clade of medium-sized, large-clawed and highly pneumatized theropods, was built to include the South American species Aerosteon riocoloradensis [26], Megaraptor namunhaiquii [27] and Orkoraptor burkei [28], together with the Australian Australovenator wintonensis [29], and the Japanese Fukuiraptor kitadaniensis [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the record of megaraptorans has been steadly nurtured by reports of the existence of their remains from Central Patagonia, Brazil and Australia [3134] and our anatomical knowledge of them has been substantially expanded by the descriptions of more informative specimens [3536].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The enigmatic nature of this group has been a matter of discussion since the description of the first megaraptoran, Megaraptor namunhaiquii [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interpretation of this taxon, based on its taxonomic relationships has migrated from one as an intriguing coelurosaur [27], to one as a basal Tetanurae with uncertain affinities [8], and finally to be considered the type genus of the Megaraptora [25], which was defined as the most inclusive clade comprising Megaraptor namunhaiquii but not Chilantaisaurus tashiukouensis, Neovenator salerii, Carcharodontosaurus saharicus or Allosaurus fragilis [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a stem-based taxon which, despite its broadly accepted and consensual validity, still presents some debate regarding their phylogenetic relationships within Theropoda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently [37] the clade Megaraptoridae was defined as a stem-based clade including all theropods closer to Megaraptor namunhuaiquii than to Fukuiraptor kitadaniensis, Chilantaisaurus tashiukouensis, Neovenator salerii, Carcharodontosaurus saharicus, Allosaurus fragilis, Baryonyx walkeri, Tyrannosaurus rex, and Passer domesticus, and involving within the clade, all South American forms plus Australovenator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Currently, the position of the megaraptorids among theropods is the subject of two alternative hypothesis: 1) as derived allosauroid neovenatorids [25,3839], and 2) as tyrannosauroid coelurosaurs [35,37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These different approaches of the phylogenetic relationships of this clade, although they both agree in the internal taxonomic composition, radically differ in regard the ancestry of the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These contentious phylogenetic hypotheses on both sides of the allosauroid-coelurosaur dichotomy are far from resolution, as it has been recognized in the most recent contributions [34,40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Murusraptor barrosaensis is one of the most informative megaraptorids known, having preserved the posterior elements of the skull and several postcranial elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the goal of this contribution is not the reexamination of the phylogenetic relationships of the megaraptorids, the specimen MCF-PVPH-411 of Murusraptor yields an important amount of new anatomical information that can be useful for future and deeper phylogenetical treatment of the clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The holotype specimen of Murusraptor barrosaensis (MCF-PVPH-411) was found preserved in a sand-filled channel deposit (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It was mostly disarticulated, although the bones had remained closely associated with each other, and included both large and small elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most collected ribs were in natural sequence parallel to each other, suggesting the specimen was partially articulated when buried.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clay nodules were mixed amongst the bones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientations of the ribs and pubes, and the distribution of bones suggest that the animal was lying on its right side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bones were stacked in as many as four layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The right ilium was standing vertically upside down.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete left ilium is the only element that was predepositionally broken; the preacetabular blade had snapped across the top of a large dorsal vertebra, and was separated slightly from the rest of the ilium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incompleteness of the other bones is erosional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several bones appear to have been bored by dermistids [4344], which left characteristic trails of osseous fragments in the sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parts of the skeleton showed pathologic damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison_with_Megaraptor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The three known associated skeletons of Megaraptor are from the older Portezuelo Formation, which is separated from the Sierra Barrosa Formation by Los Bastos Formation [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotype of Megaraptor namunhuaiquii (MCF-PVPH-079) was collected from Sierra del Portezuelo [27], which is 50 km to the west of where the skeleton of MCF-PVPH-411 was collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is no overlap of elements between the fossils that were described as the holotype of Megaraptor namunhuaiquii [27] and Murusraptor barrosaensis (MCF-PVPH-411).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in addition to the holotype material described, there are a number of unprepared and undescribed bones (MCF-PVPH-80) that were collected in association with MCF-PVPH-079, including four caudal vertebrae, two ribs (one almost complete), and gastralia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cluster of fossils was found far enough from the material described as the holotype of Megaraptor namunhuaiquii that the collectors could not be sure whether or not they belonged to the same specimen (Novas, personal communication 2004).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One almost complete dorsal rib would have been found associated with MCF-PVPH 79 (Novas, personal communication 2006).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centra of the caudal vertebrae are about 9.5 cm long, which is about the same size as the sacral vertebra of MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the undescribed centra have large pleurocoels, just like those of another Megaraptor specimen (MUCPv 341, [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the neural arches have not been well enough prepared for comparison with MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The centra of the anterior pair of caudal vertebrae of MCF-PVPH-079 are each about 10 cm long, which is about the same size as the first sacral centrum of MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing centrum length between the first sacral of MCF-PVPH-411 and the undamaged right side of the first caudal of MCF-PVPH-079 suggests that the two animals are about the same size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, comparison of the anterior centrum width and anterior centrum height of the same two specimens produces dimensions that are about 30% smaller, which suggests that MCF-PVPH-411 is a more lightly built animal than MCF-PVPH-079.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the centrum of MCF-PVPH-411 is narrowly waisted (maximum central width at midlength is 52 mm), the midlength width of the first caudal of MCF-PVPH-079 is much thicker (91 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neurocentral sutures of the MCF-PVPH-079 are fused, which indicates that the holotype was a more mature animal, in keeping with the fact that the size differences suggest it was a larger animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these measurements compare vertebrae that are separated by four positions in the vertebral column, they do suggest that the holotype of Megaraptor namunhuaiquii was a slightly longer, more massive and more mature animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of slight differences in size and robustness, there are some fundamental similarities in the two specimens that are only rarely found in other theropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like the first sacral vertebra of MCF-PVPH-411, the undescribed centra of MCF-PVPH-079 have large pleurocoels (as they do in the second Megaraptor specimen described by Calvo et al., [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neural arches of MCF-PVPH-079 are neither well-preserved nor well-prepared, but again show the same fundamental features as MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The internal cancellous structure is widely open and suggestive of its pneumatic nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anterolateral surface of the base of the transverse process is concave ventral to the base of the prezygapophysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the right side of MCF-PVPH-079, the concavity is pierced by three pneumatopores, the largest of which has a diameter of 11 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transverse processes of MCF-PVPH-079, like those of MCF-PVPH-411, extend as much posteriorly as they do laterally, so that the distal ends would have terminated at a level well behind the back of the postzygapophyses and centrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neural spines are long anteroposteriorly, flat lateromedially, and are deeply excavated on the midline both anteriorly and posteriorly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other two caudals of MCF-PVPH-079 are similar in length to the first two caudals, but the centra are lower and narrower, which suggests that they were separated in the living animal by several vertebral positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two left ribs with heads of MCF-PVPH-079 are similar in morphology and size to the anterior dorsal ribs of MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger of the two is 90 cm long on the outside curve (between tuberculum and distal end), compared with an 82 cm length of the fifth dorsal rib of MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rib is broken in two places, and one of the two fractures appears to have been partly healed before death, whereas the other break seems to be post-mortem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance between the tuberculum and capitulum is 165 mm in MCF-PVPH-079, and 160 mm in MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tuberculum is offset posteriorly in both specimens, whereas the capitulum widens near the articular end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases the shafts curve continuously throughout their length, but flatten out distally (the cross-section of MCF-PVPH-079 is 15 x 35 mm, whereas that of MCF-PVPH-411 is 10 x 33 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second rib with a head from MCF-PVPH-079 is incomplete ventrally, but the head and proximal shaft are comparable with the eighth dorsal rib of MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum distance between the edges of the tuberculum and capitulum is 175 mm in MCF-PVPH-079, and 160 mm in MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several nearly complete gastralia are preserved in MCF-PVPH-079, in addition to numerous fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most complete right medial gastralium has a straight-line, lateromedial width of 51 cm, but is 56 cm when measured on the outside curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into account the curvature of the gastralium and the position of the midline of the body, the minimum width of the chest can be estimated as 80 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lateral to the ventromedial, tapering section near the midline, the gastralium expands by means of thin anterior and posterior flanges to an anteroposterior length of 4 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is precisely the situation seen in MCF-PVPH-411, although there is clearly fusion between right and left medial gastralia and the anteroposterior length of the expansion is somewhat greater (up to 44 mm in an anterior medial pair of gastralia).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These and other clues suggest that the medial gastralium of MCF-PVPH-079 was from a more posterior position than those of MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pair of fused gastralia of MCF-PVPH-079 seem to represent an even more posterior position in the abdomen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It includes a complete, 22 cm long lateral gastralium that contacts 17.5 cm of the distal tapering end of the medial gastralium, which is incomplete proximally (medially).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distal (dorsolateral) end of the lateral gastralium is T-shaped in cross section where it would have overlapped the ventral end of the dorsal rib in life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two gastralia are not fused for most of the overlapping region, but are indistinguishably fused at the proximal (ventromedial) end of the lateral gastralium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gastralia are similar to those of MCF-PVPH-411, and although many features are still covered by matrix, the shape of the dorsal rib head is almost identical to the fifth dorsal rib of MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A medial fragment of the distal end of the right tibia of suggests that the tibia of Megaraptor has the same morphology as that of MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distal surface of the tibia of MCF-PVPH-079 is deeply furrowed, suggesting that it is from a more mature individual than MCF-PVPH-411 in which the distal surface is smooth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An anteroposterior measurement of the distal end of MCF-PVPH-411 is 72% the same dimension in the holotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A second partial skeleton of Megaraptor (MUCPv 341) was collected on the north shore of Los Barreales Lake [8,75], which is 45 km north of where the skeleton of Murusraptor barrosaensis was collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is considerable overlap of elements in the two Megaraptor skeletons (MCF-PVPH 79, MUCPv 341), although the Barreales specimen is 92% the size of the holotype (based on five measurements of the ulna, manual phalanx I-1 and manual ungual I-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MUCPv 341 includes a cervical vertebra, several caudal vertebrae, dorsal ribs, two haemal arches, and a pubis that can be compared with MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neural arch of the cervical vertebra of MUCPv 341 can only be compared indirectly with that of the anterior dorsal of MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presacral column, these two vertebrae were separated by at least three positions and it is not surprising that there are many significant differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diapopostzygaphophyseal lamina is well developed in both specimens, but MUCPv 341 is different in that a pair of pneumatopores are present in each side of the neural arch [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prezygapophyses are well-separated in both specimens, and the articular surfaces are mounted on short pedicels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distal ends of the diapophyses are triangular in section, and are supported by laminae that bound depressions with asymmetrically distributed pneumatopores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not surprisingly, the epipophysis of the cervical of MUCPv 341 is more pronounced than that of the anterior dorsal of MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no ridge connecting the epipophysis with the prezygapophysis in the dorsal vertebra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both specimens have strong interspinous ligament scars along the entire heights of both the fronts and backs of the neural spines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As pointed out by Calvo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [8], this is different from the conditions in many other theropods where the interspinous ligament scars are more strongly developed distally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cervical of MUCPv 341 is relatively smaller than the anterior dorsal of MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The two caudal vertebrae of MUCPv 341 are pathologic in that they are fused to each other and to the haemal arch between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together the fused centra are 152 mm long.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calvo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [75] postulated that they were proximal to caudal 8 in position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, based on the size of the transverse processes compared with the transition point in other theropods, they could be as far back as the twelfth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are no caudal centra associated with MCF-PVPH-411, but three neural spines of anterior caudals can be compared with MUCPv 341.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neural spine heights of the fused caudals of MUCPv 341 are no more than 154 mm (from the top of the canal to the top of the spine), which lower than any of the three preserved spines (213, 183, 156 mm respectively) of Murusraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that morphologically the closest of the three to the fused two caudals of MUCPv 341 appears to be the mid-sized one suggests that the Barrosa theropod was larger than the Barreales Megaraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphologically, the caudal neural arches of both animals are very similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neural spines of MUCPv 341 are slightly taller than their corresponding centra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are no associated centra in MCF-PVPH-411, the caudal neural spines are all taller than the sacral centrum, which is similar to MUCPv 341 in which the caudal neural arches are taller than the centra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of pneumatopores in the sacral centrum of Murusraptor (MCF-PVPH-411) suggests that pneumatopores might have been present in the caudal vertebrae of the same specimen, just as they are in MUCPv 341 and the holotype of Megaraptor namunhuaiquii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scarring for intraspinous ligaments is well developed on the front and back margins of the neural spines in both specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elongate transverse processes of MUCPv 341 and the more posterior two caudal vertebrae of MCF-PVPH-411 are plate-like and horizontal, and are supported ventrally by a pair of converging buttresses that bound pneumatic recesses and/or pneumatopores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a particularly strong indication that these animals are closely related.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As pointed out by Calvo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [8], Torvosaurus may be the only other theropod with similar buttressing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The haemal arches of both specimens are quite similar in shape, size and inclination (as determined by the proximal intervertebral articulation and the length of the trough extending down the back of the spine from the haemal canal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One haemal arch of MUCPv 341 is fused to the coossified caudal centra, and presumably therefore preserves its natural position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spine has an axial length of 185 mm, although the distal end extends only 140 mm below the level of the ventral surface of the vertebrae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second, unattached haemal arch is 151 mm long, and is clearly from further back in the tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one haemal arch was recovered with MCF-PVPH-411, and it is taller (238 mm) than either of the two chevrons of MUCPv 341.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the absolute and relative size of the haemal canal is larger in Murusraptor, showing that it is from a position more anterior in the tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the haemal arches of both specimens are fundamentally the same posteriorly curving, bladelike structures with dorsally closed haemal arches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distal to the haemal canal on the dorsoposterior surface of the haemal spine, there is no process in MUCPv 341.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This slight difference might just have something to do with the chevrons of this specimen being more posterior in the tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The single ungual recovered of Murusraptor is slightly smaller than the third ungual of the hand of MUCPv 341, even though the former specimen appears to be larger than the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It lacks a distinct flexor tubercle, which could represent a real anatomical difference between the two specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Only the proximal ends of both pubes were recovered with Murusraptor, whereas most of the right pubis is known for MUCPv 341 [8] (Fig 24B24D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both specimens the iliac suture is anteroposteriorly elongate, and the acetabular region of the bone is reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ischial suture is high but narrow in Murusraptor, as it is in MUCPv 341, which Calvo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [8] found comparable with basal tetanurans like Torvosaurus and Piatnitzkysaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall length of the proximal head of the pubis is bigger in Murusraptor, but is more robust in the Barreales Megaraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences do not seem to be related to postmortem distortion, and are accentuated by morphological differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anterior edge of the pubis just below the iliac suture is more sharply defined in MCF-PVPH-411 because the lateral (and to a lesser extent also the medial) surface(s) posterior to the edge are concave, whereas they are convex in MUCPv 341.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The iliac sutural surface is flatter dorsally in MUCPv 341, lacks pneumatopores and is inclined to face dorsomedially rather than dorsally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both specimens, the pubis is advanced in that the obturator foramen has been opened up, which is not true in basal tetanurans like Torvosaurus and Piatnitzkysaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The iliac and ischial sutural surfaces are almost perpendicular to each other in both specimens, which is something that is not common in other theropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of the several types of theropod teeth found at Los Barreales [7677], all have been difficult to associate with the Megaraptor skeletal material because of the nature of bonebeds [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, some of the teeth from Los Barreales are very similar to those associated with Murusraptor and can be assigned with confidence to Megaraptora.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MUCPv 723, for example is a rooted tooth with a total height of 49 mm, a Fore-Aft Base Length of 13 mm, and sixteen denticles per five millimetres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are only five serrations at the tip of the anterior carina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shapes of the tooth and its denticles, the positions of the carinae, and the measurements all fall within the range of the teeth found with the Barreales theropod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, a juvenile specimen of Megaraptor namunhuaquii (MUCPv 595) was communicated with skull and postcranials elements preserved [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specimen includes a partial skull and an articulated vertebral sequence of nine cervicals (including the axis) and twelve dorsals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circular foramen magnum of MUCPv 595 is rimmed by basioccipital, exoccipitals and supraoccipital as in Murusraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both specimens show a quadrangular frontal, although MUCPv 595 seens to be slightly narrower posteriorly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exoccipital-opisthotic complex is separated from each other by the supraoccipital in both forms as well as the presence of a deep excavation of the dorsal surface of the occipital condylar neck and a subcondylar recess on its ventral surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MUCPv 595 and Murusraptor show basal tubera separated by a wider space than the diameter of the occipital condyle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although postranial elements are briefly described in that contribution, some comparisons can be done upon the figured bones (Figure 8 in [35]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the available vertebrae of Murusraptor show, despite the size diference and possible a more mature ontogenic stage, a lighter arquitecture on the neural arch laminae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the neural arches of Murusraptor seem to be relatively shorter anteroposteriorly and taller dorsoventrally than those from MUCPv 595, likely due the different ontogenic stages of each specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In lateral view, the centrodiapophyseal laminae of Murusraptor are forked in anterior and posterior branches at mid-high of the laminae, whereas in the juvenile specimen MUCPv 595 of Megaraptor seem to be separated up to its contact with the diapophysis (Fig 17C, Figure 8D in [35]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The only dorsal centrum preserved in Murusraptor bears a deep lateral pleurocoel with not a well marked dorsal border, unlike the specimen MUCPv 595 that has lateral pleurocoels with well defined enclosing borders (Figure 8C-D in [35]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_with_Aerosteon  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The holotype material of Aerosteon (MCNA-PV-3137) from the Anacleto Formation of Mendoza [26] includes a single associated tooth crown with three denticles per millimeter on both anterior and posterior carinae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tooth is relatively small considering how large the animal was, but nevertheless is about ten percent larger than the largest known tooth of Murusraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anterior serrations extend along most of the height of the crown of the supposed Aerosteon tooth, which is considerably different than the condition in Murusraptor in which the anterior denticles are restricted to the tip of the tooth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the tooth closely resembles the teeth of abelisaurids [37,78], there is a strong possibility that the tooth identified as belonging to Aerosteon is incorrectly associated with this animal; it may in fact have been from an abelisaurid that was scavenging the Aerosteon carcass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The prefrontal of Aerosteon is anteroposteriorly long but low [26] as in Murusraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The postorbitals of the two animals are virtually identical in morphology and size, although the specimen from Mendoza has a weakly developed orbital rugosity [26] that is not present in Murusraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The facet identified on the medial surface of MCNA-PV-3137 as the suture for the laterosphenoid [26] was misidentified; it does not have a sutural surface, it is too large, extends too far ventrally, and should be continuous with the posteroventral surface of the frontal suture as in all other theropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quadrates of Aerosteon and Murusraptor are the same in major features and size, but have differences in details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most diagnostic features that they share are the presence of a large quadratic foramen that is entirely enclosed within the quadrate, and is positioned dorsal to the large pneumatic foramen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The holotype of Aerosteon includes much of the vertebral column, including cervicals (Ce1, Ce4, Ce6, Ce8), dorsals (D1, D4-D11, D14), sacrals (S2-S5) and one caudal (Ca1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presacrals 17 and 20, many of the sacrals and the first caudal are known for both MCNA-PV-3137 (Aerosteon) and MCF-PVPH-411 (Murusraptor), and overlapping dimensions suggest that the former is no more than 10% larger than the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lengths, widths and heights of centra and neural arches are closely comparable for vertebrae from similar parts of the column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All diagnostic characters, including the presence and absence of pneumatic ones, are the same in the two specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ilia of MCNA-PV-3137 (Aerosteon) and MCF-PVPH-411 (Murusraptor) are anatomically indistinguishable, although there are differences in proportions (Fig 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For example, the ilium of MCNA-PV-3137 is only 2.4% longer than that of Murusraptor (MCF-PVPH-411), but is 17.5% taller above the acetabulum (Fig 28 and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antiliac blade is about the same length in the known specimens of Aerosteon and Murusraptor, but the postiliac blade is slightly longer in the former.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are also slight differences in the positions of pneumatopores on the medial surface of the ilium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximal ends of the pubes are present in both specimens, and show that no significant anatomical differences between the orientations of these bones in the two taxa, nor in the proportions of the iliac and ischial peduncles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_with_Orkoraptor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Orkoraptor burkei [28] is another megaraptoran with clear affinities to Murusraptor (MCF-PVPH-411).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collected at Cerro Los Hornos from Cenomanian-Santonian rocks in the province of Santa Cruz in southern Patagonia, the specimen includes cranial (nasal, postorbital, quadratojugal, teeth) and postcranial (vertebrae, chevrons, ribs, tibia) material, and was clearly an unusual theropod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incomplete tibia was estimated to have been about 60 cm in length [28], which is only slightly shorter than the tibia of MCF-PVPH-411.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The teeth and postorbital are similar to those of Murusraptor (MCF-PVPH-411).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like Megaraptor [8] and probably MCF-PVPH-411, the caudals have pneumatopores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in preservation and the incompleteness of this specimen make it difficult to determine its precise relationships with Murusraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of an anterior carina was scored for lateral teeth of Orkoraptor [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in Murusraptor, the anterior carina is restricted to the distal tip of each lateral tooth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this region cannot be seen in any specimen of Orkoraptor, this character has been rescored from 1 to ?.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Phylogenetic_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phylogenetic relationships of Megaraptoridae are currently the focus of intense debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interesting clade of South American theropods is, at present, considered alternatively as member of the Allosauroidea [25,38] or as the sister group of the Tyrannosauroidea [35,37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, in order to establish the phylogenetic relationships of Murusraptor, two alternative data matrices were considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we tested the data set proposed by Carrano et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [38], plus modifications proposed by Zanno and Makovicky [39] and three new characters (Analysis A, see S1 and S2 Files).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we tested the data set proposed by Novas et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [37] plus the modifications from Porfiri et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [35] (Analysis B, see S1 and S2 Files).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to facilitate the reading of each analysis, the character numbers from Analysis A are in regular type, wheras the character numbers from Analysis B are shown in bold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both analyses were processed by using the TNT software [42] with the application of Traditional Search analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results obtained from Analysis A consists in 358 cranial and postcranial characters distributed among 64 theropod taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Traditional Search option provided 4650 most parsimonious trees (MPTs) of 1097 steps with a Consistency Index of 0.392 and Retention Index of 0.680.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strict consensus showed a monophyletic Neovenatoridae [25] that includes an unsolved politomy among Neovenator, Siats meekorum, Chilantaisaurus and the Megaraptora [25] (Fig 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Numbers in nodes indicate Bremer support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157973.g029  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Murusraptor is nested within the Megaraptora (sensu [25]) as a member of a group formed exclusively by the South American taxa (that includes Aerosteon, Megaraptor, and Orkoraptor) that here are identified as members of the Megaraptoridae [37], which also includes Australovenator and Fukuiraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pruned Trees option shows the mostly incomplete taxa Metriacanthosaurus, Tyrannotitan, Streptospondylus, Poekilopleuron, Magnosaurus, Chilantaisaurus and Siats meektorum as wildcards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When these seven taxa were inactivated, the new analysis resulted in only 7 MPTs of 1073 steps, with CI = 0.400 and RI = 0.691.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced consensus recovered Neovenator as the sister taxon of Megaraptora, with no changes in the topology previously obtained for Murusraptor and other megaraptorids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Murusraptor shares with all Megaraptoridae two unambiguous synapomorphies: teeth with no enamel wrinkles (interpreted as a reversion to primitive condition in Theropoda) (character 143); and anterior caudal vertebrae with neural arch bearing prominent centrodiapophysial laminae that define a deep infradiapophysial fossa (character 205).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, due incompleteness of available evidence of some of the members of the clade, Murusraptor shares other features with some members of the Megaraptoridae: dorsal vertebrae with distinct step-like ridge lateral to hyposphene (character 189) and medial gastralia fused on midline (character 356) (unknown in Orkoraptor); maxillary and dentary teeth with anterior carina restricted to the dental tip (10 or fewer denticles) (character 147, unknown in Aerosteon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Murusraptor and Megaraptor share the presence of a basioccipital with a sharp dorsoventrally oriented laminae situated immediately ventral to the occipital condyle, proximal caudals neural spines with distal squared thickeness, and lateral borders of frontals parallel to midline (character 91, 357, 358; unknown in Orkoraptor and Aerosteon), and dorsal vertebrae with pneumaticity/webbing at the base of the neural spines (character 181, unknown in Orkoraptor and primitive stage in Aerosteon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Murusraptor shares with Orkoraptor a postorbital with a ventral process with U-shaped cross-section (character 57, unknown in Megaraptor and primitive stage in Aerosteon) and with Aerosteon an ilium highy pneumatized brevis fossa and sacral attachments (character 262, unknown in Orkoraptor and Megaraptor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Murusraptor also shares with Neovenator and megaraptorids (unknown in Orkoraptor) the presence of middle and posterior dorsal vertebrae with postzygapophyses bearing tab-like lateral extensions of articular facets (character 190), ilium with string developed ridge on medial surface adjacent to preacetabular notch (character 273, unknown in Megaraptor and Orkoraptor) and tibia with anterolateral condyle prominent and ventrally curved (character 321, unknown in Megaraptor and Aerosteon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of transversely narrow manual ungueals is shared by Murusraptor, Megaraptor, Fukuiraptor and Australovenator (character 260, unknown in Neovenator, Orkoraptor and Aeosteon), whereas Murusraptor, Australovenator and Aerosteon share a tibia with anteromedial buttress for astragalus bearing bluntly rounded vertical ridge on medial side (character 322, unknown in Fukuiraptor, Orkoraptor and Megaraptor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the results from Analysis B were obtained from a matrix of 284 characters distributed among 46 theropod taxa, which included the character scoring for Murusraptor (see S1 and S2 Files).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis results in a best score of 934 steps and 214 MPTs., with a CI = 0.370 and a RI = 0.653.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis is rooted in Ceratosaurus as the outgroup and the consensus tree shows a unsolved politomy at the level of all Neotetanurae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some taxa are indicated as conflictive according the Pruning option of the software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, Carcharondontosaurus iguidensis, Eotyrannus, Chilantaisaurus, Kileskus, Eocarcharia and Santanaraptor were inactivated for a second running.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike Porfiri et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [35], Orkoraptor was kept among the active taxa because its importance within the megaraptors and its comparison with Murusraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this second analysis, 4 MPTs of 902 steps were obtained, with a CI = 0.384 and RI: 0.672.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Murusraptor is recovered as a megaraptorid in the Analysis B (Fig 30) and a monophyletic clade formed by all South American taxa plus Fukuiraptor and Australovenator is also recovered as a unsolved politomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157973.g030  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the basis of the analysis carried on Analysis B, Murusraptor shares with all known megaraptorids the presence of proximal caudal vertebrae with centrodiapophyseal laminae comparable in prominence or more developed than those of the dorsal vertebrae (character 115, also present in some spinosaurids).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shared characters with some megaraptorids but unknown in others involve teeth without mesial denticles (character 2, unknown in Aerosteon but also present in Sinosauropteryx and Compsognathus), dorsal ribs proximally pierced by foramina (character 116, also present in some allosaurids) and more than a pair of gastralia proximally fused at midline with expanded club-shaped proximal ends (character 117, also present in tyrannosauroids and neovenatorids) (both characters unknown in Orkoraptor but also present in Australovenator); pubis with pubic tubercle present as a convexity on the anterior margin of the pubis (character 158, unknown in Orkoraptor but also present in Velociraptor and Guanlong).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Murusraptor and Aerosteon share the lateral surface of ilium with large external foramina and internal (character 245, unknown in Orkoraptor and Megaraptor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According this analysis, the nesting of Murusraptor within Tyrannosauroidea is supported by sixteen sinapomorphies: maxillary and dentary teeth crowns with mesial and distal margins strongly curved, with the apex positioned well distally from the distal margin (character 8); reduced or absent prefrontal (character 39); quadrate with a deep recess on the anterior surface where the pterygoid wing and condyles meet (character 67, also in Giganotosaurus and Mapusaurus); supraacetabular crest of the ilium with a maximum lateral projection subequal relative to ischial peduncle (character 151); tibia with the medial malleolus oriented almost medially, 'shoulder' absent (character 187, also present in Neovenator); distal medial malleolus of the tibia expanded 40% or more than tibial mid-shaft width (character 190, also present in allosauroids); lateral malleolus of the tibia extended distally beyond the medial malleolous more than 5% of tibial total length with respect to medial malleolus (character 191, also present in Neovenator and carcharodontosaurids); tibia with lateral condyle of proximal end curving ventrally as a pointed process (character 246, also present in Neovenator); ratio of anteroposterior length a single frontal exposed on skull roof to mediolateral width at midpoint less than 2.0 (character 261, also present in Allosaurus and Shaochilong); ventral ramus of the postorbital substantially anteroposteriorly wider than ventral ramus of the lacrimal at midpoint, parietal with the skull table between supratemporal fosase extremely reduced, sagittal crest or crests pinched between opposing fosae and basisphenoid recess of the basipterygoid oriented posteroventrally, recess partially or widely visible in posterior view (characters 263, 266 and 269, also present in carcharodontosaurids); and basisphenoid with pronounced muscle scars flanking basisphenoid recess.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the other hand, Murusraptor exhibits the plesiomorphic stage among Tyrannosauroidea by having premaxillary teeth subequal in size to rostral maxillary teeth, premaxillary teeth with recurved posterior crowns, and premaxillary teeth without median vertical ridge on lingual surface (characters 3, 5, 6, also present in Megaraptor and Fukuiraptor); an orbit with a rounded contour, lacrimal-postorbital contact absent, and postorbital with dorsally oriented anterior process (characters 16, 44, 51, also present in Orkoraptor and Aerosteon); size of the external mandibular fenestra more than 10% total mandibular length, dorsoventral depth of the surangular less than half the maximum width of the mandible above the mandibular fenestra, tibia with a maximum length equal to or less than 12 times the anteroposterior width at mid-length, a roughly symmetric calcaneum with wide angles in the posterior border, a lateral condyle of the at the posterior rear with its posterior margin located at the same than the posterior margin of the medial condyle, absence of a vertical ridge on iliac blade above acetabulum (characters 85, 87, 186, 201, 221, 242, also present in Aerosteon); articular with the mediolateral width of jaw muscle attachment site less than the width of glenoid for articulation with quadrate, and a smooth non-articular region between glenoid and attachment site for depressor mandibular muscles (characters 275 and 276).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, according the results obtained by running the data set from Analysis B and the position of Megaraptora among tyrannosauroids, Murusraptor exhibits seventeen characters that are interpreted as convergencies of this taxon with non-tyrannosauroid theropods: spiral suture postorbital-squamosal articulation with a wide medial process (character 45, also present in carcharodontosaurids); lacrimal with a small pneumatic recess (character 54, also present in allosauroids); lacrimal with no lacrimal horn (character 55, also in some basal tetanurans); quadrate foramen present, surrounded by the quadrate (character 66, also present in Aerosteon and some basal allosauroids); a highly pneumatic braincase (character 69, also present in Megaraptor and carcharodontosaurids); basal tubera formed by basioccipital and basisphenoid, not subdivided (basioccipital located posteriorly and basisphenoid located anteriorly) (character 70, also present in basal allosauroids); paroccipital processes strongly tilted ventrally, with its distal end entirely located under the ventral level of the foramen magnum (character 72, also present in Allosauroidea); laterosphenoid with the opening for V cranial nerve located posterior to the nuchal crest (character 73, also present in carcharodontosaurids); presence of a deep and funnel-shaped fossa in the basisphenoid (character 78, also present in Megaraptor and carcharodontosaurids); dorsal expansion width of the supraoccipital at least twice the width of foramen magnum (character 81, also present in Xiongguanlong and carcharodontosaurids); ectopterygoid with a pneumatic recess as a deep and subcircular depression (character 84, also present in allosauroids); posterior dorsal vertebrae centra shorter than its depth (character 107, also present in Albertosaurus, Neovenator and Acrocanthosaurus); anteriorly oriented neural spines of posterior dorsals (character 108, also present in aerosteon and some allosauroids); sacral vertebrae with pleurocoels (character 109, also present in Megaraptor, some carcharodontosaurids and Tyrannosaurus); caudal vertebrae with, hyposphene-hypantrum accesory articulationswell-developed and extended approximately along the first third of the tail (character 111, also present in Tyrannosaurus and basal allosauroids); ischium with a distal expansión (character 169, also present in Giganotosaurus and Mapusaurus); and a lacrimal with a suborbital process (character 230, also present in some allosauroids).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phylogenetic relationships of Murusraptor barrosaensis are, beyond any reasonable doubt, sufficiently supported as a Megaraptoridae and, even more importantly, probably a member of a more inclusive taxon representing a South American diversification of megaraptorids together with Megaraptor, Aerosteon and Orkoraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The polarization between the hypotheses involving the phylogenetic relationships of the Megaraptoridae, is probably due the utilization of certain different selection criteria in the comparative taxomomic universe (including the outgroup taxa chosen to check the plesiopmorphic stage of the characters) and the relative consideration of the phylogenetic relevance of the chosen morphological features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eventually, further discoveries of more elecuent specimens in older rocks from both South America and Australia will help to a better understanding of the early evolution of the clade and, therefore, clarify its basal phylogenetic affinities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
