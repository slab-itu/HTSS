Amber in prehistoric Iberia: New data and a review  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Provenancing exotic raw materials and reconstructing the nature and routes of exchange is a major concern of prehistoric archaeology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amber has long been recognised as a key commodity of prehistoric exchange networks in Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most science-based studies so far have been localised and based on few samples, hence making it difficult to observe broad geographic and chronological trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paper concentrates on the nature, distribution and circulation of amber in prehistoric Iberia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present new standardised FTIR analyses of 22 archaeological and geological samples from a large number of contexts across Iberia, as well as a wide scale review of all the legacy data available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of a considerable body of data, we can confirm the use of local amber resources in the Northern area of the Iberian Peninsula from the Palaeolithic to the Bronze Age; we push back the arrival of Sicilian amber to at least the 4th Millennium BC, and we trace the appearance of Baltic amber since the last quarter of the 2nd Millennium BC, progressively replacing Sicilian simetite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrating these data with other bodies of archaeological information, we suggest that the arrival of Baltic amber was part of broader Mediterranean exchange networks, and not necessarily the result of direct trade with the North.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a methodological perspective, thanks to the analyses carried out on both the vitreous core and the weathered surfaces of objects made of Sicilian simetite, we define the characteristic FTIR bands that allow the identification of Sicilian amber even in highly deteriorated archaeological samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Amber and other unusual materials such as jade, obsidian and rock crystal, have attracted interest as raw materials for the manufacture of decorative items since Late Prehistory, and indeed amber retains a high value in present-day jewellery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are many aspects that come into play when assessing the social value of these raw materials, ranging from intrinsic material properties (colour, texture, hardness ) that can render them appealing for the manufacture of adornments, to other environmental or cultural aspects that may relate, for example, to their relative scarcity and subsequent added value as exotic or 'exclusive'.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the circulation of unusual raw materials can be traced back to Prehistory, and the Iberian Peninsula is no exception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For obsidian and jade, this movement is known to have taken place since early dates in the Late Prehistory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, we can mention the Lipari and Pantelleria obsidian circuits in the Central Mediterranean that reached North Africa between the 6th and the 2nd Millennia BC [13]; the Alpine jade axes that circulated in Western Europe reaching Britain and the South-West of the Iberian Peninsula since at least the 5th Millennium BC [46]; or the variscite from the South-West of the Iberian Peninsula that has been documented in French megaliths from the 4th Millennium BC [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As for amber, there is evidence of use since the Late Palaeolithic (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [8]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous paper [9], two of us presented a diachronic perspective of the patterns of amber use in the Prehistory of the Iberian Peninsula, as well as of the sources that supplied it and the contact and exchange circuits that occurred as a result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In broad terms, we observed: the use of local resources in the Northern parts of the Peninsula (the area in which the largest geological deposits of amber are concentrated) from the Palaeolithic to the Bronze Age; a significant increase in amber items during the Neolithic and especially the Chalcolithic period across the whole Iberia, concurrent with the arrival of foreign amberin particular Sicilian simetite; and a decrease in the use of amber during the Bronze Age, which appeared restricted geographically to the North-East of the Peninsula, when all of the analysed amber is of Baltic origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baltic amber again appeared with increasing frequency during the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this proposal was based on very limited archaeometric evidence, including only 18 archaeological sites with objects sampled, out of the over 85 where amber objects have been documented (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202235.t001  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we present a new set of analyses of archaeological and geological amber that greatly expands previous coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking advantage of the growing body of data, and synthesising all the information available, this paper sets out to provide an up-to-date review of the evidence concerning the nature, distribution and circulation of amber in Prehistoric Iberia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This holistic perspective is contextualised more broadly in current discussion about the circulation of materials, knowledge and people in European Prehistory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the last five years, there have been major developments in our understanding of Iberian amber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a geological point of view, we highlight the project 'Iberian Amber: An Exceptional Record of Cretaceous Forests at the Rise of Modern Terrestrial Ecosystems', with the involvement of one of us (E.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), focused on the palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the ecosystems that generated the large Cretaceous amber deposits known in the Iberian Peninsula (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From an archaeological point of view, the publication of the monograph on the tholos of Montelirio, in Valencina de la Concepción, Seville [11]a large Megalithic monument were more than 250 amber objects were deposited among other exotic materialshas revealed the largest assemblage of amber objects from Iberian Prehistory to date [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we have had opportunity to analyse amber from some of the most iconic sites in the South of the Iberian Peninsula, such as the tholos of Montelirio and the Dolmen of La Pastora in Valencina de la Concepción, or the site of Los Millares.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two sites further inland and also sampled, the megalithic tomb of La Velilla and the hypogeum of the Valle de las Higueras, have provided data to complement that from the hypogeum of Almada.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These new analyses increase our coverage of Chalcolithic sites with amber from 1% to 15% (Table 1), thus allowing a rather more representative view than possible in 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equally, the new analyses from Quinta do Marcelo, Llano de la Teja 18 and Llano de la Sabina 97 and 99 constitute the first analytical data for these very well-known contexts and they open up interesting opportunities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to archaeological samples, we have expanded the characterisation of geological samples from six areas of the Iberian Peninsula, following identical protocols and hence ensuring data compatibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include deposits of amber from the Cantabrian Range, Navarra, Asturias, Teruel, Castellón and Jaén (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
No permits were required for the analysis of geological samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Permits for the analyses of archaeological samples were granted by the Chief Curators and Heads of the museums listed in the table, under the R&D projects: HAR2017-82685-R, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities; and PN623183 funded by the European Commission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202235.t002  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to characterise the samples, analyses were carried out via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), which is well-established as a reliable technique for the characterisation and sourcing of amber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra obtained were compared with both reference spectra of geological samples previously available, and the new geological spectra presented in this article.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new specimens were analysed using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum Two FTIR spectrometer at the Wolfson Archaeological Science Laboratories of the UCL Institute of Archaeology (UK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This instrument allows for Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) analyses and hence potentially totally non-invasive analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most of the archaeological objects studied here are held or exhibited at various museums in Spain and Portugal, and for curatorial concerns the extraction of a very small sample was preferable to moving the whole objects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, pellets were made using approximately 2 mg of analyte which was ground by hand in an agate mortar and mixed with a small amount of KBr, before pressing the mixture in a 13 mm diameter mould in order to produce 1 mm thick discs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were collected as infrared transmission spectra after scanning each specimen 50 times in the range 4000370 cm-1, with a resolution of 4 cm-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of our raw spectra are included in full as Supporting Information (S1 File) to facilitate future reuse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Amber_resources_in_Iberia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Around 150 localities with Cretaceous amber have been documented in the Iberian Peninsula [10, 13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these amber deposits are Albian in age (Early Cretaceous) and only some localities in Asturias and in Catalonia date from the Late Cretaceous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, only two localities with amber from the Late Triassic Period are known, both in Alicante.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the amber deposits are distributed in a strip that goes from the East to the North of the Iberian Peninsula, corresponding approximately with the marine coastline during the Early Cretaceous (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this strip, amber deposits are mainly concentrated in three geological contexts: The Maestrazgo Basin, the Basque-Cantabrian Basin and the Central Asturian Depression [10, 14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Towards the South, three localities with relatively minor amber occurrences are known in Puerto del Boyar (Cádiz) [15, 16]; Navalperal (Jaén) and Almargen (Málaga).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this day, two of these three localities lack systematic study and FTIR characterisation, and in the last case of Almargen, the references are vague: in the early 20thcentury Mr. S. Calderón [17] referred to the existence of a unique piece of amber from Almargen in the possession of Mr. F. Chaves [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some of the amber deposits have undergone intense palaeobotanic and geochemical study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There have been systematic studies using FTIR of the most important localities such as Sant Just in the Maestrazgo Basin, or Peñacerrada and El Soplao in the Basque-Cantabrian Basin [1922], to which we can add analyses of individual samples from Cóbreces and Comillas in the Basque-Cantabrian Basin; La Clusa in Catalonia; Hoz Seca in Guadalajara or the aforementioned analysis of Puerto del Boyar [8, 10, 16, 23, 24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Geological samples of the main deposits have been selected as references in the present work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One sample from Jaén province (Navalperal) has also been included due to its closer proximity to some of the archaeological sites considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geological samples analysed are presented in the following sections (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Maestrazgo_Basin_(Localities_of_San_Just__Teruel__and_La_Hoya_in_Castellón)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Maestrazgo Basin, which reached a sediment thickness of 6.5 km during the Mesozoic, is an intra-continental basin located in the Iberian Range that underwent two significant stages of rift during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous; the rift structure is characterised by a system of faults that divide the Maestrazgo Basin into different blocks [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, sedimentation is dominated by sandstones, limestones and marlstones deposited in a marine environment with shallow freshwater environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amber is generally associated with organic silt deposits containing coal [10], with the largest deposits being San Just, La Hoya and Arroyo de la Pascueta, all in the Escucha Formation [10] or perhaps the Utrillas Group, according to the new data published by Barrón et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [14] from the amber deposits in the Basque-Cantabrian Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The San Just deposit has grey-black clay stones with abundant plant remains and fusinised wood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palynological studies suggest a subtropical hot-humid environment with hot and dry areas [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The FTIR spectrum from San Just was published by Peñalver et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [22] and is characterised, just like the spectrum from Álava [19], by two intense bands at 1724 cm-1 corresponding to the carbonyl group and the simple C-H bond respectively, with another band at 856 cm-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of the band of the exocyclic methylene group at 1640 and 880 cm-1 is significant, as it indicates a high level of maturity (including diagenetic effects) which would be consistent with its Cretaceous age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The La Hoya deposit, in Cortes de Arenoso municipality, contains abundant amber combined with coals and other vegetal remains deposited in deltaic environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insects have been documented in the amber as bioinclusions [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples from these localities analysed by us present practically identical spectra in which we observe the same general characteristics as in the previous samples (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Context_of_archaeological_samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following sections provide some archaeological background to the samples reported here, while our discussion will integrate these new data with results published previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details of archaeological samples analysed previously, and relevant bibliographic references, can be found in our previous publication [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The FTIR spectra obtained for the different samples allow us to confirm that, in all cases, the raw material used is amber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, they present significantly different patterns, which allow us to note the use of amber with different origins, and exposed to different postdepositional conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least three different geological sources can be identified, which are discussed in turn:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Iberian_origin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The only object for which we can propose a peninsular source is the bead from La Velilla (Palencia), the archaeological site with amber that is closest to some of the Iberias geological amber deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, we can see that both the spectrum of the bead and the characteristic spectra of Cretaceous Iberian amber display similar patterns in the diagnostic area of the spectrum (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  c. 1600900 cm-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amber spectrum from La Velilla is characterised by five well-defined bands: at 1570 ±5 cm-1 by the aromatic double bonds C = C, at 1457 ±5 and 1381 ±5 cm-1 attributable to alkyl groups, the first the -CH2 and -CH3 flexures (bending, ) and the second due only to the -CH3 flexure; a band at 1158 ±5 cm-1 which can be attributed to the tension of the C-O simple ester bond, and one last band at 1034 ±5 cm-1 as well as three secondary peaks at 1411 ±5, 1277 ±5 and 1230 ±5 cm-1 (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [55]) (Fig 10; Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This spectrum is similar to the reference spectrum of the Cretaceous Peninsular amber described above, which is characterised by bands at 1457, 1376, 1155, and 1030 ±5 cm-1 as well as a secondary peak at 1226 ±5 cm-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most significant differences in the spectra are the band at 1570 ±5 cm-1 and the secondary peak at 1411 ±5 cm-1 in the sample from La Velilla, which do not appear in the geological samples, and may be due to oxidation processes (as seen in other samples taken from the weathered layers of amber; see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the spectrum from La Velilla sample is almost identical to the archaeological amber samples from the Palaeolithic settings of La Garma A [57], for which a local origin, the Cretaceous amber of the North of the Iberian Peninsula, was proposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can also therefore propose that this archaeological amber has an Iberian origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The new results presented in this article provide a stronger basis to confirm and expand the diachronic perspective of changes in the provision and exchange of amber in the Iberian Peninsula from the Late Palaeolithic period to the Late Bronze Age [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the Late Palaeolithic, amber consumption is already well documented, although its distribution is constrained to the Northern part of Iberia and the origin of the raw material is local in all cases (Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the rest of the Peninsula, amber objects only begin to appear in the 5th4th Millennia BC, especially in the South and West, concurrently with the arrival of exogenous amber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now have analytical support for this phenomenon in the samples from Chousa Nova, Mamoa V of Chã de Arcas, Dolmen of Alberite, Campo de Hockey, Los Cuarenta Cave and La Velilla [16, 63, 64, 67, 68, this paper].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C = Cretaceous (Iberia); S = Simetite (Sicily); B = Succinite (Baltic).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202235.g017  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of these samples, the beads from the Dolmen of Alberite (6th5th Millennia BC) were the first to be explicitly identified as simetite in several publications [16], and hence purported to be Sicilian in origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, in an interesting article about the origin of amber recovered in Italy, Angelini and Bellintani have questioned the Sicilian origin of the Alberite samples by noting that the original publication shows a totally different spectrum in the fingerprint region from the typical spectrum of simetite [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the shape of the FTIR spectrum shown in a relatively recent publication [16] does superficially resemble that of reference simetite, and it is here that the authors first propose this identification (see also [67]), the location of the absorption bands reported in an earlier publication [65] does not accurately match those in our reference simetite sample (see Table 5), and hence a Sicilian origin is possible but not conclusively proved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In any case, FTIR spectra matching those of simetite have also been published in the studies of the Mamoa V of Chã de Arcas and Chousa Nova (5th Millennium BC) [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter study has also been questioned by Angelini and Bellintani [69] because of the presence of an absorption peak at around 1000 cm-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is true that the peak to which they refer appears displaced (at 1019 cm-1 instead of 1041 ±5cm-1 as it is in the reference spectra of simetite), all the bands described coincide with those of simetite (Table 5), and it therefore seems sensible to retain this assignation as the most plausible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Angelini and Bellintani [69] also cast doubts on the Sicilian origin of the amber pommel of the structure 1004210049 of Valencina de la Concepción published in Murillo-Barroso and Martinón-Torres [9], because of the presence of two absorption peaks around 1000 and 888 cm-1, although they recognise that a Sicilian origin is still plausible in this case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first peak they refer to is actually at 1045 (simetite = 1041 ±5 cm-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second peak (887cm-1) cannot be considered a marker of provenance but of postdepositional alteration since, as noted above, this band disappears following thermal exposure [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Other deposits of Late Neolithic chronology and bearing amber include the Campo de Hockey analyses (transition 5th4th Millennia BC); the results of these analyses have not been published, although it has been confirmed that the amber is not Baltic succinite [67].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have the samples from Los Cuarenta Cave [63] and La Velilla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted above, the (degraded) samples from Los Cuarenta Cave yielded identical spectra to the weathered layers analysed in other amber objects from the 4th3rd Millennia BC, such as those from the tholos of Montelirio or the artificial cave of Sao Paulo, whose unaltered cores also give the same spectrum as Sicilian simetite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore propose that those samples constitute degraded simetite [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regarding the interior part of the Peninsula, the earliest data concerning the presence of amber in the Northern Plateau (La Velilla) points to an Iberian source and thus confirms the strength of regional networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of regional raw materials in the North Peninsular area continued until the 2nd Millennium BC, as demonstrated by the amber beads from Los Lagos I [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The use of these local resources, however, is not documented in the Southern part of the Iberian Peninsula.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outside the Northern region, where geological amber deposits are abundant, the amber objects analysed are, in all cases, foreign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This preference for exogenous raw materials could respond to different causes that are not mutually exclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a technological point of view, the greater age of Iberian amber makes it more fragile and therefore more difficult to carve than succinite or Cenozoic simetite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a more social perspective, it is worth considering that amber objects may have arrived in Iberia already manufactured; in this case, the choice of foreign objects would be driven not so much (or not just) by the quality of the material, but by the role played by these amber objects in establishing social relations or alliances through exchange or gift policies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This presence of foreign amber materialises in a much more evident way during the 3rd Millennium BC [9, 70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in foreign amber is noticeable not so much in the size of the assemblages (the 250 beads from the tholos of Montelirio in Valencina de la Concepción being an exception to the general trend of only a few beads per deposit), as in the number of sites containing amber, which practically doubles compared to the previous period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of Sicilian simetite is confirmed in 3rd Millennium BC contexts for the objects from Valencina de la Concepción and those from the artificial cave of Sao Paulo, Valle de las Higueras, Llano de la Teja 18 and Los Millares.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the South Plateau, the necropolis of Valle de las Higueras is an exception because of the presence of amber associated to Bell Beaker, something not found in the areas hypogea [71], nor in those of the North Plateau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Valle de las Higueras points to a mixed situation where the variscite comes from an Iberian source in Zamora, the Trivia arctica is from the Atlantic and the amber from Sicily, an image that is fairly coherent with the central location of this necropolis in the Iberian Peninsula.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, while the sites in the North of the Iberian Peninsula show continuity and the survival of the local networks of exchange, the identification of Sicilian amber in Andalusia demonstrates the beginning of Mediterranean exchange circuits dating back to the 4th Millennium BC at least; in parallel, the presence of variscite from the Iberian West in the megaliths of Luffang (North-West France) dated to the 4th Millennium BC [7] confirms the existence of Atlantic exchange routes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of the South in the intensification of social and economic complexity of the 3rd Millennium BC is notable and reflected in the greater participation of this region in trans-regional circuits of exchange, as manifest in the fact that all the sites with more abundant amber and other exotic objects are located in this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus we can confirm the presence of simetite in the Iberian Peninsula as early as the 4th Millennium BC, and possibly earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the first amber objects recovered in Sicily and assigned a local origin also date from the 4th Millennium BC [69, 72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is no other evidence that might indicate direct contact between Sicily and Iberia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we do know about the links between the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa, and the fact that present-day Tunisia was involved in Central Mediterranean exchange networks of obsidian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The island of Pantelleria, situated between the shores of Tunisia and Sicily, appears to have been the main source of obsidian for North Africa, Tunisia, Sicily and Italy [2, 3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though no obsidian artefacts are known in Southern Iberia, it seems plausible that Sicilian amber reached the Iberian Peninsula indirectly through exchanges with North Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the spatial distribution of amber findings from the 4th and 3rd Millennia BC is similar to that of ivory objects [73], which could suggest that both materials reached the Iberian Peninsula following the same or similar channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The steady increase in amber consumption we had been observing since the 5th Millennium BC seems to be interrupted abruptly in the 2nd Millennium BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of very late examples addressed below, there are only a few contexts from the 2ndMillennium BC in which amber is documented, and these are more or less restricted to the North-Eastern part of Iberia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is in this period, however, when we first document Baltic succinite, which from then on will become virtually the only raw material used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar situation, namely simetite being the only type of amber deposited, has been described for Italy and Sicily from the Eneolitic to the Middle Bronze Age [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted, however, that Baltic amber is first documented in Sicily slightly earlier (16001300 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC) than in Iberia; furthermore, in contrast with Iberia, the frequency of amber is prominent in the Eastern and Central Mediterranean during the 2nd Millennium BC (especially in the Mycenaean Culture and the Peloponnese), although most of the objects, especially in Early Mycenaean contexts, are concentrated in a few of the richest graves [7476].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sicilian simetite continues to be used in Eastern and Central Mediterranean, even if with less intensity, as evidenced by the 2nd Millennium BC samples from Greece analysed by Beck and Hartnett [66] and the sample from Madonna del Piano (Catania, Sicily) dated to the 10th century BC [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most of the amber documented in Greece and Italy during the second half of the 2nd Millennium BC is Baltic in origin, evidencing connections between Nordic/Atlantic Europe and the Mediterranean (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7577]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unfortunately, the lack of absolute dates in the Bronze Age settings of the North-East part of the Iberian Peninsula where amber is documented prevents us from accurately pinpointing the moment when succinite begins to reach Iberia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The earliest known evidence of Baltic amber may be that of the Dolmen of Larrarte (Guipúzcoa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Published dates for this site range between 53454051 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC and 42363542 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC [78].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these dates were obtained from charcoal samples collected outside the chamber, as human remains did not have sufficient collagen for dating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific context where amber was recovered remains undated although the grave goods recovered are characteristic of the Copper Age: Bell Beaker pottery, lithics and several beads including green and amber beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this particular case, the supra-regional Bell Beaker network may have facilitated the acquisition of amber; however, we should emphasise that on the basis of the current evidence we cannot confirm a direct association between Bell Beaker phenomenon and Baltic amber in Iberia: out of 35 archaeological sites of this chronology with amber objects, only 11 yielded Bell Beaker pottery, and up to now, FTIR analyses have only been conducted on 3 of these sites: Larrarte (Baltic), Trikuaizti I (local) and Valle de las Higueras (Sicilian).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A systematic analysis of the remaining sites is necessary to investigate the possible significance of this network for the early arrival of Baltic amber to Iberia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the Iberian North-East, Baltic amber has been documented in Pedra Cabana, Cabana del Moro de Colomera and Muricecs [9, 24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we lack absolute dates from these contexts, Rovira i Port [24] considers that Pedra Cabana and Cabana del Moro de Colomera should be dated to the advanced Middle Bronze Age (c. 15001300 BC) on the basis of artefacts types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Muricecs deposit, also based on metal objects typology, has been tentatively dated to around 14001200 BC [79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the South-East, we have the samples from Llano de la Sabina 97 and 99, recovered in megalithic monuments with evidence of reuse, with mixed materials from both the 3rd and the 2nd Millennia BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Archaeologically it is impossible to assign the pieces of amber to any particular chronology but their Baltic origin suggests that they correspond to the later reutilisations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample from Llano de la Teja 18, another monument with evidence of reuse, raises more doubts, as the FTIR spectrum for the amber is consistent with Sicilian simetite and hence would suggest a 3rd Millennium BC chronology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge, however, the risks of circularity in our argument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The decline in amber consumption during the 2nd Millennium BC is more significant when placed against the backdrop of other changes: during the 4th and 3rd Millennia BC, amber had been closely linked to megalithic monuments of undeniable symbolic significance, and often accompanied by other special raw materials such as ostrich eggs, ivory, cinnabar or gold; all of these exotic raw materials appear to vanish concurrently [80].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This radical change in the material repertoire may have responded to the need of new ideological and symbolic standards to legitimise the new social orders characteristic of Bronze Age societies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symbolic expressions of the Chalcolithic period are left behind, and new codes are established where amber no longer plays an important role and is replaced, with increasing frequency, by metal objects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The examples we have observed of tholoi reuse, as in Llano de la Sabina 97 and 99, could well be framed as a response or resistance to the new ideological order and the survival of ancestral traditions (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [81]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar transformations of materiality reflecting ideological changes have also been proposed for Mycenaean Greece where, contrary to Iberia, amber would have played a major role: firstly in the construction of Early Mycenaean warrior identity (c. 17001420 BC), to acquire later a cosmological significance during the Mycenaean post-palatial period (c. 12001060 BC) [74].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although now with a Baltic origin (simetite is not documented again in subsequent chronologies), amber will reappear in Iberia in the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age (Fig 17), when Mediterranean contacts again have an important impact on the societies of the Peninsula, as reflected at the sites of Quinta do Marcelo (12th-8th centuries BC), Moreirinha (13rd-9th centuries BC) and Senhora da Guia (10th-8thcenturies BC) in Portugal [this paper, 68] or Palacio III (11st-6th centuries BC) and Herrerías II (10th century BC) in Spain [23, 82].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dating the resurgence of the use of amber in Iberia, and particularly the onset of Baltic amber, is particularly important in the light of claims that Scandinavian trader-raiders engaged directly in exchange with Iberian communities to obtain metals, and that amber was the material supplied in return [8385].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, contextual associations are as important as dates: amber exchange cannot be studied in isolation, and Baltic provenance does not necessarily imply direct contact with the Nordic region, especially when we bear in mind that Baltic amber is also documented in Central and Eastern Mediterranean in this period and Mediterranean metals are documented in the Nordic region as well [77, 86].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It must be highlighted that the spatial distribution of amber objects from 12th century BC is concentrated close to coastal sites, and the earliest evidence of Baltic succinite in Southern and Western Iberia occurs in association with some of the earliest iron objects, and is hence connected to a technology that likely arrived via the Mediterranean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the case of Quinta do Marcelo, Moreirinha, Senhora da Guía and Palacio III.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, there are other objects which point to Mediterranean pre-colonial contacts: metal artefacts recovered at Quinta do Marcelo have been related to the Mediterranean [52]; bronze wheeled stands from Senhora da Guía are unequivocally linked to the Mediterranean, with Syrian-Cypriot or Sardinian style [87]; and silver objects from Palacio III do also correspond to Mediterranean traditions [82].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these materials must be contextualised in a period of Mediterranean contacts previous to the Phoenician colonisation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the earliest examples of these contacts are the Mycenaean pottery recovered at Llanete de los Moros (Córdoba) dated to the 14th-13th centuries BC or the wheeled and Cogotas I pottery from Cuesta del Negro (Granada) dated to the 14th century BC, also with a proposed Mycenaean origin (see Torres Ortiz [88] for discussion of absolute dates of early pre-colonial contacts, and Celestino et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [89] for general discussion on Mediterranean pre-colonial contacts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the North-Eastern Iberian region, continental contacts through the Pyrenees continued during the Bronze Age (as evidenced by the Muricecs deposit of Baltic amber) as well as Mediterranean ones, although the latter being seemingly less important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This panorama will change during the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age, when Mediterranean contacts become more intense [90].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the current evidence, it would seem that Baltic amber only reaches Southern Iberia in any significant amounts towards the very end of the 2nd Millennium BC, in a phenomenon that is usually connected with Mediterranean rather than Atlantic networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The new evidence presented in this paper, brought together with information published previously, has allowed the most comprehensive review to date on the provision and exchange of amber in the Prehistory of Iberia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several conclusions and priorities for future work can be highlighted:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The new results thus fill some of the research gaps highlighted in our 2012 publication [9], while they extend the empirical base that allows us to infer the diachronic changes that took place in the amber exchange circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This panorama, however, leaves some unresolved issues that should be investigated in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of them is the possible presence of amber in North African contexts from the 5th3rd Millennia BC and its archaeometric characterisation, not least considering the possible involvement of this region in the Mediterranean exchange network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relatedly, a systematic exploration of North African amber resources should be warranted; there are currently no known geological deposits of amber in North Africa, except for a locality with amber in Tunisia that remains to be confirmed [91].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another major priority in the research agenda is the need for further chronological precision to trace the introduction and spread of Baltic succinite in Iberia, the networks that made this possible, and the extent to which metals or other Iberian commodities were provided in return.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
