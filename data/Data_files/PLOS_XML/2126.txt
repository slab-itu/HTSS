Hidden species diversity in Sylvirana nigrovittata (Amphibia: Ranidae) highlights the importance of taxonomic revisions in biodiversity conservation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Accurately delimiting species and their geographic ranges is imperative for conservation, especially in areas experiencing rapid habitat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Southeast Asia currently has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, is home to multiple biodiversity hotspots, and the majority of its countries have developing economies with limited resources for biodiversity conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, accurately delimiting species and their ranges is particularly important in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined genetic and morphological variation in the widespread frog species Sylvirana nigrovittata (and its long-treated junior synonym S. mortenseni) with the goal of clarifying its taxonomic content and geographic range boundaries for conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present evidence that the current concept of S. nigrovittata contains at least eight species, two of which are each known from only two localities, but that S. mortenseni is more geographically widespread than currently realized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five of these species are described as new to science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Accurately delimiting species is essential for effective conservation of biodiversity [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not possible to assess the biodiversity conservation status of a given area without knowing which species it contains and how geographically widespread those species are.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite increased attention on habitats and ecosystems [24], individual species remain the primary units of conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Funding agencies and government policy continue to focus on species rather than habitats, and therefore accurate understanding of species distributions is imperative for informing conservation policy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The worlds biodiversity hotspots are concentrated in the tropics [5], where large numbers of undescribed species, including undetected cryptic species, remain unrecognized [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cryptic species are two or more distinct species that are erroneously classified (= hidden) under a single species name [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cryptic species are taxonomically widespread, found throughout the animal kingdom [911], and represented by both terrestrial and aquatic organisms [12, 13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such cryptic species pose challenges to taxonomists and conservation managers alike.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a taxonomists perspective, it can be difficult to diagnose species that exhibit minimal morphological divergence, and non-visual traits such as genetics or vocalizations (usually unavailable from historical specimens) often become the primary means of distinguishing among members of these complexes [8, 14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a conservation managers perspective, a lack of clarity on diversity and distributions often requires that cryptic species be lumped as their single nominate species during threat assessments, thus down-grading the acute conservation needs of individual cryptic species [8, 15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Amphibians have increasingly been shown to harbor cryptic species diversity [7, 8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that amphibians are considered to be the worlds most threatened vertebrate group [16], it is essential to assess the extent of cryptic diversity in this group in order to prioritize conservation actions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Southeast Asia is a biodiversity hotspot [5] that simultaneously is experiencing the highest deforestation rate of all major tropical rainforest areas [17, 18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that large numbers of amphibian species are threatened by habitat loss, and that species with restricted geographic ranges are especially at risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even amphibian species that are commonly found in human-modified habitats (e.g., the four-lined tree-frog [Polypedates leucomystax], the Asian common toad [Duttaphrynus melanostictus], the grass frog [Fejervarya limnocharis]) are now known or suspected to represent complexes of cryptic species [1921].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sylvirana nigrovittata (Blyth 1856) is a notable example of a Southeast Asian frog species that has long been suspected to be hiding cryptic species diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of this species (or its species complex) have a pale brown to dark brown dorsum; flank generally darker than dorsum; dorsolateral folds, with a black band (sometimes broken) of variable width extending from the tip of the snout to the groin along the lower margin of the dorsolateral fold; cream venter, sometimes with dark spotting; humeral glands in adult males; visible tympanum; and the upper one-third of the iris lighter in coloration than the lower two-thirds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Originally described from Myanmar, this species is currently recognized as having a wide geographic range in mainland Southeast Asia that extends from northeastern India to Peninsular Malaysia [22, 23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smith [24] provided evidence that S. nigrovittata is distinguishable from, but closely related to, S. mortenseni [25], a species described from Thailand and Myanmar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following year, Smith [26] reversed his assessment and synonymized the two species, treating S. mortenseni as only a geographical variant of S. nigrovittata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Smith [26] recognized two additional, unnamed geographical variants of S. nigrovittata, one from peninsular Thailand and one from northeastern Thailand and Laos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of allozymic variation in samples of S. nigrovittata from across Thailand recovered two major genetic groups, one of which contained topotypic samples of S. mortenseni and therein justified its synonymy with S. nigrovittata [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ohler et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [28] removed S. mortenseni from the synonymy of S. nigrovittata on the basis of morphology, extended the range of S. mortensensi into mainland Cambodia and northeastern Thailand, and cited unpublished morphological data that suggested the presence of as many as five distinct species within the S. nigrovittata complex in Thailand and Indochina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oliver et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [29] found that six samples from Vietnam and Myanmar that morphologically resembled S. nigrovittata failed to form a monophyletic group within the genus in molecular phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly a century of observation on morphological variation, and recent molecular analyses, together provide compelling evidence that S. nigrovittata harbors cryptic species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to date no comprehensive analysis of variation across the range of S. nigrovittata (herein including S. mortenseni) has been conducted, but such an analysis is required to resolve this long-standing taxonomic uncertainty [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generic status of S. nigrovittata has been in flux [29], but we follow Frost et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [31] and Oliver et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [29] in recognizing Sylvirana Dubois, 1992 at the genus rank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Herein, we present such an analysis of morphological and genetic variation (representing loci from both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes) in samples of S. nigrovittata obtained from across mainland Southeast Asia that represent most of its currently recognized geographic range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We seek corroborated evidence from these multiple, independent datasets that S. nigrovittata consists of more than one distinct evolutionary lineage (= species).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further use these findings to clarify the taxonomy and geographic ranges of these species in an effort to facilitate a revised evaluation of the conservation needs of each contained species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sampling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specimens were collected in the field by the authors during 19982013, temporarily housed in individual plastic bags, humanely euthanized using immersion in tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222; [32]), and fixed in 10% buffered formalin after preserving liver in 20% DMSO-salt saturated storage buffer, 95% ethanol, or RNAlater (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens were later transferred to 70% ethanol for permanent storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens and tissue samples were deposited at the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH), the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCSM), and the Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science, National University of Laos (NUOL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens and tissues were also borrowed from the holdings of these and other institutions (S1 & S2 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_extraction__amplification__and_sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole genomic DNA was extracted from 349 liver or muscle samples (S1 Table) using the 5Prime ArchivePure DNA Cell/Tissue Kit (5Prime).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 467 bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that encodes part of the cytochrome oxidase c subunit III (COXIII) gene, the complete tRNA glycine (Gly), the complete NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) gene, and part of the tRNA arginine (Arg), a 596606 bp fragment of mtDNA that encodes part of the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S) gene, and a 1,0581,084 bp fragment of mtDNA that encodes part of the tRNA methionine (Met), the complete NADH deydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) gene, and part of the tRNA tryptophan (Trp) gene were amplified by PCR (the polymerase chain reaction) following Stuart et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 607613 bp fragment of nuclear DNA (nuDNA) that encodes part of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene was amplified by PCR (94Â°C 45s, 57Â°C 30s, 72Â°C 1 min) for 35 cycles using the primer pair POMC-1 and POMC-2 [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 9961,002 bp fragment of nuDNA that encodes part of the sodium/calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1) gene was amplified by PCR (94Â°C 45s, 53Â°C 30s, 72Â°C 1 min) for 35 cycles using the primer pair NCX_1F and NCX_3R [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR products were cleaned using GELase (Epicentre Technologies) or ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix), and sequenced in both directions by direct double strand cycle sequencing using Big Dye version 3 chemistry (Perkin Elmer) and the amplifying primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were edited using Sequencher v. 4.1 (Genecodes) and deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MG605710MG607352 (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Homologous sequences of the outgroup taxa Babina holsti, Pelophylax nigromaculatus, Hydrophylax leptoglossa, Hylarana erythraea, Indosylvirana attigua, Sylvirana cubitalis, and S. maosonensis [following 29, 35, 36] were downloaded from GenBank (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These and the newly generated sequences were aligned using default settings in MAFFT [37], followed by visual verification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alignments were partitioned by gene and by codon position (if relevant), and concatenated mtDNA and concatenated nuDNA datasets were analyzed separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mixed-model Bayesian phylogenetic inference was performed using MrBayes 3.2.6 [38] on the Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research (CIPRES) Science Gate Way 3.3 [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best partitioning scheme, and best-fitting model of sequence evolution for each partition that is available for implementation in MrBayes 3.2.6, were selected using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) in PartitionFinder 1.1.0 [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The six selected partitions and models in the mtDNA dataset were GTR+I+ for COXIII third codon position, Met, and ND2 first codon position; GTR+ for COXIII first codon position, ND2 second codon position, and ND3 second codon position; JC for COXIII second codon position; GTR+I+ for 16S, Gly, ND3 first codon position, and Trp; GTR+I+ for ND2 third codon position and ND3 third codon position; and K80 for Arg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three selected partitions and models in the nuDNA dataset were SYM+I+ for NCX and POMC third codon positions; HKY+I+ for NCX and POMC first codon positions; and F81 for NCX and POMC second codon positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four independent Bayesian runs were performed on each dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the mtDNA dataset, four chains ran for 10,000,000 generations using the default priors, the chain temperature was set to 0.1, trees were sampled every 2,000 generations, and the first 25% of trees were discarded as burn in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the nuDNA dataset, four chains ran for 30,000,000 generations using the default priors, the chain temperature was set to 0.1, trees were sampled every 3,000 generations, and the first 50% of trees were discarded as burn in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trace plots were viewed using Tracer 1.6 [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An unrooted phylogenetic network of the concatenated nuDNA dataset was constructed using SplitsTree v4.14.4 [42] with uncorrected p genetic distances and the NeighborNet algorithm to visualize overall divergence patterns while accounting for reticulate (non-branching) relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only samples having both POMC and NCX sequence data were included in the phylogenetic network analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Morphological_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Only sexually mature individuals were used in the morphological analyses, as determined by the presence of secondary sexual characteristics (vocal sac openings, nuptial pads, and/or humeral glands in males, and convoluted oviducts or mature ova in females).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphometric data were taken only by the first author to minimize inter-observer bias [43, 44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twelve measurements were taken using Mitutoyo digital calipers, to the nearest 0.1 mm under a Meiji EMZ dissecting microscope: snout-vent length (SVL), head length from tip of snout to rear of jaws (HDL), maximum head width (HDW), snout length from tip of snout to anterior corner of eye (SNT), eye diameter (EYE), interorbital distance (IOD), internasal distance (IND), horizontal diameter of tympanum (TMP), shank length (SHK), thigh length (TGH), manus length from tip of third digit to base of outer palmar tubercle (HND), and pes length from tip of fourth toe to base of inner metatarsal tubercle (FTL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manus length (HND) and FTL were measured on the left side of the body, and all remaining measurements were taken from the right side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toe disc and phalanx width were also measured in holotypes and these measurements are reported to the nearest 0.01 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reported errors around means are standard deviations (SD; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw morphological data are given in S1 Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measurements used in discriminant function analysis (DFA) were corrected for differences in ontogenetic composition [45] using the following allometric equation: Xadj = X (SVLSVLmean), where Xadj is the adjusted value of the morphometric variable and X is the original value; SVLmean is the overall mean SVL for a given clade,  is the within-clade coefficient of the linear regression of X against SVL [46, 47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFA was performed on Xadj and SVL values using JMP Pro 9 [48] to determine whether the nominate species overlap in morphospace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were assigned to species in the DFA based on their assignment in the mtDNA Bayesian analysis (below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFA was performed only for putative species that had measurement and sequence data for at least three individuals per sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, DFA was performed on males of all species but only females of S. nigrovittata, S. mortenseni, S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., and S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phylogenetic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The aligned mtDNA dataset contained 2,183 characters of 351 taxa (344 individuals of the S. nigrovittata complex), and the aligned nuDNA dataset contained 1,617 characters of 342 taxa (335 individuals of the S. nigrovittata complex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standard deviation of split frequencies among the four Bayesian runs was 0.007004 in the mtDNA analysis and 0.031448 in the nuDNA analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective sample sizes (ESS) obtained in Tracer [41] was  509 in the mtDNA analysis and  374 in the nuDNA analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mtDNA Bayesian analysis found strong support for the monophyly of Sylvirana (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples of the S. nigrovittata complex were recovered in at least eight major mtDNA clades, but samples referred to this complex from Chin and Mandalay States, Myanmar, rendered the complex non-monophyletic with respect to S. cubitalis and S. maosonensis (Figs 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nuDNA Bayesian analysis also found strong support for the monophyly of Sylvirana and the non-monophyly of the S. nigrovittata complex with respect to to S. cubitalis and S. maosonensis owing to the same samples from Chin and Mandalay States, Myanmar (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the nuDNA Bayesian analysis revealed much less limited genetic structure among samples of the S. nigrovittata complex, with only four of the eight major mtDNA clades also recovered in the nuDNA Bayesian analysis (those referred to below as S. faber, S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., and S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.; Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unrooted phylogenetic network of the nuDNA data (Fig 6) revealed more genetic structure than did the nuDNA Bayesian analysis, with considerable admixture between two mtDNA lineages (those referred to as S. mortensensi and S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., below), minimal admixture of two additional mtDNA lineages (those referred to as S. nigrovittata and S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., below), and no admixture of the four lineages that were also reciprocally monophyletic in the Bayesian mtDNA and nuDNA analyses (those referred to below as S. faber, S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., and S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Morphological_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, DFA of males correctly assigned 85% of specimens to their species (based on mtDNA clades), with correct classifications of species ranging from 69100% (Table 2; Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males of S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (below) were very distinct in morphospace (100% correct classification rates), but males of remaining species overlapped in morphospace with at least one other species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While S. mortenseni slightly overlapped with S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (below), S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (below) strongly overlapped with S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (below), and S. nigrovittata strongly overlapped with S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (below) (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, DFA of females (only five species analyzed) correctly assigned 95% of specimens to their mtDNA clade (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. and S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (below) were correctly classified 100% of the time, S. mortenseni and S. nigrovittata were correctly classified 94% of the time, and S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (below) was correctly classified 86% of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Species_accounts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We follow Inger et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [49] in adopting a conservative operational criterion of recognizing as species only those lineages that are diagnosable in more than one independent dataset, in this case, in morphology, mtDNA and/or nuDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this operational criterion, herein we recognize eight distinct species in the S. nigrovittata complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include S. nigrovittata, S. mortenseni, S. faber, and five previously unnamed species, as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present evidence to reject the hypothesis that frogs that morphologically resemble S. nigrovittata should continue to be recognized as a single species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we hypothesize that these frogs represent a minimum of eight distinct evolutionary lineages that should be recognized as species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our evidence for their recognition as species is based on three independent lines of evidence, morphology (both qualitative and quantitative measures of phenotype), mtDNA, and/or nuDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondrial DNA divergence provided us with a framework for initially partitioning up this complex, and those mitochondrial lineages corroborated by morphological or nuDNA divergence were recognized and named herein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous subclades of mtDNA (Figs 14) were not recognized herein as species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three previously named species (S. nigrovittata, S. mortenseni, and S. faber) and two newly-named species (S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. and S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.) were readily distinguishable using the data that were available to us.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of the newly named species (S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., and S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.) were less readily distinguishable from S. nigrovittata and S. mortenseni, but sufficient evidence existed in our view to support the hypothesis that these three also represented distinct species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These three named taxa may be less easily diagnosed because they are younger evolutionary lineages, or incipient species, that continue to share ancestral polymorphisms in nuDNA and morphology with S. nigrovittata or S. mortenseni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We emphasize that our recognized eight species are hypotheses that remain testable with new data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finer-scale, denser sampling at the geographic boundaries of the proposed species, accompanied by the use of multi-locus data sets to delimit species using coalescent-based methods such as *BEAST [68] or Bayesian Phylogenetics & Phylogeography [69], should be employed to further test these hypotheses of species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acoustic data, such as advertisement calls of males, should also be compared at these species boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of more than one species in at least partial sympatry (central Laos) and syntopy (southwestern Cambodia) suggests that isolating mechanisms between at least some of these species probably exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of acoustic variation, and other parameters such as timing of reproduction, mode of reproduction, and microhabitat use of different life stages (larvae and adults) may provide important insight into these isolating mechanisms and further clarify species boundaries in this group of frogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not study larvae in this group, as we lacked sufficient material, and previously published descriptions of larvae from across the geographic range of the species complex have found great similarities in larval shape, size, coloration, and oral characters among populations [30, 66, 70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this study should provide a framework for new, targeted sampling of larvae, with identifications verified with DNA barcoding methods [e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30], that are then studied using tools such as scanning electron microscopy of the buccopharyngeal morphology, a method that has been shown to be useful in revealing differences in larval characters of otherwise morphologically cryptic species [71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The S. nigrovittata complex is taxonomically challenging and ripe with morphologically cryptic species that are difficult to tease apart; for these reasons, S. nigrovittata has been recognized as being polytypic for nearly a century, but without formal description of much of this variation [24, 2630, 72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our findings are largely consistent with those of others, although the interpretations of the same variation across the range of S. nigrovittata may differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smith [26] noted three distinct morphotypes within Thailand, and these largely agree with our hypotheses of at least three species occurring in the country (S. nigrovittata, S. mortenseni, and S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matsui et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [27], using allozymic data, found that populations of S. mortenseni at Koh Chang, Thailand (its type locality) and S. nigrovittata at Phu Wua in northeastern Thailand formed a group that was separate from populations at Phu Luang and elsewhere in northern Thailand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They used these findings to justify treating S. mortenseni as a junior synomym of S. nigrovittata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found the same general pattern of genetic (and morphological) variation, but instead expanded the range of S. mortenseni into northeastern Thailand [as did 28], and assigned samples from Phu Luang (and elsewhere in northern Thailand) to S. nigrovittata sensu stricto.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gawor et al.s [30] recovery of distinct mitochondrial DNA clades in central Vietnam and northern Thailand is also corroborated in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the most compelling justifications for rejecting the hypothesis that S. nigrovittata contains a single species is the non-monophyly of frogs that morphologically resemble S. nigrovittata to other species of Sylvirana [29, this study].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate improved communication, we recommend modifying the concept of the S. nigrovittata complex from that employed at the start of our study [and that by 29] to one that reflects only those lineages that form a monophyletic group with the nominate form, S. nigrovittata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we recommend not continuing to treat S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. as a member of the S. nigrovittata complex, despite the general similarity in its morphology that led to its inclusion in our initial study and that by Oliver et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our hypotheses of species in this complex are likely an underestimate, as anecdotal evidence suggests the high likelihood of additional, unstudied diversity in the group, notably in Myanmar and Sumatra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boulengers [73] syntypes of S. mortenseni from Koh Chang, Thailand, and Mon, Myanmar, were examined by us and cursorily determined to represent two morphologically distinct species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The designation of a lectotype herein from Koh Chang assigns the form from that locality to the name S. mortensensi, but we chose to not include the Mon specimens in our study (or to assign them a name) owing to the unavailability of genetic material from Mon or its vicinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a single specimen of S. nigrovittata from off of the mainland of Southeast Asia, in Sumatra, Indonesia, was cursorily examined by us (FMNH 210049), but was also not included in this study owing to lack of accompanying genetic material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, two species in this complex from southern China that were recently named as new species without genetic evidence, S. menglaensis and S. hekouensis (Fei, Ye & Xie, 2008; Fei, Ye & Jiang, 2008) were synonymized by us with S. nigrovittata on the basis of samples available to us from nearby localities in Laos and Vietnam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these synonymies should be verified with additional sampling at, or much closer to, their type localities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further sampling in Myanmar, Sumatra, and southern China, and study of the resulting collections, may reveal additional diversity and/or help to clarify species boundaries in this group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While S. nigrovittata sensu stricto remains geographically widespread in our study, the other members of this group have considerably smaller geographic ranges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana nigrovittata is currently listed as a species of global Least Concern [23], in part due to its wide geographic range [74].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, S. mortenseni and the five species newly described here need a reassessment of their conservation status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. and S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., are currently known only from two localities each and so may have acute conservation needs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, S. mortenseni was listed as Near Threatened [23] based on having a known geographic range of only Koh Chang Island, Thailand, and the adjacent Cardamom Mountains of Cambodia at the time of the assessment [75].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provided evidence that the geographic distribution of this species is much larger than previously realized (Fig 11; and see [28]), and thus S. mortenseni could warrant a downgrade in its conservation assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of size of geographic range, all species here suffer habitat loss, as deforestation rates in Southeast Asia continue to be among the highest globally [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The threat of habitat loss is particularly acute for those species having known narrow geographic distributions (e.g., Sylvirana lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., and S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This underscores the importance of properly delimiting species in complexes of cryptic taxa, as well as their geographic ranges, in order to accurately assess conservation priorities within countries and across the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
