The role of microbial amyloid in neurodegeneration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has become apparent that the intestinal microbiota orchestrates important aspects of our metabolism, immunity, and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work has demonstrated that the microbiota also influences brain function in healthy and diseased individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of great interest are reports that intestinal bacteria play a role in the pathogenic cascade of both Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These neurodegenerative disorders both involve misfolding of endogenous proteins that spreads from one region of the body to another in a manner analogous to prions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms of how the microbiota influences or is correlated with disease require elaboration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbial proteins or metabolites may influence neurodegeneration through the promotion of amyloid formation by human proteins or by enhancing inflammatory responses to endogenous neuronal amyloids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We review the current knowledge concerning bacterial amyloids and their potential to influence cerebral amyloid aggregation and neuroinflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose the term mapranosis to describe the process of microbiota-associated proteopathy and neuroinflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study of amyloid proteins made by the microbiota and their influence on health and disease is in its infancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a promising area for therapeutic intervention because there are many ways to alter our microbial partners and their products, including amyloid proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Microbial amyloid can engage TLRs on the epithelial surface and prime systemic inflammation through the lymph follicles (Peyer patches) linked to M cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This priming of the innate immune system via a hematogenous route may cause enhanced response to neuronal amyloids in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbial amyloid may also increase production of neuronal amyloids (such as alpha-synuclein) though the neural connections of the enteroendocrine cells as well as the other epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuronal amyloid accumulation may be enhanced by exposure to microbial amyloid through increased expression and through cross-seeding, leading to misfolding of neuronal proteins in the brain, in a manner analogous to kuru and bovine spongiform encephalopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The submucosal and myenteric plexuses are shown as a single structure for simplicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TLRs, toll-like receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Microbial amyloid may effect changes in protein folding and neuroinflammation in the CNS through the autonomic nervous system (particularly the vagus nerve), the trigeminal nerve in the mouth and nasopharynx, and the gut (including mouth, esophagus, stomach and intestines), as well as via the olfactory receptors in the roof of the nose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CNS, central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

1_The_microbiota_modulates_immunological_processes_in_the_CNS_[9__48]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gut bacteria have been shown to influence microglia in the brain [55], and it has been suggested that the microbiota in Parkinson disease is linked to a higher potential for inflammation [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of interest is the observation that bacterial amyloid is recognized by the innate immune system as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern [56, 57], with a response involving TLRs 2 and 1, cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFB), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathway of immune response is also involved in the recognition of misfolded alpha-synuclein or Aß [58, 59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased expression of TLRs 2 and 4 has been reported on peripheral blood mononuclear cells in Alzheimer disease [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, microglial cell expression of CD14 is involved in Aß clearance [48], and innate immune system activation by bacterial amyloid may alter Aß homeostasis in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been suggested that exposure to bacterial amyloid proteins in the gut may cause priming of the immune system, thereby enhancing immune response to endogenous production of neuronal amyloids in the brain [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proposal was supported by the work of Chen et al., who found that animals exposed to bacteria producing the amyloid protein curli had higher levels of cerebral inflammation, as compared with animals exposed to bacteria without the ability to produce curli [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuroinflammation may be a key element in causing the disease phenotype because many older subjects with cerebral amyloid deposits as evaluated by positron emission tomography or autopsy are not cognitively impaired [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammatory responses to the amyloid deposits in the brain may be influenced by the microbiota, and this influence may be key to producing cerebral dysfunction [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

2_The_microbiota_may_induce_oxidative_toxicity_and_inflammation_that_contribute_to_neurodegeneration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Activation of TLRs 2 and 1 by bacterial amyloid is expected to enhance production of free radicals through pathways involving CD14, NFB, iNOS, and proinflammatory microRNAs [62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curli have been shown to activate iNOS [57, 63] as well as NFB [56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapinski et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  have shown that curli fibers from Salmonella typhimurium bind to CD14, an adaptor molecule for the TLR2-TLR1 complex [64].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The influence of the microbiota on the balance of oxidative and/or reductive processes has only recently begun to be investigated [65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

3_Metabolites_produced_by_the_microbiome_may_be_pathogenic_or_salutogenic_(health_sustaining)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sampson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  proposed a role for short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by bacterial fermentation in production of alpha-synucleinmediated neuroinflammation [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And Unger et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  have found a decrease in the concentrations of fecal SCFA in Parkinson subjects [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work in this area is clearly needed because microbial metabolites, such as SCFAs, may pass the bloodbrain barrier and have been shown to have important influences on systemic immunity [66, 67].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other metabolites that may be of interest include hydrogen sulfide, trimethylamine, neurotransmitters, lipopolysaccharide, bacterial lipoproteins, flagellin, and organic acids [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrogen sulfide can be a free radical donor or scavenger, and trimethylamine has been linked to vascular disease, which is involved in Alzheimer disease as well as other dementias [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are further metabolites that await discovery because less than 20% of the genes of our microbiota have a known specific metabolic function [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

4_There_is_a_complex_interplay_between_the_human_host_and_its_resident_microbiota  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The influence of host genes on the microbiota may involve dietary choices, bile secretion, and mucus barrier composition, as well as immunological pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is now known that genetic influences on the innate as well as the adaptive immune systems and other pathways influence microbial populations [70, 71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultural differences in human populations can also have a profound influence on the microbiota, including birth practices, child-rearing, food preparation, personal hygiene practices, and diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where humans live can influence the composition of the microbiota and thus neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, several investigations have reported that both Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease have a lower age-specific prevalence in Africa and India than in North America or Europe [72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be related to dietary differences, with the higher consumption of vegetables and lower consumption of meat in Africa and India being related to higher levels of fiber intake and production of SCFAs by the microbiota, which enhances the creation of regulatory lymphocytes in the intestine that have anti-inflammatory properties [73].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crucial influence of global patterns of diet on the microbiota has been demonstrated in a novel study of colon cancer [74].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, future studies should strive to look beyond the CNS to comprehend the multifaceted factors responsible for brain disorders associated with aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several other questions are apparent concerning the potential role of microbial amyloids and other products of the microbiota on brain disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Why_are_the_neurodegenerative_disorders_so_closely_related_to_age?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease are known to have a prolonged course extending for decades from the early to the later stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been documented that the oral transmission of prion disease, such as kuru, may involve an incubation period of  greater than 50 years [72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enormous size of internal microbial populations and the slow nature of age-related disease processes provide a great opportunity for both pathogenic and salutogenic processes to occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The late onset of Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease allows for minute alterations in proteostasis and inflammation to have cumulative effects [75].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be that the presence of bacterial amyloids produced by the gut microbiota shortens the time necessary for the development of cerebral amyloids through nucleation of oligomer formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, changes in the immune and gastrointestinal systems with age may enhance the burden of microbial amyloids and alter their influence on immune homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

What_are_the_principal_sources_of_microbial_amyloid_in_humans?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The production of bacterial amyloid proteins by organisms known to be found in the gut are well studied [46, 7679].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the metaproteomic study of endogenous microbial amyloids present in the body has not been completed, and we know relatively little about microbial amyloid assembly in the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be necessary to include the production of amyloids by fungal as well as bacterial members [53, 54], and new microbiome studies should consider the taxonomic drivers of microbiota function, including the production of amyloid proteins [80].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

What_can_be_done_in_regard_to_prevention_and_therapy?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The role that intestinal microbes play during Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and related disorders is a particularly dynamic pursuit because the composition and diversity of the microbiota are so variable in the human population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are just beginning to see a plethora of approaches involving prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics, dietary interventions, fecal transplants, and other means by which gene therapy of microbial nucleotide sequences can be accomplished [81].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therapeutic approaches to neurodegenerative disease may someday include adapting the gut bacteria to support salutogenic species and other means.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We must ask if disease phenotypes can be modulated in persons after the initiation of disease [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although prevention is generally easier than cure, we should not assume a priori that the contribution of the microbiota to neurodegeneration cannot be repaired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plastic nature of the CNS and the capability of recovery should not be underestimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A unique partnership of scientific disciplines is needed to understand the complex interactions of human genes, diet, microbes, and aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diversity of bacteria, bacterial metabolites, and dietary fibers and other nutrients has been linked to human health and aging [82].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developments in the last few thousand years of human history have decreased our microbiome diversity compared with that of our ancestors, with arguably negative consequences for our health [83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to recognizing the importance of this biological diversity, we need also to be aware of the need for a diversity of approaches to these multifaceted problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not likely that investigators working with a singular approach will provide both the questions and the answers we need.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multidisciplinary nature of the processes by which our partner organisms influence our health suggests that we realize how little we know and recall the saying of James Clerk Maxwell, Thoroughly conscious ignorance is the prelude to every real advance in science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
