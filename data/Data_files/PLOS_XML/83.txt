Galectin-1 Prevents Infection and Damage Induced by Trypanosoma cruzi on Cardiac Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Background  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy caused by Trypanosoma cruzi is the result of a pathologic process starting during the acute phase of parasite infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among different factors, the specific recognition of glycan structures by glycan-binding proteins from the parasite or from the mammalian host cells may play a critical role in the evolution of the infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methodology_and_Principal_Findings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we investigated the contribution of galectin1 (Gal1), an endogenous glycan-binding protein abundantly expressed in human and mouse heart, to the pathophysiology of T. cruzi infection, particularly in the context of cardiac pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that exposure of HL1 cardiac cells to Gal1 reduced the percentage of infection by two different T. cruzi strains, Tulahuén (TcVI) and Brazil (TcI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Gal1 prevented exposure of phosphatidylserine and early events in the apoptotic program by parasite infection on HL1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects were not mediated by direct interaction with the parasite surface, suggesting that Gal1 may act through binding to host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we also observed that T. cruzi infection altered the glycophenotype of cardiac cells, reducing binding of exogenous Gal1 to the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these data, Gal1 deficient (Lgals1-/-) mice showed increased parasitemia, reduced signs of inflammation in heart and skeletal muscle tissues, and lower survival rates as compared to wild-type (WT) mice in response to intraperitoneal infection with T. cruzi Tulahuén strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion_Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results indicate that Gal1 modulates T. cruzi infection of cardiac cells, highlighting the relevance of galectins and their ligands as regulators of host-parasite interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Galectins are a family of endogenous lectins defined by a well-conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that recognizes -galactoside-related glycans presented by several glycoconjugates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up to now, fifteen galectins have been identified in a variety of cells and tissues and proposed to be crucial in diverse biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Galectin1 (Gal1), a prototype member of the galectin family, plays key roles in pathogen recognition and in the modulation of innate and adaptive host immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following infection with the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, Gal1 was found to be up-regulated in cardiac tissue from patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we identified a protective role of Gal1 in T. cruzi infection of cardiac cells, highlighting the ability of this parasite to control the glycophenotype of these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also disclose the relevance of parasite strain-dependent differences in Gal-1-mediated control of T. cruzi infection in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings presented here will contribute to delineate the role of Gal-1-glycan interactions during T. cruzi infection, particularly in the context of heart tissue injury, with critical implications in Chagas disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chagas disease, caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, represents the main cause of infectious heart disease in Latin America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is estimated that about 8 to 10 million people worldwide are infected with T. cruzi, mostly in Central and South America where Chagas disease is endemic [1,2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the last decade, an increased number of cases has been well documented in North America, Europe and Western Pacific, mostly because of the influx of immigrants from endemic countries [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In humans, the acute phase usually occurs with mild signs and symptoms that are not unique to this disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, being the cardiac muscle one of the most heavily parasitized tissues, myocarditis characterized by pericarditis, ventricular enlargement, conduction abnormalities and congestive heart failure is consistently observed in acutely infected patients, with an estimated mortality rate of 0.25 to 0.5%, often in children [6,7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myocarditis is found during symptomatic acute parasite infection, but also by histopathological examination of heart biopsies in patients with no apparent signs of cardiac disease [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, following acute infection, patients enter an asymptomatic phase, which lasts throughout life in the majority of infected subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 3040% of chronically infected individuals develop cardiac or digestive disorders (megaoesophagus and megacolon), or both, during their lifetime [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cardiac form is the most common and severe manifestation of Chagas disease, causing congestive heart failure, arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities, which often results in sudden death [911].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanisms linking the acute and chronic myocardial progression have not yet been clarified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, it is well accepted that the etiology of chagasic cardiomyopathy is multifactorial, suggesting multiple complex interactions between the host and the parasite [12,13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies revealed that the development of cardiac symptoms is associated with T. cruzi persistence and its genetic variability, and these effects are controlled by the host immune response, which involves activated T and B lymphocytes, myeloid cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines, cross-reactive antibodies and endogenous lectins [1417].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Galectin1, a proto-type member of the galectin family, has the ability to recognize N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) residues present in N- and O-glycans [18,19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lectin plays different roles governed not only by its relative concentrations but also by its subcellular compartmentalization [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While intracellular Gal1 controls signaling pathways via protein-protein or protein-glycan interactions, extracellular Gal1 plays key roles in cell aggregation, cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and regulation of cell survival, inflammation, immunity and angiogenesis [2025].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Seropian and colleagues demonstrated that Gal1 expression is up-regulated in cardiac cells exposed to hypoxic microenvironments or proinflammatory cytokines, as well as in peri-infarcted area of the mouse heart after experimental acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and in human cardiac tissue from patients with end-stage chronic failure [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, hearts from mice lacking the Gal1 gene (Lgals1-/-) which underwent experimental AMI, showed a higher number of inflammatory cells together with a lower number of regulatory T (Treg) cells compared with their wild-type (WT) counterpart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these findings suggest a potential role of Gal1 in controlling the inflammatory response in cardiac tissue exposed to internal or external insults [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With regards to T. cruzi infection, Gal1 has been found to be up-regulated in cardiac tissue from patients with severe chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, an increase frequency of anti-Gal1 autoantibodies was found to be associated with the severity of cardiac damage during the course of the disease [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas low concentrations of Gal1 increased the number of trypomastigotes (Tulahuén strain) in infected macrophages by diminishing IL12 production, high concentrations of this lectin promoted macrophages apoptosis and inhibited parasite replication [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of Gal1 during T. cruzi infection of cardiac cells has not been yet elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we undertook this study to investigate the expression and function of Gal1 in the adult murine cardiac cell line HL1 infected with two different phylogenetic discrete typing units (DTUs) of T. cruzi, namely the Brazil and Tulahuén strains, belonging to TcI and TcVI DTUs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we analyzed the impact of endogenous Gal1 during the course of experimental T. cruzi infection using the above mentioned T. cruzi strains, focusing on parasitemia, survival rates and heart alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings identify a protective role of Gal1 on T. cruzi infection of cardiac cells and demonstrate how parasite infection reprograms expression of cell surface glycans, shifting the balance toward a Gal-1-non-permissive glycophenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ethics_statement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clinical research protocols followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocols used in this study were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Fernandez Hospital (Buenos Aires, Argentina).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All patients gave written informed consent before blood collection and after the nature of the study were explained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animal studies were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition (2011).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocols used were approved by Animal Care Committee of the Instituto Nacional de Parasitología Dr. Mario Fatala Chaben, Administración Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud Dr. Carlos G. Malbrán (Buenos Aires, Argentina).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_population  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Patient selection was conducted at the Cardiovascular Division of Fernandez Hospital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive serology for Chagas disease was determined by two or more tests (indirect immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], indirect hemagglutination, or complement fixation) and those patients who had at least two of three reactive serological tests were considered T. cruzi infected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients underwent a complete clinical and cardiologic examination that included medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest, laboratory and chest X-ray examinations, and Doppler echocardiography evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exclusion criteria considered the presence of systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hydroelectrolytic disorders, alcoholism, history suggesting coronary artery obstruction and rheumatic disease, and the impossibility of undergoing clinical examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study population consisted of 28 patients who completed the screening protocol and were in the chronic phase of the infection, 19 patients with cardiac symptoms and 9 patients in the asymptomatic phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty-two non-infected individuals, within the same age range (3070 years old) which showed negative serological tests for Chagas disease, were included as control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Production_of_recombinant_Gal1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recombinant Gal1 (rGal1) was produced and purified essentially as described previously [23,29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS content of the purified samples (less_than60 ng/mg) was tested using a gel-clot Limulus test (Associates of Cape Cod, Falmouth, MA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Parasites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trypomastigotes of the Brazil and Tulahuén (stock Tul2) strains [30,31] were obtained from the extracellular medium of infected monolayers of Vero cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After separation of Vero cells and cellular debris by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min, trypomastigotes were collected by centrifugation at 2,200 x g for 10 min and resuspended in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parasites were counted using a Neubauer chamber and used for in vitro infection experiments as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bloodstream trypomastigotes of both strains were maintained in vivo by serial passages of blood-form trypomastigotes in BALB/c mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_cultures_and_transfection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HL1, an immortalized adult murine cardiac cell line, was plated onto gelatin/fibronectin pre-coated vessels and cultured in Claycomb medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine as previously described [32], under water jacketed incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
pcDNA3-Gal1 expression vector was cloned as previously described [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, HL1 cells were transiently transfected in a 24-well tissue plate with pcDNA3-Gal1 plasmid or empty vector (0.45 g DNA/well) using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, USA), according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were selected for resistance to Geneticine (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfection efficiency was tested by determining Gal1 concentration in the supernatants of HL1 cells by ELISA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

T_cruzi_trypomastigote_invasion_assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HL1 cells seeded on 12 mm cover-slips in 24-well tissue plates (2 x 104 cells/well), were incubated with rGal1 (10 or 50 g/ml) for 24 h, in the presence or absence of 100 mM lactose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, cardiac cells were infected with trypomastigotes of the Brazil or Tulahuén strains using two different protocols: a) cells were infected with a parasite-to-host cell ratio of 5:1 for 18 h; unattached parasites were then removed by washing with PBS and cells were kept in culture with fresh medium for additional 30 h or, b) cells were infected with a parasite-to-host cell ratio of 10:1 for 4 h; unattached parasites were removed by washing with PBS and cells were kept in culture with fresh medium for 4 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In experiments with pcDNA3-Gal-1-transfected HL1 cells, we directly infected the cells with trypomastigotes according to protocol a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, no differences were found in the percentage of infected cells between wild-type HL1 cells and those transfected with the plasmid alone (mock) (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the indicated time, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight, rinsed and kept for 5 min in 0.02 M glycine/ PBS pH 7.4 to quench reactive groups of the fixative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each manipulation was preceded by washing the cells three times in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After cell permeabilization with PBS-Triton X100 1% for 5 min and blocking with PBS-BSA 2%, intracellular parasite were identified by indirect immunofluorescence with sera from T. cruzi infected mice (dilution 1:1,000) as primary antibody (Ab) and Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA) as secondary Ab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dishes were mounted in Vectashield medium (Vector Labs, UK) containing DAPI and visualized using a fluorescence microscope at a magnification of 200X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired using an Olympus DP71 digital camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of cells was determined by using Cell Profiler software (version 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of infected cells was determined by counting an average of 3,500 cells in each slide on 35 distinct coverslips in randomly selected fields; each sample was tested in three to five replicates, in at least two independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cell was considered infected when contained at least one intracellular amastigote.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Infection_in_vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Age- and gender-matched mice with genetic deletion of the gene encoding Gal1 (Lgals1-/-) and WT mice with equivalent genetic background (C57BL/6) were kindly provided by Dr. Francoise Poirier (Jacques Monod Institute, Paris, France).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight-week-old mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 2,500 bloodstream trypomastigotes of the Brazil or Tulahuén strains resuspended in 200 l RPMI media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-infected Lgals1-/- and WT mice (n = 515) injected only with RPMI media were used as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parasitemia was determined twice a week from the second to the fifth week of infection by counting parasites in a 5 l drop of tail vein blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were expressed as the number of trypomastigotes per ml of blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survival was recorded daily until 95 dpi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For histopathological studies, infected and control mice were lightly anesthetized with Avertin (tribromoethanol) before sacrifice by cervical dislocation at 120 and 19 dpi with Brazil and Tulahuén strains, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hearts and skeletal muscle samples were harvested, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed routinely and embedded in paraffin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five micron thickness sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined at an Olympus DP71 light microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of parasitized cells per section and the extent of inflammation were recorded on a single blind basis as described previously [34,35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, different areas of the heart (atria, ventricular walls and septum) and skeletal muscle sections were evaluated qualitatively and scored according to the distribution (focal, confluent or diffuse) and the extent of inflammation as follows: normal (0); focal or a single inflammatory foci (1); multifocal, non-confluent inflammatory infiltrates (2); confluent inflammation with partial section involvement (3); diffuse inflammation extended through the section (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Annexin_V_staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HL1 cells (1 x 104 cells/well) seeded in a 48-well tissue plate were cultured in the presence of rGal1 (10 or 50 g/ml) for 18 h and then infected with 5 x 104 trypomastigotes of the Brazil or Tulahuén strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 18 h, cells were washed to remove unattached parasites and incubated for 48 h. Samples were finally processed for phophatidylserine exposure by using the FITC-Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Pharmingen, Chicago, IL, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS, were acquired using a FACSAria flow cytometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed with WinMdi software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gal1_binding_to_T_cruzi  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Glycophenotype_and_Gal1_binding_assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
T. cruzi-infected and non-infected HL1 cells were harvested at 5 dpi and counted in a Neubauer chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 1 x 105 cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml of cold PBS-BSA 1% and resuspended in lectin buffer-BSA 1%, containing the following biotin-conjugated lectins: PNA, SNA, HPA, LEL, PHA-L, MAL II (S2 Fig and S1 Table) at the appropriate concentration for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated with FITC conjugated streptavidin (BD Pharmingen, Chicago, IL, USA) in lectin buffer-BSA 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 min at room temperature, cells were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS and a minimum of 10,000 events were acquired on a FACSAria flow cytometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-specific binding was determined with FITC conjugated streptavidin alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data analyses were carried out with WinMdi software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were expressed as the percentage of positive cells or as the relative specific fluorescence index (SFI) for each lectin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative SFI was expressed by the ratio of the SFI of infected cells samples to that of non-infected cells samples; SFI was calculated by dividing mean fluorescence recorded with the specific biotinylated lectin and FITC-streptavidin by the fluorescence intensity obtained with FITC-streptavidin only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar procedure was performed to determine Gal1 binding to HL1 infected cells and non-infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, cells were incubated with rGal1 at three different concentrations (5, 10 and 50 g/ml) in the absence or presence of lactose (100 mM) and further revealed using a FITC-labeled anti-mouse Gal1 Ab (dilution 1:200 in lectin buffer-BSA 1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm the glycophenotype, paraformaldehyde-fixed infected and non-infected cells seeded in 12 mm cover slides were incubated with LEL and PHA-L and FITC conjugated streptavidin as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coverslips were visualized using a fluorescence microscope at a magnification of 200X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired using an Olympus DP71 digital camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ELISA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Soluble Gal1 was determined using an in-house ELISA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, high binding 96-well microplates (NuncMaxisorb) were coated with capture Ab (2 g/ml purified rabbit anti-Gal1 polyclonal IgG) in 0.1 M sodium carbonate pH 9.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation for 18 h at 4°C, wells were rinsed three times with wash buffer (0.05% Tween20 in PBS) and incubated for 1 h with blocking solution (2% BSA in PBS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples and standards (100 l) were diluted in PBS-BSA 1% and incubated for 18 h at 4°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plates were then washed and incubated with 100 ng/ml biotinylated detection Ab (purified rabbit anti-Gal1 polyclonal IgG) for 1 h. Plates were rinsed three times before adding horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (0.33 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing, 100 l of TMB solution (0.1 mg/ml tetramethylbenzidine and 0.06% H2O2 in citrate-phosphate buffer pH 5.0) was added to the plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was stopped by adding 2N HCl and Optical density (OD) was determined at 450 nm in a Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples were tested in duplicate, in two independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A standard curve ranging from 2.5 to 320 ng/ml of rGal1 was run in parallel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are expressed as means of duplicates, in ng/ml.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunoblot_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Infected and non-infected HL1 cells were washed with PBS, harvested and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl 150, 0.1% NP40) in the presence of a protease inhibitor kit (Complete Mini EDTA-free, Roche, Germany).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After protein quantification by Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), equal amount of protein (60 g per lane) was resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then immunoblotted with a rabbit anti-Gal1 polyclonal Ab (dilution 1:3,000) or a mouse monoclonal Ab for -actin (BD Pharmingen, Chicago, IL, USA) as a loading control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Labs, UK) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblots were visualized with the Immobilon chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bands were scanned and quantified using ImageJ software (version 1.410).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RT-qPCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Gibco/BRL, Grand Island, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reverse transcription was performed using oligodT and Superscript Reverse II transcriptase (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real time RT-PCR was done in Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett, UK) device using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed using the relative standard curve method and results were normalized with respect to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following primers were used: mouse Gal1, forward 5-TGAACCTGGGAAAAGACAGC3 and reverse 5-TCAGCCTGGTCAAAGGTGAT3; mouse GAPDH forward 5- ACTCCCACTCTTCCACCT -3 and reverse 5- TCCACCACCCTGTTGCT -3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression was calculated from the standard curves and then expressed in arbitrary units of Gal1 relative to GAPDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unless otherwise indicated, values are expressed as means ± SEM of at least three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical comparisons were performed with one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test for multiple-group comparisons, except for glycophenotype analysis where Dunnetts test was used to compare every mean with the control mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Gal1 expression determined by Western-blot, Students t test was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concentration of Gal1 measured by ELISA was evaluated by using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunns multiple comparison test, while parasitemia and histological findings were analyzed by using the Mann Whitney U test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Log-rank test was performed for statistical comparison of animal survival curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All tests were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pless_than0.05 was considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Elevated_Gal1_levels_in_sera_from_asymptomatic_and_symptomatic_patients_with_chronic_Chagas_Disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because Gal1 expression was higher in heart tissue from patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy who underwent cardiac transplantation [26], we first examined Gal1 levels in sera from patients during the chronic phase of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results showed that Gal1 was increased in sera from chronic chagasic patients compared with non-infected subjects (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no difference was observed between Gal1 levels in sera from cardiac patients compared with those from asymptomatic individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, elevated Gal1 levels delineate chronic Chagas Disease irrespective of cardiac pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

T_cruzi_infection_augments_Gal1_release__but_not_Gal1_expression_in_HL1_cardiac_cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the higher levels of Gal1 in sera and cardiac tissue in response to T. cruzi infection, we analyzed the expression of this lectin in infected and non-infected cardiac cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infected the murine cardiac cell line HL1 with trypomastigotes belonging to two different DTUs, Tulahuén (TcVI) or Brazil (TcI) strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of Gal1 was assessed after 2 and 5 days post infection (dpi) at the protein and mRNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HL1 cells infected with T. cruzi Tulahuén strain did not show any difference in the expression of either Gal1 mRNA or protein compared with non-infected cells at both times analyzed (Fig 2A and 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, cells infected with T. cruzi Brazil strain showed a slight reduction in Gal1 protein levels only after 2 dpi while no significant differences were achieved at mRNA level at any of the times tested (Fig 2A and 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when we analyzed the secretion of Gal1, we found increased amount of this lectin in supernatants of HL1 cells infected with T. cruzi (Tulahuén and Brazil strains) at day 5 post-infection (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate whether enhanced Gal1 secretion correlated with cellular lysis, we assessed the release of the cytoplasmatic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the culture media of infected HL1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results showed that LDH activity was considerably greater in supernatants of infected HL1 cells after 5 dpi using trypomastigotes of both strains (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data showed an association between Gal1 and LDH release, suggesting that increased lysis of cardiac cells might contribute to greater Gal1 secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To investigate the impact of Gal1 on T. cruzi infectivity of cardiac cells, HL1 cells were incubated with different concentrations of recombinant Gal1 (rGal1) during 24 h and then infected with trypomastigotes of both strains, Tulahuén and Brazil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, we used rGal1 doses which did not affect cell viability as evaluated by annexin V-FITC staining (S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 4 dpi with trypomastigotes of the Tulahuén strain, the percentage of infected cells significantly diminished in the presence of increasing concentration of rGal1 (Fig 3A and 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained when HL1 cells were infected with the Brazil strain, although a non-significant trend toward a decrease in T. cruzi infectivity was observed at 10 g/ml of rGal1 (Fig 3D and 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that rGal1 alters the infection of cardiac cells by T. cruzi, independently of the parasite lineage (TcI or TcVI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because at 4 dpi, the percentage of infected cells could be affected by multiple rounds of infection with T. cruzi, we evaluated the effect of rGal1 at early time periods of the infection cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 dpi, rGal1 at 50 g/ml diminished infection of cardiac cells by both T. cruzi lineages; this effect was prevented in the presence of lactose (Fig 3C and 3F), suggesting that the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of Gal1 may be involved in Gal1 modulation of parasite infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were observed when Gal1 transfected HL1 cells were infected with both T. cruzi strains (Fig 3G), indicating that both exogenous and endogenous Gal1 control parasite infectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further analyze the mechanistic bases of this effect, we evaluated whether rGal1 binds to trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, either from Tulahuén or from Brazil strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, no specific binding of rGal1 was observed with any of the parasite strains (Fig 4), either by fluorescence staining or by flow cytometry, suggesting that direct binding of Gal1 to the parasite does not account for the regulatory effects of this lectin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gal1_prevents_T_cruzi_induced_phosphatidylserine_exposure__an_early_apoptotic_event_in_HL1_cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability of T. cruzi trypomastigotes to control apoptotic programs in cardiac cells [36,37] and the ability of Gal1 to regulate viability of different cell types [18], prompted us to investigate the effect of this lectin in parasite induced phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, an early apoptotic event, on plasma membrane of HL1 cardiac cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we pre-incubated HL1 cells with rGal1 (10 and 50 g/ml) and, following infection with trypomastigotes of the Tulahuén or Brazil strain, annexin V staining was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While trypomastigotes of both strains induced considerably exposure of phosphatidylserine residues in HL1 cardiac cells, the percentage of annexin V-positive cells significantly diminished when cells were pre-incubated with 50 g/ml rGal1 before parasite infection (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that Gal1, not only reduces T. cruzi infectivity, but also protects cardiac cells from T. cruzi driven-phosphatidylserine exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

T_cruzi_induces_a_Gal1_resistant_glycophenotype_in_HL1_cardiac_cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test if T. cruzi infection induces changes in the glycophenotype of cardiac cells, we analyzed binding of a panel of biotinylated lectins that recognize specific glycan structures (S2 Fig and S1 Table) to HL1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection with trypomastigotes of the Tulahuén strain led to reduced binding of Lycopersicon Esculentum agglutinin (LEL), a lectin that recognizes poly-LacNAc-enriched glycans and phytohemagglutinin-L (PHA-L), a lectin that binds to 1,6-N-acetylglucosamine-branched complex N-glycans (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis by fluorescence microscopy confirmed these findings (Fig 6C), indicating that poly-LacNAc and complex branched N-glycans, which are key saccharide ligands required for Gal1 binding, are hindered in response to T. cruzi infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we analyzed reactivity for Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), a lectin that recognizes 2,6-linked sialic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results showed that the number of SNA+ HL1 cells was significantly higher after infection with trypomastigotes of the Tulahuén strain compared to non-infected cells (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gal1 preferentially recognizes poly-LacNAc units present on the branches of N- and O-glycans, but does not bind to 2,6-sialylated LacNAc residues [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we hypothesized that increased 2,6-linked sialic acid together with reduced poly-LacNAc and 1,6-branched N-glycans may limit Gal1 binding to the surface of infected cardiac cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, we analyzed binding of rGal1 to HL1 cells infected with T. cruzi Tulahuén strain, in the absence or presence of the galectin-specific disaccharide lactose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the surface glycophenotype of these cells, we detected lower binding of Gal1 to infected versus non-infected cardiac cells; an effect which was dose- and saccharide-dependent (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, infection of HL1 cells with trypomastigotes of the Brazil strain led only to reduction of PHA-L reactive complex N-glycans, although no changes were detected in the percentage of cells exposing 2-6-linked sialic acid on N-glycans (Fig 6A, 6B and 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, infection with T. cruzi Tulahuén strain selectively controls the glycosylation signature of cardiac cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strain-dependent regulatory effect may control Gal1 binding, parasite infection and cardiomyocyte function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_protective_role_of_Gal1_on_T_cruzi_infection_in_vivo_is_dependent_on_parasite_lineage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the relevance of Gal1 during T. cruzi infection in vivo, Lgals1-/- and WT female and male mice were examined for parasitemia, survival and histopathology, following intraperitoneal inoculation of the parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although mice were challenged with the same parasite inoculum size, the course of the infection was different according to the T. cruzi strain used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak of parasitemia in Tulahuén strain-infected mice (occurring at 1922 dpi) was higher than that recorded in mice infected with the Brazil strain (at 2628 dpi; pless_than0.05), suggesting strain-dependent differences in the in vivo infectivity of T. cruzi trypomastigotes (Fig 7A and S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Lgals1-/- mice infected with trypomastigote of the Tulahuén strain had significantly higher parasitemias compared to WT mice (pless_than0.05), regardless of the gender of the animals (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, levels of parasitemia were slightly higher in Lgals1-/- male mice infected with the Brazil strain compared to that of WT mice at 28 dpi, whereas no differences were found in female mice (S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The percentage of female Lgals1-/- mice that survived acute infection with T. cruzi Tulahuén strain was significantly lower (P = 0.0008; Fig 7B) and the mean survival time was shorter (P = 0.0127; S2 Table) compared to their WT counterpart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no differences in mortality rates and survival time between male Lgals1-/- and WT animals infected with trypomastigotes of the Tulahuén strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, mortality rates and survival time of Lgals1-/- mice infected with the Brazil strain were similar to that of their WT mice counterparts, regardless of mice gender (S4 Fig and S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differences in the survival rates and parasitemia in mice infected with T. cruzi Tulahuén strain, prompted us to analyze the histopathology of heart and skeletal muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density of parasitized cells was significantly higher in the heart, but not in the skeletal muscle of Lgals1-/- mice infected with T. cruzi Tulahuén strain at the peak of parasitemia, compared with WT mice; this effect was independent of the gender of the mice (pless_than0.05; Fig 8A and 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the inflammation score in Lgals1-/- mice was lower in the heart of females and in the skeletal muscle of male animals, compared with their WT counterparts (Fig 8A and 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the susceptibility or resistance to infection relies not only on the host but also on parasite genetics, we believe that, in our hands, Brazil strain had less infectivity for C57BL/6 mice and, probably higher inoculum of Brazil strain would recapitulate the results obtained with a more virulent T. cruzi strain such as Tulahuén.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our data indicate strain-dependent differences in Gal-1-mediated protection of T. cruzi infection in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The interaction between parasite and host cells is crucial for T. cruzi survival involving the recognition of a large number of ligands and/or receptors on the surface of both the parasite and the host cells [3741].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With regards to cardiomyocytes, carbohydrate residues of membrane glycoconjugates, like galactosyl, mannosyl, and sialyl residues, together with mannose receptors not only participate in parasite entry but are also regulated by the infection itself [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellularly, the parasite takes control of host cells, including cardiomyocytes which respond to infection with the production of cytokines, chemokines, metalloproteinases, and glycan-binding proteins [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Galectins, a family of glycan-binding proteins, have recently emerged as novel regulators of host-parasite interactions [42,43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With regards to T. cruzi infection, Pineda et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  recently showed the differential recognition by human Gal1, -3, -4, -7 and -8 of fourteen different strains of T. cruzi corresponding to the six lineages representing the genetic diversity of the parasite, suggesting strain-dependent glycosylation of the parasite surface [44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Gal3, the best studied galectin in the context of T. cruzi infection, is recruited during parasite invasion of host cells and influences intracellular trafficking of amastigotes [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, expression of Gal3 in the thymus of T. cruzi infected mice has been shown to determine the premature exit of immature T cells by modulating thymocyte-extracellular matrix interactions [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This chimera-type galectin has been found to be required for T. cruzi adhesion to human coronary artery smooth muscle cells and for B cell function following infection with the parasite [4749].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, mice lacking Gal3 showed increased blood parasitemia and impaired cytokine production during T. cruzi infection [50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the role of other members of the galectin family during T. cruzi infection still needs to be addressed, these data highlight the multifunctional role of these lectins in host-parasite communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we aimed at dissecting the role of Gal1 and its specific glycans in the infection of cardiac cells with T. cruzi trypomastigotes (lineages Tcl and TcVI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that Gal1 not only reduced infection by T. cruzi but also diminished phosphatidylserine exposure, an early apoptotic event driven by the parasite on HL1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was also reflected by -in vivo experiments showing that Lgals1-/- mice intraperitoneally inoculated with T. cruzi Tulahuén strain had higher parasitemia and lower survival rates than WT animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our data show that T. cruzi infection can reprogram the glycophenotype of cardiac cells toward a Gal1 resistant profile, thus highlighting a potential parasite strategy to avoid the beneficial inhibitory effects of Gal1 in host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This Gal1 restrictive glycophenotype is similar to that observed in T helper (Th)-2 polarized cells [23], in M2-type microglia [51] and in tumor-associated endothelial cells [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regarding the mechanisms underlying the effects of Gal1 on cardiac cells, it is well known that galectins can act by blocking or stimulating pathogen attachment and infection through binding to host or microbial glycans, or by interfering with molecular interactions required for microbial entry to host cells [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we found, both by flow cytometry and fluorescence staining, that Gal1 did not bind to T. cruzi surface glycans from any of the parasite strains analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we hypothesized that Gal1 released via an autocrine or paracrine pathway might recognize specific glycans on the surface of HL1 cardiac cells that are necessary for T. cruzi attachment and/or invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Gal1 could also act directly facilitating cytokine release by cardiac cells [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether cardiac cells are a major source of Gal1 production, we evaluated Gal1 mRNA and protein expression in infected HL1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even tough, T. cruzi infection did not induce Gal1 expression in HL1 cells, we observed increased amount of this lectin in culture media of infected cells, probably due to cellular damage generated by parasite release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result might explain the up-regulation of Gal1 in heart tissue from patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy as reported by Giordanengo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that Gal1 levels were greater in sera from patients with chronic Chagas disease, irrespective of cardiac alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, T. cruzi infection up-regulated Gal1 expression and secretion in different immune cells, including B cells and macrophages [28, 52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vivo studies confirmed the protective effect of Gal1 on T. cruzi infection observed in the in vitro assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lgals1-/- mice infected with T. cruzi Tulahuén strain showed higher parasitemia together with lower survival rate, which was more evident in female than male animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, histopathological analysis revealed a major number of parasites in the heart of those animals, but surprisingly Lgals1-/- mice showed a slightly decrease in the inflammatory response as compared to their WT counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on previous reports [53], we would expect that a strong inflammatory response will be accompanied by an increased parasite burden in the heart or skeletal muscle of Lgals1-/- mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, similar findings were reported in mice with genetic or acquired deficiencies of the immune system [35, 54, 55], supporting the notion that the lower inflammation observed in hearts of Lgals1-/- mice may be the result of a differential regulation of the immune responses in these knock-out animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, differences observed between genders are not unexpected; the immune response to some microorganisms and the subsequent clinical outcome of the infection are linked to host hormonal pathways [56, 57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, substantial disparities in male and female individuals have been clearly documented in T. cruzi infection [58, 59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the role of Gal1 in the complex parasite-driven immune-endocrine networks since important discrepancies in parasitemia and survival rates were observed in male and female animals lacking the Lgals1 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in a very recent study, Poncini and colleagues demonstrated that Lgals1-/- mice infected by intradermoplantar inoculation with T. cruzi RA strain, displayed lower mortality and parasite burden in muscle tissue than WT mice [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancy with our data could be associated with different administration routes as the presence of different phagocytic cell types at sites of inoculation and the local immune response triggered by T. cruzi infection may dictate not only changes in parasite load but also susceptibility or resistance to infection [6163].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these findings suggest that galectin-glycan interactions may influence the outcome of the infection depending on the strain of the parasite (Tulahuén, Brazil or RA), the route of infection (intraperitoneal or intradermoplantar inoculation) and the subtle differences in the immune responses triggered by each T. cruzi strain [6163].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, similar strain-specific divergences have been previously reported by Toscano et al., showing that endogenous Gal3 can differentially regulate the outcome of experimental malaria, when three distinct strains of rodent malaria parasites, Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL, Plasmodium berghei ANKA and Plasmodium chabaudi AS were inoculated in mice lacking Gal3 [64].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, our data suggest that the parasite may display evasive mechanisms to counteract the effect of Gal1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, T. cruzi infection altered the glycophenotype and decreased the availability of galectin-binding sites on cardiac cells as evidenced by increased 2-6-sialylation which prevented Gal1 recognition of poly-LacNAc structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in the glycophenotype were not as evident in HL1 cells infected with parasites belonging to the Brazil strain, which could explain, at least in part, the differential infectivity of this strain compared with the Tulahuén strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these findings, Vray et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  described that changes in glycosylation structures of infected dendritic cells rendered a profile that was more reactive with Gal3, affecting not only the infectivity, but also the migratory capacity of these cells in the context of Chagas disease [65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, it has been demonstrated that electric communication in the heart is modulated by regulated glycosylation, particularly by sialylation of the cardiac voltage-gated Na+ channels (Nav) and Kv [6668].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that parasite-induced remodeling of the host cell glycome might contribute to mechanical and functional alterations in the heart of infected host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that: a) Gal1 inhibits T. cruzi infection of cardiac cells, and b) parasite infection alters the surface glycophenotype of cardiac cells, restricting Gal1 and possibly limiting its inhibitory activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these effects were dependent on multiple parameters including parasite inoculum and strain, route of entry of the parasite and gender of the host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, modulation of Gal-1-glycan interactions in cardiac cells may influence parasite-induced heart injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are warranted to clarify the potential clinical relevance of our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
