TNF Drives Monocyte Dysfunction with Age and Results in Impaired Anti-pneumococcal Immunity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Monocyte phenotype and output changes with age, but why this occurs and how it impacts anti-bacterial immunity are not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, in both humans and mice, circulating monocyte phenotype and function was altered with age due to increasing levels of TNF in the circulation that occur as part of the aging process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ly6C+ monocytes from old (1822 mo) mice and CD14+CD16+ intermediate/inflammatory monocytes from older adults also contributed to this age-associated inflammation as they produced more of the inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNF in the steady state and when stimulated with bacterial products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an aged mouse model of pneumococcal colonization we found that chronic exposure to TNF with age altered the maturity of circulating monocytes, as measured by F4/80 expression, and this decrease in monocyte maturation was directly linked to susceptibility to infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ly6C+ monocytes from old mice had higher levels of CCR2 expression, which promoted premature egress from the bone marrow when challenged with Streptococcus pneumoniae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Ly6C+ monocyte recruitment and TNF levels in the blood and nasopharnyx were higher in old mice during S. pneumoniae colonization, bacterial clearance was impaired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counterintuitively, elevated TNF and excessive monocyte recruitment in old mice contributed to impaired anti-pneumococcal immunity since bacterial clearance was improved upon pharmacological reduction of TNF or Ly6C+ monocytes, which were the major producers of TNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, with age TNF impairs inflammatory monocyte development, function and promotes premature egress, which contribute to systemic inflammation and is ultimately detrimental to anti-pneumococcal immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As we age, levels of inflammatory cytokines in the blood and tissues increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this appears to be an inevitable part of aging, it ultimately contributes to declining health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epidemiological studies indicate that older adults with higher than age-average levels of inflammatory cytokines are at increased risk of acquiring, becoming hospitalized with and dying of Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia but how age-associated inflammation increased susceptibility to was not entirely clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the increase in the inflammatory cytokine TNF that occurs with age cause monocytes to leave the bone marrow prematurely and these immature monocytes produce more inflammatory cytokines when stimulated with bacterial products, thus further increasing levels of inflammatory cytokines in the blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although old mice have higher levels of these inflammatory monocytes arriving at the site of S. pneumoniae, they are not able to clear the bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By pharmacologically or genetically removing the inflammatory cytokine TNF or reducing the number of inflammatory monocytes we were able to restore antibacterial immunity in aged mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus we demonstrate that monocytes are both influenced by and contributors to age-associated inflammation and that chronic exposure to age-associated inflammation increases susceptibility to S. pneumoniae due to altering monocyte maturity and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Monocyte phenotype and function change with age but whether these changes contribute to susceptibility to infectious disease is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, monocytes can be subdivided based on their expression of the Ly6C antigen into Ly6Chigh (Ly6Chigh, CCR2high, CX3CR1low) and Ly6Clow (Ly6Clow, CCR2low, CX3CR1high) monocytes [1,2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, the functional equivalents are CD14++CD16-/+ and CD14+CD16++ monocytes, respectively [1,3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ly6Chigh monocyte output from the bone marrow to the blood increases in a CCR2-dependent manner early during infection [4,5], and they become the dominant monocyte subtype in the blood, preferentially homing to sites of inflammation[6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ly6Chigh monocytes produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines[4,5,7]; thus, they are often called inflammatory monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the elderly, numbers of circulating CD14++CD16+ and CD14++CD16- monocytes, are significantly higher[8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD14++CD16+ monocytes derived from elderly individuals are more senescent (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  have shorter telomeres) than other monocyte subsets and produce more pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL6, TNF, IL1, IL12p70) and have higher levels of some chemokine receptors (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCR2, CCR5, CCR7, CX3CR1) [9,10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to their ability to produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, Ly6Chigh monocytes contribute to the pathology of several models of chronic inflammation [11,12,13,14,15,16,17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During chronic inflammatory conditions, the number of circulating Ly6Chigh monocytes increase progressively[18] and their ablation is an effective strategy for decreasing pathology [16,17,19,20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether Ly6Chigh monocytes contribute to chronic age-associated inflammation and increased susceptibility to infection is not known and is the focus of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aging is accompanied by an increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukins 1 (IL1) and 6 (IL6) in the serum and tissues, a phenomenon that has been termed inflamm-aging[reviewed in[21,22]].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This age-associated, systemic state of chronic, low-grade inflammation (defined as para-inflammation by Medzhitov[23])is well-documented although its cellular source has yet to be definitively identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adipose tissue[24], CD4+ T cells or macrophages[25,26] have all been proposed to contribute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increases in serum cytokines (particularly IL6 and TNF) are generally thought to be a pathological consequence of aging, as they correlate with risk of classical diseases of age such as dementia[27], stroke[28], cardiovascular disease[29] as well as frailty[30,31] and all-cause mortality[32,33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, lower than average levels of age-associated inflammation predict good health in age[34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, most chronic inflammatory conditions are characterized by increased numbers of CD14++CD16+ and/or CD14++CD16- monocytes [35,36,37,38,39,40,41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we investigate the role of monocytes, which are known to be critical mediators of chronic inflammation, contribute to age-associated inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inflamm-aging contributes to susceptibility to infectious disease, and particularly pneumonia, which is a major cause of death in the elderly[42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Susceptibility to pneumonia correlates with increased levels of IL6 and TNF before an infection [43,44,45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When young mice are infused with TNF, they become as susceptible to experimental infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae as old mice[46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a mouse model of pneumococcal colonization, we investigated whether changes in monocyte phenotype adversely affect host defense towards S. pneumoniae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that with age that there is an in increase in circulating Ly6C+ monocytes during the steady state due to increased expression of CCR2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using heterochronic bone marrow chimeras, we demonstrate that the aging microenvironment, rather than intrinsic changes in myeloid progenitors, drives changes in monocyte phenotype, including decreased expression of F4/80 (a marker of maturity), and increased expression of CCR2 (required for monocyte mobilization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that age-associated increases in TNF are the driving factor behind changes in monocyte phenotype, as TNF deficiency or treatment with anti-TNF antibodies normalizes expression of CCR2 on Ly6C+ monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased CCR2 expression results in decreased numbers of monocytes in the circulation and reduced production of TNF and IL6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrate that, although TNF levels and the recruitment of Ly6C+ monocytes are increased in old mice during nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae colonization, this, counterintuitively, results in diminished bacterial clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To our knowledge, this is the first mechanistic study that investigates the role of Ly6C+ monocytes as central mediators of inflamm-aging and demonstrates that TNF is a key contributor to age-associated defects in myeloid phenotype and anti-bacterial function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that Ly6C+monocyte frequency and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines contributes to both age-associated inflammation and declining anti-bacterial immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ly6C+_monocytes_increase_with_age_in_the_blood_and_bone_marrow_but_are_phenotypically_and_functionally_different  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been reported that with age the proportion of myeloid cells and cytokines in the blood is increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantitated circulating leukocyte populations in old (1822 mo) mice and found that, consistent with previously published data[47,48], there was a decrease in the percentage of T cells and an increase in the number of myeloid cells when compared with young (1014 wk) mice (Fig 1A & S1A Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of monocyte subsets indicated that the absolute number of both Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes was increased with age (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in Ly6Chigh monocyte frequency within the blood of old mice was paralleled by a similar increase in the bone marrow (Fig 1B), suggesting that increased myelopoiesis within the bone marrow may precede increased numbers of these cells in the blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, we also found that the number of M-CSF responsive cells (myeloid precursors and monocytes capable of differentiating into bona fide macrophages ex vivo) in the bone marrow was significantly increased with age (S1C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) is expressed at high levels on Ly6Chigh monocytes and is essential for their entry into the blood in response to the production of CCL2[49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since CCR2 is required for monocytes, and especially Ly6Chigh monocytes, to leave the bone marrow and enter the blood, we hypothesized that enhanced CCR2 expression on Ly6Chigh monocytes could prompt their premature emigration from the bone marrow and could explain the increased number of Ly6Chighmonocytes seen with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCR2 expression was measured on Ly6Chigh monocytes in the blood and bone marrow of old mice and found to be dramatically increased (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous research[1], CCR2 expression was more pronounced on Ly6Chigh monocytes (S1E Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Ly6Chigh monocytes represent an intermediate stage in monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, we investigated their maturity using the monocyte/macrophage maturity marker, F4/80.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that there was an inverse relationship between CCR2 expression and F4/80 expression on Ly6Chigh monocytes in the blood of old mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With age, these cells showed significantly decreased levels of F4/80 (Fig 1D), suggesting that their increased CCR2 expression may prompt these cells to enter the circulation in an immature state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When CCR2 expression was measured on myeloid precursors undergoing M-CSF-stimulated differentiation into macrophages, increased CCR2 expression occurred during an intermediate stage of differentiation (day 5) on cells from old mice (S1D Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether increased CCR2 expression was sufficient to increase Ly6Chigh monocyte egress, we intraperitoneally injected young and old mice with 100 nM of CCL2 and measured Ly6Chigh monocyte recruitment after 4 hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that despite administering an equivalent dose of CCL2, Ly6Chigh monocyte recruitment to the peritoneum was increased ~5-fold in old mice relative to young mice (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A less dramatic increase in Ly6Clow monocytes was also observed (Fig 1E), consistent with previous studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Monocytes_are_potent_producers_of_pro-inflammatory_cytokines_with_age  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since we found that there was an expansion of monocytes with age and these cells are known to be potent producers of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we postulated that they might contribute significantly to age-associated inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the increased numbers of monocytes with age contributed to age-associated increases in IL6 production, we targeted this cell population using carboxylated polystyrene microparticles (PS-MPs), which have been shown by others to lead to a reduction of primarily Ly6Chigh monocytes in the blood[50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that when circulating monocytes were decreased in old mice (Fig 2A), this reduced circulating levels of IL6 (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, CD14++CD16+HLA-DR+/intermediate monocytes are the biggest producers of inflammatory cytokines under a variety of stimulation conditions [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular cytokine staining reveals that of the three human monocyte populations (classical, intermediate, non-classical) intermediate monocytes are the major producers of TNF (Fig 3A) and IL6 (Fig 3B) after stimulation with LPS or S. pneumoniae and older donors (6370 yrs) produce more cytokines than younger donors (2652 yrs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, CD14+ monocytes isolated from PBMCs from older donors produced more TNF (Fig 3C) and IL6(Fig 3D) in response to LPS than did younger donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in mice, the numbers of intermediate monocytes may be influenced by levels of age-associated inflammation since the frequency of intermediate monocytes, are positively correlated with plasma TNF (Fig 3E) as has been shown to occur in other chronic inflammatory conditions [51].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A weaker correlation (pless_than0.02) was observed between TNF levels and the numerically dominant classical monocytes and no correlation was found between non-classical monocytes and TNF (p = 0.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_age-associated_increase_in_circulating_pro-inflammatory_monocytes_is_regulated_by_TNF  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether age-related changes in Ly6Chigh monocyte numbers, phenotype and inflammatory capacity were caused by changes in the aging bone marrow microenvironment or due to intrinsic changes in the myeloid precursors themselves, we created heterochronic bone marrow chimeras.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When young bone marrow was transferred to old recipient mice the number of Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes was increased to levels comparable to old mice (Fig 1A) or old recipient mice who had received old donor marrow (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, young recipient mice that had received old donor marrow had Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocyte numbers comparable to young mice (Fig 1A) or to young recipient mice that had received young donor bone marrow (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the increase in CCR2 expression observed on circulating monocytes from old mice (Fig 1C) was also observed in circulating monocytes from old recipient mice who had received young donor marrow but not on young recipient mice who received old donor marrow(Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that increases of Ly6C+ monocytes and increased CCR2 expression occur in a manner entirely dependent on the bone marrow microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since TNF is one of the central cytokines associated with inflamm-aging, we investigated whether TNF was sufficient to drive expansion of the Ly6Chigh monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We aged TNF knockout (KO) mice (1822 mo) and quantified Ly6Chigh monocytes in their blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, unlike their WT counterparts, old TNF KO mice did not have higher numbers of circulating Ly6Chigh monocytes (Fig 4C), but did have an increase in bone-marrow Ly6Chigh monocytes compared to their young counterparts (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface expression of CCR2 on Ly6Chigh monocytes in both the blood (Fig 4E) and the bone marrow (Fig 4F) of old TNF KO mice was comparable to the levels seen in young mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly there were no changes in Ly6Clow monocytes in aged TNF KO mice (S1D Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These data suggest that increased production of Ly6Chigh monocytes in the bone marrow occur independent of TNF, but that increases in CCR2 expression on these cells in the bone marrow, and their subsequent mobilization to the blood is TNF-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our observation that Ly6C+monocytes contribute to elevated levels of circulating cytokines with age (Fig 2), old WT mice produced more IL6 than young mice following 24 hour stimulation of whole blood with either PBS or LPS (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, old TNF KO mice, which did not have an increase of Ly6C+monocytes in the blood did not have an age-associated increase in IL6 in whole blood in response to PBS or LPS (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Blockade_of_TNF_reverses_age-associated_increases_in_Ly6Chigh_monocytes_and_inflammation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated whether it was chronic or acute exposure to TNF that mediated age-related increases in serum IL6 and changes in monocyte phenotype and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first sought to determine whether increases in circulating Ly6C+ monocytes were inducible after administration of TNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNF (5ng/g) was administered intraperitoneally for 3 weeks, a time point chosen because it would allow for multiple cycles of monopoiesis and complete turnover of pre-formed monocytes [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young mice showed a large increase in Ly6Chigh monocytes in the blood and a less dramatic increase of Ly6Clow monocytes (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was accompanied by a significant increase in serum IL6 in TNF-treated, but not vehicle control mice (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next asked whether blocking TNF could reduce numbers of Ly6C+ monocytes in old animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young and old WT mice were administered Adalimumab (HUMIRA), a human monoclonal antibody specific for TNF, or an IgG isotype control at a dose of 50 ng/g for a period of three weeks via intraperitoneal injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-TNF therapy reduced the levels of plasma TNF from an average of 1.5 pg/ml to below the level of detection (LOD = 0.25pg/ml) in old mice and decreased the number of circulating Ly6Chigh but not Ly6Clow monocytes in the blood to levels similar to young mice (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-TNF therapy also reduced CCR2 expression on Ly6Chigh monocytes in the blood of old mice to levels that are equivalent to those seen in young mice (Fig 5D) and reduced the percentage of monocytes that stained positive for IL6 or TNF by ICS after LPS stimulation (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-TNF treatment reduces IL6 levels in the circulation of old mice (Fig 5F) and when blood from young and old mice treated with anti-TNF or IgG controls was stimulated with LPS, IL6 levels were lower in old mice treated with anti-TNF compared to those that were treated with IgG(Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Circulating_and_recruited_Ly6Chigh_monocytes_are_increased_with_age_during_S_pneumoniae_colonization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to determine if age-related changes in Ly6Chigh monocyte numbers or maturity might play a role in defective anti-bacterial immunity with age, we investigated the trafficking of these cells following nasopharyngeal colonization of young and old mice with the bacterial pathogen, S. pneumoniae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected this pathogen specifically because of the high burden of disease caused by S. pneumoniae in elderly individuals and because it has been previously demonstrated that its clearance from the nasopharynx is largely dependent on recruited monocytes/macrophages[53,54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following intranasal delivery of S. pneumoniae, we found that old mice had defects in clearance of the colonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By Day 21 most of the young mice had cleared the bacteria, while old mice still harbored high bacterial loads (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Old mice were also more susceptible to bacterial invasion to the lungs at day 3 (Fig 6B) and mortality throughout the course of colonization (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although serum production of CCL2 in old mice was comparable to that of young mice (Fig 6D), old mice had increased Ly6Chigh but not Ly6Clow monocyte numbers in the circulation during colonization (days 3, 7, 14, 21) (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated whether the monocytes/macrophages recruited in the context of age had maturity defects (as measured by F4/80 expression).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In old mice, circulating Ly6Chigh monocytes had decreased expression of F4/80 during colonization (Fig 6F), suggesting that the decreased F4/80 expression seen in the bone marrow during the steady state (Fig 1D) perpetuates following their egress during infectious challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite their inability to control bacterial loads in the nasopharynx, old mice also had a significant increase in the expression of CCL2 in the nasopharynx during colonization (Fig 6G), and had higher numbers of recruited Ly6Chigh monocytes (Fig 6H) and macrophages (Fig 6I) to the nasopharynx compared to young mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although resident macrophages from young and old mice present in the nasopharynx during the steady state expressed equal levels of F4/80, monocytes/macrophages recruited to the nasopharynx during S. pneumoniae colonization showed decreased expression F4/80(Fig 6J), similar to that seen in their counterparts in the blood(Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to determine whether bacterial binding and internalization was different between monocytes derived from young and old mice we compared bacterial binding (measured at 4Â°C) and internalization/killing (measured at 37Â°C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there was a significant decrease in bacterial binding between young and old mice, this did not appear to affect internalization or bacterial killing (Fig 6K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ly6C+_monocytes_impair_clearance_of_S_pneumoniae_with_age  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although trafficking of blood monocytes was not impaired with age, old mice nonetheless displayed impaired clearance of S. pneumoniae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explain this, we hypothesized that high levels of recruited but developmentally immature Ly6Chigh monocytes could, in fact, have negative consequences for clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, TNF, which we showed caused increased numbers of Ly6Chigh monocytes in the blood (Fig 4A), was increased with age during S. pneumoniae colonization in the nasopharynx (Fig 7A) and blood (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next compared nasopharyngeal bacterial loads in WT and TNF KO mice, to determine whether TNF production affected bacterial clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although TNF had no effect on clearance of colonization in young mice we found that old TNF KOs had significantly fewer CFUs in the nasopharnyx compared to their old WT counterparts at day 3 (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Old TNF KO mice also had decreased recruitment of Ly6Chigh monocytes in the blood (Fig 7D), confirming that TNF can regulate mobilization of these cells during infection as well as in the steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the decreased recruitment of Ly6Chigh monocytes we observed was responsible for improved bacterial clearance in old TNF KO mice, we preferentially targeted this cell population using negatively-charged polystyrene microparticles (PS-MPs) (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that there were also decreases in monocytes in the lungs, but not neutrophils with this treatment (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Old mice were given PS-MPs on day prior to and every 3 days during the course of S. pneumoniae colonization and bacterial loads were measured at day 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PS-MP-treated old mice had increased survival (Fig 8B), less weight loss (Fig 8C)and lower bacterial loads in the nasopharynx (Fig 8D), lungs (Fig 8E) and spleen (Fig 8F) compared to old control mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were observed with Gr-1 antibody, which reduces numbers of monocytes and neutrophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data confirm that increased trafficking of this cell type during S. pneumoniae colonization impairs host defense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Epidemiological data strongly suggests that there is a reciprocal link between pneumonia and age-associated inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Older adults who have higher than age-average levels of the cytokines TNF and IL6 in their circulation have a much higher risk of acquiring pneumonia than their peers who have lower than age-average levels[55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a robust inflammatory response is generally thought to be protective against infection, in the elderly, high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines during pneumonia are associated with more severe disease and higher mortality[56,57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, having a chronic inflammatory disease such as dementia, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease is strongly associated with susceptibility to acquiring pneumonia [58,59,60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, having a pneumonia in mid- to late-life can often exacerbate or accelerate sub-clinical or existing chronic inflammatory conditions and can be the harbinger of declining health and decreased quality of life[58,59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although descriptions of this reciprocal relationship between chronic, age-associated inflammation and pneumonia, especially that caused by S. pneumoniae, are strong, the mechanistic explanations are weak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein we demonstrate that monocytes, both contribute to age-associated inflammation and are impaired by chronic exposure to the inflammatory cytokine TNF, and this ultimately impairs their anti-pneumococcal function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data using aged TNF KO mice or anti-TNF therapy indicate that the increased levels of TNF that occur with age impair monocyte development and ultimately anti-bacterial immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although macrophages have previously been shown to promote inflamm-aging[61], our data suggest that this may begin earlier in myelopoesis since monocytes produce more inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL6 with age and ablation of monocytes reduces levels of serum cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in circulating monocytes did not occur in old TNF KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, by treating young WT mice with a low-dose regime of TNF delivered intraperitoneally, we found that Ly6C+ monocytes were increased in the blood in a manner similar to old mice, demonstrating that TNF is sufficient to increase numbers of circulating Ly6C+ monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monocytes appear to be both highly responsive to increased levels of TNF but also seem to be a major source of age-associated TNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our observational studies in humans imply that the numbers of intermediate (CD14++CD16-) monocytes, which we have previously shown express higher levels of CCR2 with age [62], correlate with increased levels of TNF and contribute to hyper-inflammatory responses to bacterial infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in patients on anti-TNF therapy for rheumatoid arthritis validate our observations that TNF drives increases in inflammatory monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these patients anti-TNF therapy decreases the levels of circulating CD14++CD16- monocytes in the blood and synovial fluid as well as decreases CCR2 expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and thus is consistent with our data demonstrating that TNF-mediated changes in CCR2 expression are sufficient to alter the numbers of Ly6Chigh monocytes in the circulation [63,64].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, decreases in CD14++CD16- monocytes correlate with a positive prognostic response for patients, but whether this is because they contribute directly to disease progression or the inflammatory tone of rheumatoid arthritis is not known [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increases in Ly6Chigh monocytes are associated with defects in maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our chimera data demonstrate that phenotypic changes in monocytes (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCR2 and F4/80 expression) were not due to intrinsic defects in myeloid precursors but rather the influence of the bone marrow microenvironment, and, since these changes did not occur in TNF KO mice, TNF produced in the context of the microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although F4/80 levels were equivalent on blood monocytes during the steady state, they were lower on Ly6Chigh monocytes/differentiating macrophages recruited during nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae colonization in old mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes had functional significance; despite robust Ly6Chigh monocyte recruitment and TNF production in old mice, bacterial clearance was significantly impaired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, our data suggest that TNF is detrimental to clearance of S. pneumoniae from the nasopharynx with age, as old TNF KO mice had lower bacterial loads compared to their WT counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although TNF is often thought of as a key anti-bacterial cytokine, mouse studies have demonstrated that TNF is required for control for S. pneumoniae bacteremia but not for survival in lung infection[65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, old TNF KO mice recruited fewer circulating Ly6Chigh monocytes during S. pneumoniae colonization compared to old WT mice and counter-intuitively, this appeared to be protective against infection as when we depleted circulating Ly6Chigh monocytes using carboxylated polystyrene microparticles colonization, bacterial loads in the nasopharynx decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with the clinical observation that rheumatoid arthritis patients (who have high levels of circulating TNF) are at increased risk of pneumonia but that there is no increase in risk of pneumonia for patients on anti-TNF therapy [66].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether pneumonia risk is decreased with anti-TNF therapy is not known; however, patients on anti-TNF therapy do live slightly longer than their untreated counterparts, despite an increased risk in re-activation of chronic infections[67,68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These observations have important therapeutic significance, since the belief that host responses to bacteria are impaired with age due to poor innate cell recruitment has been the foundation of two large clinical trials testing the use of cytokines (G-CSF) to mobilize myeloid cells as an adjunct to antibiotics and one clinical trial testing GM-CSF as an adjuvant for pneumococcal vaccination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although mouse models (tested in young mice) showed promise, these strategies all failed when tested in populations where the median ages were 59, 61 and 68, respectively [reviewed in[69] and[70]].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggests that use of G-CSF, GM-CSF or other myeloid chemoattractant-based therapies in older adults would enhance recruitment of a population that is fundamentally immature and predisposed towards TNF and IL6 production that provides no functional benefit to the host for clearance and may even exacerbate infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our data suggest that monocytes are both contributors to age-associated inflammation and have altered anti-pneumococcal function as a result of age-associated inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lowering levels of TNF may be an effective strategy in improving host defence against S. pneumoniae in older adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, it has been shown that immunosuppressive steroid use in combination with antibiotics reduces pneumonia mortality in the elderly[71,72,73,74], although uptake for this therapy has been limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it may be counterintuitive to limit inflammatory responses during a bacterial infection, the clinical observations and our animal model indicates that anti-bacterial strategies need to be tailored to the age of the host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
