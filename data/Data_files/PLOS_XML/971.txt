In Silico Knockout Studies of Xenophagic Capturing of Salmonella  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The degradation of cytosol-invading pathogens by autophagy, a process known as xenophagy, is an important mechanism of the innate immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inside the host, Salmonella Typhimurium invades epithelial cells and resides within a specialized intracellular compartment, the Salmonella-containing vacuole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fraction of these bacteria does not persist inside the vacuole and enters the host cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salmonella Typhimurium that invades the host cytosol becomes a target of the autophagy machinery for degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The xenophagy pathway has recently been discovered, and the exact molecular processes are not entirely characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete kinetic data for each molecular process is not available, so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a mathematical model of the xenophagy pathway to investigate this key defense mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we present a Petri net model of Salmonella xenophagy in epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model is based on functional information derived from literature data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It comprises the molecular mechanism of galectin-8-dependent and ubiquitin-dependent autophagy, including regulatory processes, like nutrient-dependent regulation of autophagy and TBK1-dependent activation of the autophagy receptor, OPTN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To model the activation of TBK1, we proposed a new mechanism of TBK1 activation, suggesting a spatial and temporal regulation of this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using standard Petri net analysis techniques, we found basic functional modules, which describe different pathways of the autophagic capture of Salmonella and reflect the basic dynamics of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify the model, we performed in silico knockout experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We introduced a new concept of knockout analysis to systematically compute and visualize the results, using an in silico knockout matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the in silico knockout analyses were consistent with published experimental results and provide a basis for future investigations of the Salmonella xenophagy pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Salmonellae are Gram-negative bacteria, which cause the majority of foodborne diseases worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serovars of Salmonella cause a broad range of diseases, ranging from diarrhea to typhoid fever in a variety of hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the year 2010, Salmonella Typhi caused 7.6 million foodborne diseases and 52 000 deaths, and Salmonella enterica was responsible for 78.7 million diseases and 59 000 deaths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After invasion of Salmonella into host epithelial cells, a small fraction of Salmonella escapes from a specialized intracellular compartment and replicates inside the host cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xenophagy is a host defense mechanism to protect the host cell from cytosolic pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding how Salmonella is recognized and targeted for xenophagy is an important subject of current research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, no mathematical model has been presented so far, describing the process of Salmonella Typhimurium xenophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present a manually curated and mathematically verified theoretical model of Salmonella Typhimurium xenophagy in epithelial cells, which is consistent with the current state of knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model reproduces literature data and postulates new hypotheses for future investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inside the host, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, in the following referred to as Salmonella, can invade phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, such as intestinal epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After invasion of epithelial cells, the bacterium resides and starts replication inside the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fraction of the bacteria does not stay inside the SCV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SCV membrane becomes damaged, and Salmonella gets access to the host cytosol and starts to replicate with high rates [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To protect the host cell, Salmonella rapidly becomes a target of xenophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Xenophagy, also known as antibacterial autophagy, is a process of capturing and eliminating cytosolic pathogens, like Salmonella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xenophagy is an early defense mechanism against pathogens that enter the cytosol [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytosolic bacteria are targeted with ubiquitin or galectin-8 [46], leading to the recruitment of the autophagy receptors, p62 [7], nuclear dot protein 52 kDa (NDP52) [8], and optineurin (OPTN) [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autophagy receptors simultaneously bind ubiquitin- or galectin-8-labeled Salmonella as well as the autophagic protein of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)/-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) family to recruit LC3/GABARAP-positive autophagosomal membranes [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the bacteria are engulfed by an isolated membrane termed phagophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phagophore elongates and forms a double-membrane compartment, the autophagosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The autophagosome can fuse with lysosomes, resulting in the destruction of the bacteria in the autolysosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defects in this defense pathway of xenophagy are linked to chronic inflammation, like Crohns disease [1116].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The xenophagy pathway has recently been discovered, and the exact molecular details are still not completely understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many bacteria have been shown to be targeted for the xenophagy pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until now, Salmonella is the best-studied model organism for xenophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither quantitative nor qualitative mathematical models, describing the process of Salmonella xenophagy, have been presented so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing literature provides a rich repertoire of molecular interaction information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compile the known information and to analyze the biological system of xenophagy, we developed a mathematical model of Salmonella xenophagy in HeLa cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We applied the Petri net (PN) formalism [17] to analyze the structure of the model and the basic dynamics of the system, even without explicit knowledge of the kinetic data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PN have been successfully employed to study signaling pathways and regulatory networks [1823]; for an overview see [17, 24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model recapitulates in detail the molecular mechanisms of Salmonella xenophagy, including the galectin-8 and ubiquitin-dependent targeting of cytosolic Salmonella and of Salmonella inside the damaged SCV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the model comprises regulations like nutrient-dependent regulation of autophagy and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-dependent activation of the autophagy receptor, OPTN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism of TBK1 activation in HeLa cells upon Salmonella infection is not known, but it has been shown that a knockdown of TBK1 increases Salmonella replication in HeLa cells [8, 9, 25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To model the activation of TBK1, we proposed a new mechanism of TBK1 activation, suggesting an autoactivation by TBK1 oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed invariant properties to check the model for consistency and biologically meaningful behavior [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To observe the model behavior and the corresponding biological effect, we performed in silico knockouts of specific proteins, e.g., NDP52, OPTN, and TBK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the model behavior with published knockout and knockdown experiments to verify the biological credibility of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockouts that has not been experimentally investigated yet provide new hypotheses for further studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can help to plan further experiments more precisely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mathematical modeling is an iterative process, see S1 Fig The iterative process consists of four steps: literature research, model development/modification, model analysis, and model verification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, we performed an extensive literature research to manually collect functional information about Salmonella xenophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the fact that the xenophagy pathway was recently discovered, no data are currently available in public databases, such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We started with a small Petri net model based on a few references.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we checked the model structure for consistency, correctness, and completeness on the basis of PN theory [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mathematical analysis based on PN theory was essential to detect model structures that contradict the biological knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To resolve the identified inconsistencies, we repeatedly studied the literature and modified the wrongly extended model structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If no further inconsistencies were found, step by step, we extended the Petri net by functional information from the literature based on experiments, including, among others, yeast two-hybrid assays, pull-down assays, co-immunoprecipitation, knockdowns, knockouts, and X-ray crystallography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 Table gives a complete list of the literature references we used to build the network model of the xenophagy pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The iterative process of network validation, correction, and extension terminated with a PN model, which contains all known processes of Salmonella xenophagy in epithelial cells at the current state of research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Petri_nets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Due to the well-established analysis techniques, the expandability to a quantitative model, and the intuitive graphical representation of PN, the PN formalism is widely used for modeling and simulating biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following, we give a short explanation of PN terms and methods that are necessary to understand the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a more comprehensive introduction to the formalism and analysis techniques of PN, we refer to Koch et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2011 and Reisig 2012 [17, 27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PN are directed, bipartite, labeled graphs, consisting of two types of nodes, places and transitions, connected by directed, weighted arcs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Places, modeling the passive part, represent biological substances, such as proteins or protein complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transitions, representing the active part, stand for chemical reactions, such as binding reactions, dissociations, or degradations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A transition is called input transition if the transition has only outgoing and no incoming arcs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A transition is called output transition if the transition has only incoming and no outgoing arcs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Places and transitions are graphically represented as circles and rectangles, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arcs are labeled by integer numbers, which correspond to the stoichiometric factors of the biochemical reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Places can carry movable objects called tokens, which can move along the arcs by firing of transitions and reflect the systems dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of tokens over all places is called marking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The marking of the model defines the state of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The systems state before any transition has fired is called initial state with an initial marking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A token can have different meanings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tokens may represent a discrete amount of chemical substances, e.g., one molecule or number of organisms as Salmonella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A token on a place may alternatively represent a fulfilled precondition of a reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a precondition could be, e.g., the availability of a substance above a given threshold level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To simplify the graphical layout of the PN, we applied logical places for substances participating in many reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Logical places are identical graphical copies of a biological substance involved in various reactions of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To design, analyze, and simulate the PN, we used the open-source tool MonaLisa [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We structurally verified the model by the analysis of invariant properties called transition invariants (T-invariants) and place invariants (P-invariants) [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mathematically, a T-invariant represents a set of transitions, whose firing reproduces an arbitrary state of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biologically, a T-invariant describes a functional module at steady-state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each T-invariant has to represent a biological meaningful subpathway of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verified the biological interpretation of each T-invariant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If each transition is a member of at least one T-invariant, the PN is covered by T-invariants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mathematically, a P-invariant represents a set of places, for which the weighted number of tokens remains constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each P-invariant corresponds to the conservation of a biological substance, e.g., of an enzyme that is neither synthesized nor degraded in the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We checked the biological interpretation of each P-invariant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a more strict verification, we deleted all input and output transitions of the PN and checked the biological interpretation of the P-invariants of the resulting subnetwork.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subnetwork without input and output transitions has much more P-invariants than the original and should be covered by P-invariants, i.e., each place is a member of at least one P-invariant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A biological PN should be connected, covered by T-invariants, and each of the invariants has to have a biological meaning [20, 24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_silico_knockout_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Once we had constructed and verified a model, we performed in silico knockout analyses to examine the model behavior for perturbations of specific proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a transition is knocked out, all T-invariants that contain the corresponding transition are affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed single as well as double knockout experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We visualized the results of the knockout experiments using a sensitivity matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rows and columns indicate the proteins of the model, whose synthesis, i.e., input transitions, has been knocked out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entries represent the influence of the knockout experiments on the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This influence is measured by the percentage of the affected T-invariantsa measure for the models sensitivity to perturbations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diagonal of the matrix shows the influence of the single knockouts on the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the influence of a knockout on proteins or protein complexes, we introduce a new concept of in silico knockout analyses based on T-Invariants and visualize the results in the in silico knockout matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rows of this matrix represent a certain knockout, e.g., the deletion of an input transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The columns represent the proteins or protein complexes, which may be affected by the knockout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entries of the matrix are binary values encoded by either a red or a green circle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An entry is green, if the substance can be produced under steady-state conditions, i.e., the substance is the outgoing place of a transition that is part of a T-invariant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An entry is red, if the substance can not be produced under steady-state conditions, i.e., the substance is not the outgoing place of a transition that is part of a still functional T-invariant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biologically, a green entry indicates that the knockout has no effect on, e.g., the production of a substance or a protein complex, and a red entry represents a negative effect, e.g., the substance or the protein complex can not be produced anymore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fig 1 exemplifies the concept of in silico knockout matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The example PN in Fig 1A describes the synthesis of two proteins, A and B, the binding of these proteins to form a complex, AB, and the outflow of the complex to the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T-invariant consists of the reactions SynA, SynB, Bin, and Out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this example, the syntheses of A (input transition SynA) and B (input transition SynB) are knocked out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting in silico knockout matrix (see Fig 1B) visualizes the influence of these knockouts on A, B, and AB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rows of the matrix represent the input transitions, SynA and SynB, and the columns the substances, A, B, and AB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The knockout of either the syntheses of A (input transition SynA) or B (input transition SynB) is sufficient to have a negative effect on all substances in the model, A, B, and AB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, all entries in the matrix are red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we would expect that the synthesis of protein B has no effect on protein A and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We correct this effect by the addition of output transitions for A and B (see Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biologically, these output transitions, DegA and DegB, represent the degradation of the proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional output transitions generate two new T-invariants, which separately include the synthesis and the degradation of A and B, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first T-invariant consists of the transitions SynA and DegA, and the second T-invariant of SynB and DegB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Now, B is not affected by a knockout of A and vice versa, see Fig 1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concept of sensitivity and in silico knockout matrices is directly related to Mauritius maps, which compute and visualize the impact of knockouts as a binary tree structure [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biological_model_of_Salmonella_xenophagy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We proposed a model of Salmonella xenophagy illustrated in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To get a comprehensive overview of the current state of research, we included all known processes that target Salmonella to xenophagy in epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inside the lumen of the mammalian small intestine, Salmonella infiltrates epithelial cells, see Fig 2 upper part.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once inside the cell, most of the bacteria stay in the SCV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inside the SCV, Salmonella has non-ideal life conditions, such as an acidic environment [29] with limited space and likely nutrient-poor [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small fraction of Salmonella disrupts their vacuolar membrane of the SCV [4, 31], and enters the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inside the cytosol, Salmonella has ideal life conditions, such as access to many nutrients, sufficient space, and a neutral pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, Salmonella replicates inside the cytosol at a higher rate than inside the vacuole [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Petri_net_model_of_Salmonella_xenophagy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PN describes the biological model shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model includes all known processes of Salmonella xenophagy in epithelial cells, which were biochemically proven and published, see S2 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included a hypothetical model of TBK1 activation, suggesting a spatial and temporal regulation of this process, see detailed view in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting PN model of Salmonella xenophagy is available in S1 File.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It comprises 61 places, including nine logical places, and 69 transitions connected by 184 arcs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A graphical representation of the PN model is depicted in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All places and transitions, including their biological description, are listed in S1 and S2 Tables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Places can be proteins (e.g., p62, NDP52, OPTN, TBK1), macromolecular complexes (e.g., S:Gal8, S:Ub:NDP52:OPTN:p62), organisms (S-cyt), or even signals (e.g., SignalSCVdamage, NDP52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The place E3 ligase represents an unknown E3 ubiquitin ligase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ubiquitin and phosphate are not directly modeled as a place in the PN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transitions can be binding processes (e.g., T1, T2, T3), escape from the SCV (T17), degradations (e.g., Deg1, Deg2, Deg2i), damage of the SCV (SCVdamage), or syntheses (Syn1-9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PN has ten input and seven output transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Input transitions stand for the syntheses of proteins or protein complexes (Syn1-9) or the invasion of Salmonella to the cytosol (SCVdamage).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Output transitions are degradations of captured Salmonella inside the autophagosome (e.g., Deg1, Deg2, Deg2i) or degradation of protein complexes (Output).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The temporal order of binding events in Salmonella xenophagy is still unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, it is not known whether Nap1/Sintbad binds to NDP52 followed by a binding of the NDP52-Nap1/Sintbad complex to ubiquitinated Salmonella or whether NDP52 binds to ubiquitinated Salmonella followed by a binding of Nap1/Sintbad to NDP52-positive Salmonella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likely, both temporal orders of binding events are possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We decided to model one of these temporal orders as a typical systems behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To model all possible orders is beyond the scope of this work and would unnecessarily increase the complexity of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The problem of combinatorial complexity emerges because the proteins can be modified and combined in various ways to form multicomponent complexes, reviewed by Hlavacek et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_silico_knockout_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To observe the effect of specific proteins on the network behavior, we performed in silico knockout experiments and compared the results with published experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aim was to check the biological credibility of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model describes 16 different ways of capturing Salmonella for the xenophagy pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we knockout each of the autophagy components, unknown E3 ubiquitin ligase, LRSAM1, galectin-8, p62, NDP52, OPTN, Nap1/Sintbad, or TBK1, all of these 16 ways or even a few could be affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S5 and S6 Tables list the knocked out proteins and their effect on Salmonella xenophagy measured in the percentage of affected T-invariants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 4, the results are visualized in the sensitivity matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knockout analysis showed that only the knockout of NDP52 affects 100% of the T-invariants, resulting in a complete loss of function of both galectin-8 and ubiquitin-dependent xenophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the 16 T-invariants remained functional, which demonstrates the central role of NDP52 in Salmonella xenophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knockout of the E3 ubiquitin ligase LRSAM1, other E3 ubiquitin ligases, and the autophagy receptors, p62 and OPTN, affected 94% of the T-invariants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the galectin-8-dependent xenophagy pathway remained functional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A double knockout of p62 and NDP52 showed a complete loss of function of the galectin-8 and ubiquitin-dependent xenophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with the double knockdown experiment of NDP52 and p62 in HeLa cells [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knockdown of both autophagy receptors caused a reduction of LC3/GABARAP association to Salmonella to a similar extent than the knockdown of one receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A knockout of the kinase TBK1 would affect only 38% of the T-invariants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the model, TBK1 is not absolutely required in xenophagy, but may have an enhancing effect on Salmonella xenophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, TBK1 siRNA-treated HeLa cells show similar Salmonella replication than NDP52 siRNA-treated cells [8, 9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be due to a higher amount of fast-replicating, cytosolic bacteria caused by a reduced vacuolar integrity in TBK1-depleted cells [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To avoid effects as described in Fig 1, we included additional output transitions to generate new T-invariants for the construction of the in silico knockout matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modified PN model is available in S2 File.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5 shows the resulting in silico knockout matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rows of the matrix represent protein knockouts and the columns the effects of the perturbation on macromolecular Salmonella complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The matrix has 200 entries, 41 of those had been experimentally investigated in eight studies [69, 25, 33, 34, 38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12 entries are biologically obvious and need no further experimental investigation, e.g., the knockout of galectin-8 has a negative effect on the binding of galectin-8 to Salmonella inside the damaged SCV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other 147 entries can be interpreted as hypotheses for future investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following, we describe the effect of some knocked out proteins (see Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We constructed a mathematical model, which provides a compilation of currently available experimental findings of Salmonella xenophagy in a verified and consistent network topology of the elementary molecular processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PN model combines the molecular processes of ubiquitination, binding of the autophagy receptors, regulatory processes, like nutrient-dependent regulation of xenophagy, TBK1-dependent activation of the autophagy receptor, OPTN, and galectin-8-dependent xenophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modeling the unknown process of TBK1 activation in HeLa cells, we proposed a new hypothetical model of TBK1 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume a spatial and temporal regulation of this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We checked the model structure for consistencies and correctness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found 16 basic functional modules, which describe different pathways of the autophagic capturing of Salmonella and reflect the basic dynamics of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We introduced a new concept of in silico knockout analyses based on T-Invariants and visualized the results as an in silico knockout matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model correctly reproduces the experimental results published so far, ensuring the biological credibility of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the in silico knockout analyses, we postulate hypotheses for future investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the fact that xenophagy was discovered recently and the exact molecular details are still unknown, the proposed model is probably not complete and will be extended by new insights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If quantitative data become available, the PN model can be easily extended to model the quantitative systems behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
