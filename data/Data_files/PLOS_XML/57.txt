Resolving Conflicts between Agriculture and the Natural Environment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Agriculture dominates the planet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet it has many environmental costs that are unsustainable, especially as global food demand rises.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we evaluate ways in which different parts of the world are succeeding in their attempts to resolve conflict between agriculture and wild nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We envision that coordinated global action in conserving land most sensitive to agricultural activities and policies that internalise the environmental costs of agriculture are needed to deliver a more sustainable future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Agriculture is the most dominant land use on Earth and will remain so as the worlds population and global food demand rise [1] (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This poses a fundamental challenge to the natural environment, which requires access to many of the same resources as agricultural producers and is harmed by agricultures external impacts [2,3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using land resources for agriculture prioritises crop and livestock production over the many other benefits that natural ecosystems provide and that agriculture displaces, including biodiversity, carbon storage, and water purification [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Governments also heavily support agricultural production in ways that are often bad for the environment, such as rewarding output or lowering input prices [5,6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very little is spent on actively mitigating the environmental impacts (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We distinguished between policies aiming to achieve specific environmental objectives beyond those required by regulation (purple segments) and all other types of support irrespective of their influence on farm production or income (orange segments), e.g., market price support, monetary transfers based on output, input subsidies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sizes of symbols were scaled to VoP in hundreds of millions of United States dollars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are from the most recent year available (20082013) and described in S1 Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Green and brown shading in the background is the percent of cropland and pasture at 5 resolution in the year 2000 [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Financial support data were preferentially sourced from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (n = 21 countries), supplemented from the World Trade Organization (WTO) where possible for additional countries (n = 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data used to make this figure are provided in S1 Data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Here, we summarise how agriculture impacts the natural environment and then scrutinise the success of government agricultural policies that we believe offer the most promise for safeguarding nature while feeding a growing human population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use economic and political theory to help explain why some measures are more prone to succeed than others, recognising that scientific understanding of a problem does not mean it will be solved [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout, we touch upon examples from centres of agricultural production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Cultivated_Planet  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Agricultures demand for land drives conversion of natural habitats, and this is arguably its largest environmental cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 40% of ice-free land (4,300 million ha) is already covered by crops or used to raise livestock [7], and an additional 2.74.9 million ha of cropland annually, the size of a small European nation, may be required to feed the worlds population by 2030 [1,9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversion of land for agriculture is estimated to account for 80% of global deforestation [10], and ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53% of terrestrial species assessed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [11] are negatively impacted by agriculture (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Land conversion also reduces the size of the terrestrial carbon sink.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global simulation models predict that 24% and 10% less carbon is stored in vegetation and soil, respectively, than if present-day landscapes retained their natural vegetation [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We counted the total number of species classified as either critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable by the IUCN Red List in different taxonomic units and the number that were assessed to be threatened by at least one agricultural activity [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Agricultural activities were annual and perennial nontimber crops, wood and pulp plantations, livestock farming and ranching, logging and wood harvesting, abstracting of surface water (agricultural use), abstraction of ground water (agricultural use), and agricultural and forestry effluents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many other species may become threatened with agricultural expansion (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002242.g002  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Agriculture also contributes more to other forms of environmental degradation than any other economic sector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 30%35% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions come from agriculture [3], and crop irrigation accounts for 70% of the worlds freshwater withdrawals [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser has increased nearly 21-fold since 1950, and more nitrogen is now added to agricultural soils than from natural processes [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virtually all human-derived nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere or receiving waters [14,15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This eutrophication suffocates aquatic ecosystems [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorus from fertiliser and livestock manure [14,17], pesticides [1820], and nanoparticles [21,22] are also exacerbating environmental pollution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, poor agricultural management causes soil degradation, reducing agricultural productivity and creating further demand for nutrients, water, and land conversion [23,24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Solutions for limiting agricultures environmental costs are increasingly well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include reducing land clearance by improving yields of existing crops, minimizing excess nutrient and water use, and shifting production from livestock towards crops [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Implementing these practices for only a handful of commodities in a subset of the world can have a large environmental benefit [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The success of these practices, however, depends on how well policy puts them into practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Challenges_to_Limiting_Agriculture_s_Environmental_Costs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Designing and implementing policies to reduce agricultures environmental costs is difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like other industries, farmers and the businesses reliant upon them, such as input suppliers, processors, and retailers, have a rational self-interest in maximising economic returns and oppose policies that threaten their viability [26,27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In developed economies, this has historically allowed them to organise into focused lobby groups with considerable advantage over diffuse public interests seeking to safeguard the environment [28,29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Governments rarely benefit from challenging agri-food lobbies over environmental issues that lack immediate returns for the public good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lobbies reward government for less demanding environmental policies [30,31], and tailoring policies appropriate for the range of physical and social conditions that farms occupy is costly [26,27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concerns about foodborne illness (including genetically modified organisms), environmental impacts (e.g., pesticide use), and animal welfare have ceded some power in the policy arena of developed countries from producers to consumers [32], and increasingly to large retailers, but existing governance structures remain highly susceptible to farmer interests despite spatiotemporal variation in power relations [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, corporate lobbying efforts in the agricultural sector were deemed effective by 52% of respondents in a 2013 survey of nearly 600 European Union (EU) decision makers, and  greater than 80% effectiveness was reported in Denmark, Latvia, and the United Kingdom [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Policymakers therefore face major challenges in aligning the private interests of the agri-food sector with public interest in environmental goods across the diversity and extent of farm entities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to political challenges, measures that do succeed in reducing the environmental harms of agriculture in one place can perversely increase them elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because, in a global market, local policies or technologies that cause agricultural production to carry a greater opportunity cost than using land for environmental goods will displace production to regions where these costs are lower [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, regulations limiting fertilisers can reduce local water pollution and GHG emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But because such measures may reduce yields (i.e., tonnage of production per unit area), food demand will be met elsewhere, leading to intensification and land clearance that potentially creates a net environmental loss [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incentivising low-intensity systems, seen as beneficial to biodiversity conservation in regions such as Europe, may similarly limit production and displace environmental impacts while also lacking the full benefits of natural ecosystems [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts to limit the environmental costs of agriculture must therefore consider the environmental impacts beyond farm boundaries as well as the consequences for food production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Potential_Resolutions_to_the_AgricultureNature_Conflict  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Agricultural policy with explicit environmental objectives is generally organized around three approaches (Table 1 and expanded upon in S1 Table; see Box 1 for an exception):  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002242.t001  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Farmers will be motivated to accept one or more of these approaches where they incur small socioeconomic costs relative to the benefits that they receive from achieving environmental objectives [37,38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eliminating financial support for farmers to maximise agricultural production is important in helping to reduce the socioeconomic costs of adopting environmental practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reforms in developed economies since the 1980s are now supporting producer incomes more through direct payments than by subsidising production or protecting domestic prices [2,39] (Box 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even with farmer acceptance, success of any policy approach will ultimately depend on whether farmers maintain or boost yields on existing agricultural lands rather than convert new natural lands to production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Halting local land conversion can be achieved with strict enforced regulations (Table 1), but in a globalized market, changes in the local supply of a given cash crop will lead to changes in demand and supply in other distant locations [59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trends in cereal production in 19 countries between 1990 and 2005 clearly show this link between local actions and global consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These countries managed to boost cereal yields on existing lands while removing cropland from production, but without fully meeting local demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Per capita cereal imports consequently increased by 12-fold in these countries compared with those lacking land retirement policies [60], clearly suggesting that production was displaced elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where subsistence agriculture is important, limiting its local production may similarly boost reliance on cash crops produced abroad [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  National governments implementing any of the three main policy approaches need to begin working in a coordinated way to combat land use displacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finding_the_Right_Mixture_of_Solutions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maintaining the status quo with agricultural policy is unsustainable for the environment [3,35,62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On their own, regulations and community approaches will offer little help if damaging the environment remains financially lucrative because the associated penalties are trivial, governments continue to subsidise production (Fig 1, S1 Fig), and farmers are not accountable for the environmental costs of their actions [6365] (Box 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Economic instruments, such as payments for public goods, are also contentious, especially for biodiversity conservation [6668].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive outcomes often arise only from certain actions, such as enhancing specific food resources or nesting habitat [69], and catch-all interventions may avoid targeting rare species [70,71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removing production subsidies and making farmers financially responsible for their environmental impacts, such as with markets for public goods, can help local outcomes but must avoid curbing intensification because this will encourage land conversion elsewhere to meet demand for food [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assert that conflict between agriculture and the environment will be best resolved by policies dedicating high-quality habitat towards nature conservation, while encouraging intensive production on existing farmland with stringent limits on environmental impacts [35,36,7981].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measures that make farmland itself more benignso called land-sharing approachesalso deliver local environmental and social benefits [82,83], but can reduce agricultural yields and cause land conversion elsewhere, effectively displacing environmental burdens [80].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensifying production on existing farmland may thus be a better option because it avoids displacing impacts and can allow other land to be freed for nature conservation and restoration, with no net loss in agricultural production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our consideration of policy instruments approaches and the obstacles to their success (Table 1) suggests that our proposed resolution would practically entail a combination of punitive measures, such as taxes that reduce existing overuse of farm inputs [84], with positive incentives linked to measurable outcomes [49], such as for permanently removing land from production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taxes on farm inputs can improve upon existing payments to limit input use because they do not explicitly cap nutrient, pesticide, and water use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without input limits, some farmers may find it profitable to intensify existing production, despite the added taxes, while others might profit more from reducing resource consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across the landscape, yields will be maintained, and potentially increased without additional land conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, water surcharges in Mexico are used to pay landowners to retain forested watersheds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Displaced land conversion from exploitation of communal properties and changing market pressures reduced the environmental benefits of this programme by only ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4% [85].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By enabling farms to respond differently to the same policy, input taxes carry an additional advantage over traditional regulations that hold all farmers to the same standard and ignore sectorial diversity [86].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An aligned but more audacious approach would be to replace taxes on income with taxes on environmental consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idea is to shift from taxing the production of private wealth toward taxing the consumption of public environmental goods, thus promoting economic growth from sustainable use rather than depletion of natural capital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brown et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [55] have proposed that such a system would most heavily tax intensive land uses that generate the most negative environmental impacts, while areas of intact ecological function would entitle the owners to a rebate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach might encourage farmers to work intensively with the most productive land but set aside and restore less productive areas with net gains for the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evidence at national levels suggests that investments in land retirement and input-limiting schemes, consistent with our suggested policy approach, do deliver local environmental benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illustrate this, we examined trends in two environmental responses, farmland bird populations and GHG emissions from synthetic fertilisers, across countries with similar agricultural patterns, i.e., dominated by livestock and arable crops (see S1 Text for methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the annual, per hectare monetary investment in a specific environmental outcome beyond that required by regulation from a detailed inventory of government policies compiled by the OECD (annotated in S1 Data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, because habitat loss is a major threat to farmland and grassland biota, we found that farmland birds benefited as more money was invested in retiring agricultural land (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that total emissions of N2O declined with increasing investment in reducing fertiliser use (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While cursory in nature, these results suggest that targeted policies have the potential to deliver positive environmental outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measures delivering environmental benefits must also be coupled with mechanisms that promote intensification to avoid displacing production elsewhere, and they must do so with fewer external costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research suggests increased yields and better environmental practices are possible by improving nutrient and water management and breeding more efficient crops [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reductions in food waste and human diets with less livestock and dairy consumption can also help meet rising food demands without increasing resource use [89,90].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dietary change is, however, contentious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Governments may need to consider policies that tax livestock products and/or subsidize the development of livestock-free protein sources, e.g., [91], in order to dislodge entrenched norms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we have laid out a vision for limiting the environmental impacts of agriculture, yet at least two major challenges remain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, winning political support for policy change remains a fundamental requirement to any of our proposed reforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, democratically elected governments, while not immune to the lobbying power of agribusiness, will generally respond to electoral pressures [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electorates may express little desire for policy change if they are poorly informed, unmotivated, or misled by industry about limiting the environmental costs of agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, implementation of our policy mixture will vary spatially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, successful land retirement depends on features of the surrounding landscape, such as habitat connectivity [92], and can reduce yields in regions where the most productive land also has the most valuable environmental assets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, improvements in the management of land resources in developing countries [93], new technologies that optimally allocate farm inputs to reduce overuse [94], advances in crop breeding [95], and tools for better conservation planning [96] give us hope that innovations exist for meeting the need for more sustainable and intensive agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
