Comparing efficacies of moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin in tuberculosis granulomas using a multi-scale systems pharmacology approach  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Granulomas are complex lung lesions that are the hallmark of tuberculosis (TB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding antibiotic dynamics within lung granulomas will be vital to improving and shortening the long course of TB treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three fluoroquinolones (FQs) are commonly prescribed as part of multi-drug resistant TB therapy: moxifloxacin (MXF), levofloxacin (LVX) or gatifloxacin (GFX).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, insufficient data are available to support selection of one FQ over another, or to show that these drugs are clinically equivalent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To predict the efficacy of MXF, LVX and GFX at a single granuloma level, we integrate computational modeling with experimental datasets into a single mechanistic framework, GranSim.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GranSim is a hybrid agent-based computational model that simulates granuloma formation and function, FQ plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and is based on extensive in vitro and in vivo data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treat in silico granulomas with recommended daily doses of each FQ and compare efficacy by multiple metrics: bacterial load, sterilization rates, early bactericidal activity and efficacy under non-compliance and treatment interruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GranSim reproduces in vivo plasma pharmacokinetics, spatial and temporal tissue pharmacokinetics and in vitro pharmacodynamics of these FQs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predict that MXF kills intracellular bacteria more quickly than LVX and GFX due in part to a higher cellular accumulation ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that all three FQs struggle to sterilize non-replicating bacteria residing in caseum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to modest drug concentrations inside caseum and high inhibitory concentrations for this bacterial subpopulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MXF and LVX have higher granuloma sterilization rates compared to GFX; and MXF performs better in a simulated non-compliance or treatment interruption scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that MXF has a small but potentially clinically significant advantage over LVX, as well as LVX over GFX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We illustrate how a systems pharmacology approach combining experimental and computational methods can guide antibiotic selection for TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and kills 1.5 million people each year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TB requires at least 6 months of treatment with up to four drugs, and is characterized by formation of granulomas in patient lungs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Granulomas are spherical collections of host cells and bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a class of drug that could help shorten TB treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three FQs that are used to treat TB are: moxifloxacin (MXF), levofloxacin (LVX) or gatifloxacin (GFX).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, it is unclear if one FQ is better than the others at treating TB, in part because little is known about how these drugs distribute and work inside the lung granulomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use computer simulations of Mtb infection and FQ treatment within granulomas to predict which FQ is better and why.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our computer model is calibrated to multiple experimental data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare the three FQs by multiple metrics, and predict that MXF is better than LVX and GFX because it kills bacteria more quickly, and it works better when patients miss doses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, all three FQs are unable to kill a part of the bacterial population living in the center of granulomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results can now inform future experimental studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global public health threat killing 1.5 million people annually [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite our arsenal of anti-TB antibiotics, effective treatment remains a challenge, requiring at least 6 months of combination therapy with up to four antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One obstacle to refining TB treatment is complex granuloma structures that develop in patient lungs following infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Granulomas are dense collections of host immune cells, bacteria and dead host cell debris (caseum); and can be cellular (without caseum), caseous, fibrotic or suppurative (containing neutrophils in the core) [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Granulomas isolate Mtb, enhance Mtb replication and provide a potential barrier for antibiotic penetration [3, 4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a class of antibiotics typically used as second-line agents against multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) [5], or as preventive therapy for MDR-TB contacts [6, 7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of three FQs is used in MDR-TB treatment: moxifloxacin (MXF), levofloxacin (LVX) or gatifloxacin (GFX).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choice of one FQ over another is essentially motivated by availability, cost and national guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WHO recommends use of LVX over MXF, and MXF over GFX [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of comparative clinical trials other than early bactericidal activity [8], there are not sufficient data to declare that treatment with one FQ results in superior clinical outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying the best FQ will require careful study of antibiotic dynamics and activity in granulomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent studies have characterized pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) metrics of MXF, LVX and GFX (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variety of mixed and conflicting data make it unclear whether one FQ is optimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, PK metrics alone indicate: LVX and GFX have higher plasma exposure (area under the concentration curve (AUC)), and MXF has higher concentrations in epithelial lung fluid or alveolar macrophages [9, 10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examining PD metrics, GFX has lower MIC against intracellular Mtb, MXF and GFX have equivalent MICs against Mtb grown in liquid culture, MXF has higher bactericidal activity compared to LVX, and MXF and GFX can prevent resistance at lower concentrations than LVX [1114].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to clinical metrics, LVX has higher early bactericidal activity (EBA, daily decrease in sputum bacterial burden) (day 0 to 2), all three FQs have equivalent extended EBA (day 2 to 7), and MXF and LVX perform similarly on sputum culture conversion after 3 months, time to sputum culture conversion, and treatment success rate [8, 1518].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these existing data it is not clear whether one FQ should be preferred for treatment of TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The ability of an antibiotic to successfully treat TB depends on complex interactions along its path from dose, to plasma, to granuloma to bacterium [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibiotic concentrations in the blood determine how much antibiotic is available for distribution into granulomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibiotics diffuse from blood vessels into lung tissue and granulomas, where spatial distribution is affected by uptake into host-cells, binding to caseum, and location of functional blood vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once an antibiotic reaches bacteria, it must penetrate the bacterial cell wall and reach the molecular target in sufficient concentration to kill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complicating things further is inter-individual host variability in plasma pharmacokinetics and lung pathology (lesion type) that must be considered when predicting antibiotic efficacy in TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both experimental and computational studies can be useful to identify antibiotic regimens that will effectively treat TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments can quantify antibiotic concentrations, spatial distributions, in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy in animal models or as part of background regimens in humans (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computational approaches can combine datasets from multiple experimental systems, interpolate between experimental data points, and screen large numbers of treatment regimens more time- and cost-effectively [2022].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we take a systems pharmacology approach, integrating state-of-the-art experimental and computational methods to predict FQ efficacy and compare FQs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present a spatio-temporal computational model of granuloma formation, function and treatment that is calibrated to an exhaustive experimental dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data include FQ dynamics in blood plasma, spatial and temporal distribution in granulomas, and activity in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our hybrid computational model, GranSim, tracks events at multiple spatial scales (molecular, cellular and tissue) and time scales (seconds to months).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our systems pharmacology approach provides a unique format for predicting, at a single granuloma level, the potential effects of these three different FQs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Computational_model_integrates_experimental_fluoroquinolone_dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To predict and compare FQ efficacy in granulomas we use our mechanistic computational model, GranSim (Fig 1) [2326].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GranSim is a spatio-temporal model of granuloma formation and function that incorporates macrophage and T cell recruitment, migration and interaction; secretion and diffusion of chemokines and cytokines; Mtb growth and phagocytosis; and caseation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of these in silico granulomas, GranSim simulates antibiotic plasma PK, tissue PK and PD [2022].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GranSim is implemented as in [2022] with three updates made in this work: 1) inclusion of fluoroquinolone dynamics (previous versions include only isoniazid and rifampin); 2) dynamic representation of cellular uptake of antibiotics (previous versions assume pseudo-steady state); and 3) antibiotic binding to caseum and normal lung tissue (previous versions approximate binding by using effective diffusivity parameters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes were necessary for model calibration to experimental FQ data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimate GranSim parameters by calibrating to plasma PK, tissue PK, and PD data from in vitro and rabbit studies performed in this work, and from human studies described in the literature (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasma PK model within GranSim reproduces rabbit plasma concentrations of FQs (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GranSim captures temporal concentration measurements in homogenized cellular and caseous rabbit granulomas (Fig 3), as well as qualitative differences in the spatial distribution of the FQs (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PD parameters reproduce in vitro dose response curves specific to different bacterial subpopulations (intracellular, extracellular replicating or extracellular non-replicating) (Figure in S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters used for simulations are listed in Table 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interesting comparisons between the FQs emerge from the calibrated model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma PK suggest higher peak concentrations of LVX and GFX (Fig 2), and faster inter-compartmental clearance for MXF (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to plasma PK, data from homogenized granulomas reveal higher MXF peak concentrations compared to GFX and LVX (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding that MXF peak concentrations are lower in plasma and higher in granulomas compared to GFX and LVX highlights the need for more detailed PK studies in granulomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial distribution of FQs in rabbit and simulated granulomas reveal: poor penetration of GFX and MXF into caseum compared to LVX, GFX accumulation in cellular areas immediately surrounding caseum, and more evenly distributed MXF accumulation in cellular areas of granulomas (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These spatial data suggest that average concentrations in homogenized granulomas might not represent antibiotic dynamics at specific locations where bacteria reside, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  caseum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PD parameter values show that MXF and GFX have similar C50 values (concentration where 50% of maximum activity is achieved), while LVX has higher C50 values against both intracellular and extracellular Mtb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model parameters also provide insight into the mechanisms behind FQ spatial distribution and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue PK parameter values indicate that: higher penetration of LVX into caseum is due to higher effective diffusivity in granulomas and slightly lower binding to caseum; accumulation of MXF in cellular areas is due to higher uptake into host cells; and GFX accumulation around caseum is due to slightly faster binding to caseum compared to MXF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PD parameter values indicate that MXF, LVX and GFX all have steep dose response curves, suggesting that these drugs would have very little effect at sub-C50 concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Integration of multiple datasets ensures that our computational model captures spatial and temporal in vivo dynamics, while being consistent with in vitro and literature observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predictions for FQ efficacy in granulomas are now possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, is better penetration of LVX into the caseum able to overcome its higher C50 values (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are spatial granuloma PK differences relevant in the context of PD differences)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Is the higher concentration of MXF in granulomas able to overcome its poor relative penetration into caseum (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are spatial granuloma PK differences relevant in the context of temporal PK differences)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use our systems pharmacology model to address these questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spatial_fluoroquinolone_distribution_in_rabbit_granulomas_is_representative_of_distribution_in_humans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before predicting FQ efficacy we explore how human vs. rabbit plasma PK affects the distribution of FQs in granulomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are notable differences in FQ plasma PK between rabbits and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To predict if human plasma PK would affect the observed spatial distribution of FQs within granulomas, we simulate treatment using human plasma PK parameters that we fit to existing data [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameter differences between rabbit and human data suggest faster absorption and slower clearance of all three FQs in humans compared to rabbits (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial distributions in simulated granulomas are similar when using human or rabbit plasma PK parameters (Figure in S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temporal differences in granulomas reflect differences in plasma PK between rabbits and humans, most notably more antibiotic accumulation within granulomas at 24 hours post dose with human plasma PK compared to rabbit plasma PK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a result of slower plasma clearance in humans (Table 3), resulting in slower movement of FQs out of the lung tissue into blood following peak concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the qualitative spatial distribution of FQs is relatively insensitive to plasma PK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our simulations suggests that the rabbit model provides an accurate representation of FQ spatial distribution within human granulomas if the granulomas are similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MXF_has_small_efficacy_advantages_over_LVX__and_LVX_over_GFX  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare FQ efficacy, we simulate 6 months of daily therapy with each FQ in a collection of 210 in silico granulomas, starting at day 380 post-infection, using human plasma PK parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the following metrics to quantify FQ efficacy: bacterial load per granuloma during and after treatment, percentage of granulomas sterilized and time to sterilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also characterize FQ treatment in terms of immune responses within granulomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial load per granuloma during and after treatment is similar for MXF and LVX (Fig 5A), with higher bacterial load following GFX treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all three FQs, treatment responses comprise a sharp initial decline followed by a slower decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This biphasic response is widely observed during TB therapy [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluating the response of specific bacterial subpopulations to treatment reveals that MXF sterilizes the intracellular bacterial subpopulation more quickly than LVX and GFX (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracellular replicating subpopulation is effectively sterilized (falling below an average of 1 bacterium per granuloma) within 10 to 13 days by all three FQs (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-replicating subpopulation (residing in the caseum) shows a very slow decline for all three FQs (Fig 5D), and is responsible for the second phase in the biphasic kill curve in Fig 5A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Besides FQ effects on bacterial load within granulomas, we can also track immunological changes within granulomas during treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon infection, macrophages in the lung are activated in response to inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IFN-) and/or the presence of bacteria [2931].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, computational and non-human primate studies have shown that a balance between concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNF-) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-10) is an important determinant in controlling bacterial growth in granulomas while limiting tissue damage [23, 32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of activated macrophages and the ratio of TNF- concentration to IL-10 concentration in our simulation is therefore used as two metrics of inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inflammation metrics reflect the predicted bacterial differences between the FQs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MXF sterilizes the intracellular population more quickly than LVX and GFX, thereby eliminating infected macrophages, which are important drivers of host inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, numbers of activated macrophages and ratio of TNF- concentration to IL-10 concentration both decline more quickly during MXF treatment compared to LVX and GFX (Fig 5E and 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other metrics of inflammation (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  number of activated cytotoxic or IFN-producing T cells) show little differences between FQs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that bacterial killing by immune mechanisms continue to play a role during GFX and LVX treatment, and are less prominent during MXF treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The FQ concentration experienced by each of the bacterial subpopulations (Fig 6) reveals the cause for the observed bacterial load dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular bacteria are exposed to concentrations above C50,BI for more than half of the dosing period for MXF, but not LVX or GFX (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extracellular replicating bacteria are exposed to FQ concentrations well in excess of their effective concentrations throughout most of the dosing period (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predict that non-replicating subpopulations see concentrations ~3-fold lower than their effective concentrations (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Time to sterilization and percentage of granulomas sterilized are captured by Kaplan-Meier curves (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations predict that MXF and LVX sterilize significantly higher percentages of granulomas compared to GFX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on these data we conclude that the three FQs are similar, with MXF having a slight advantage over LVX (faster intracellular killing), and LVX a slight advantage over GFX (more granulomas sterilized).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Uncertainty_analysis_supports_predicted_advantages_of_MXF_over_LVX_and_GFX  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the effect of parameter uncertainty on our efficacy predictions, we quantify the effect of individual parameters on model outputs, as described in Sensitivity Analysis in Methods and in [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we simultaneously sample all antibiotic parameters in ranges spanning values for the three FQs (Table in S2 Table), and calculate partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCCs) between each parameter and model output (Table in S3 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous results [20], PRCCs reveal that plasma PK parameters (plasma clearance rate constant, CL), tissue PK parameters (cellular accumulation ratio, a, and permeability coefficient, PC) and PD parameters (maximum intracellular activity, Emax,BI, and C50 for intracellular Mtb, C50,BI) are drivers of infection and inflammation in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outputs driven by these parameters include: bacterial load, macrophage activation, T cell activation, and TNF- and IL-10 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is relatively low uncertainty in the plasma and tissue PK parameters, since they are estimated from calibration to multiple in vitro and in vivo data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PRCCs indicate that uncertainty in intracellular PD parameters influences model outputs, while extracellular and non-replicating PD parameters do not (Table in S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is expected based on the concentration profiles in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular bacteria are exposed to antibiotic concentrations close to the measured ranges for C50,BI, and therefore uncertainty in these values would affect predicted efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  if the in vivo C50,BI values are significantly higher or lower than the in vitro measured values, the intracellular bacterial population would have a more or less significant role, respectively, in the long-term bacterial response to treatment in our simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is not currently possible to directly measure intracellular PD parameters in vivo, and we therefore rely on in vitro measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of these parameters in our efficacy predictions highlight the need for controlled in vivo efficacy studies that would allow for indirect estimation of PD parameters through calibration of bacterial loads to per-granuloma experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, unless one FQs PD parameters are more sensitive to in vitro conditions than the others, our conclusion of MXF having an advantage over LVX and GFX should still hold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bacterial_subpopulation-specific_simulated_EBA_reflects_clinical_sputum_EBA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EBA, defined as the daily decrease in sputum bacterial burden measured in colony forming units (CFU), is frequently used to assess the efficacy of a single drug in the first 7 or 14 days of treatment in clinical trials [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we introduce a new term: in silico EBA, which is defined as the daily decrease in simulated bacterial burden per granuloma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In silico EBA is also calculated for individual bacterial subpopulations, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the in silico intracellular EBA is the daily decrease in simulated intracellular bacteria per granuloma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to clinical EBA measured from sputum [8], in silico EBA is lower for all three FQs (Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is expected since our model tracks all bacteria in granulomas, whereas sputum samples contain a subpopulation of bacteria that may not fully represent the population in granulomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy between Mtb found in sputum vs. granulomas has been implicated in the poor ability of clinical sputum EBA to predict sterilization and long-term treatment outcomes [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In silico intracellular and extracellular replicating EBA more closely resemble clinical sputum EBA, compared to in silico non-replicating EBA, suggesting that intracellular and extracellular replicating subpopulations could be enriched in sputum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in agreement with human data showing high proportions of intracellular bacteria in sputum [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In silico intracellular EBA confirms that MXF is more efficacious than GFX and LVX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three FQs have similar EBA against extracellular and non-replicating bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MXF_treatment_is_more_efficacious_during_patient_non-compliance_and_treatment_interruption  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With any TB treatment there is a risk of patient non-compliance (inconsistent dosing throughout the treatment period) or treatment interruption (incomplete treatment), often arising from side effects and long treatment duration [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that both bacterial load and host immune responses decline more quickly during MXF treatment, compared to LVX and GFX treatment (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the question: is MXF treatment more sensitive to non-compliance or treatment interruption due to lower immune responses?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Or, is the bacterial population sufficiently controlled by the antibiotic such that the lower inflammatory response does not affect infection control, even during non-compliance or treatment interruption?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We predict the efficacy of each FQ during non-compliance by simulating 6 months of daily therapy with random skipping of 20% of the doses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This threshold is chosen because it is commonly used to define patients as compliant in clinical trials [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial load after treatment shows increases under non-compliance conditions for GFX, MXF and LVX therapy, relative to full compliance (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, bacterial loads during non-compliant MXF and LVX treatment is lower than fully compliant GFX treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kaplan-Meier curves comparing each FQ in the compliant vs. non-compliant scenario show noticeable, but statistically insignificant, differences for LVX and MXF (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, percentage of granulomas sterilized during non-compliant conditions for MXF (18%) and LVX (20%) treatments is still higher than during fully compliant GFX treatment (13%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These small differences at the granuloma level could manifest as clinically significant if we consider that each patient likely has multiple granulomas [2, 39, 40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if a single granuloma has a 5% probability of failing treatment, a person with 10 granulomas has a 40% probability of failing treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in non-human primates indicate they have on average 46 granulomas [41], so this is a significant factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We predict the efficacy of each FQ under treatment interruption by simulating 10 or 70 days of daily treatment, after which we stop treatment for the rest of the 6-month period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We choose 10 days based on clinical studies suggesting that treatment interruptions start increasing around 2 weeks of treatment [42], and our earlier results suggest that differences in immune response and bacterial load is most pronounced at this time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We choose 70 days for late interruption simulation time because at that point the immunological differences between FQs have largely disappeared (Fig 5E and 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial load shows sharp increases following interruption of GFX and LVX treatment, and a return to the pre-treatment trajectory for all bacterial subpopulations (Fig 10A10D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, while interruption of MXF treatment results in an increase in all bacterial subpopulations, the increase is slower and the infection follows a slowed trajectory compared to pre-treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can visualize the opposing forces of infection and immune responses by defining an immune score (a collective metric of immune response) and an infection score (a collective metric of infection severity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immune score is defined as: (Activated macrophages* + Activated IFN--producing T cells* + Activated cytotoxic T cells* + concentration of free TNF- *)/4; where * indicates that the value is normalized to its value at the start of treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the infection score is defined as: (Infected macrophages * + Chronically Infected macrophages * + Extracellular Replicating Mtb* + Extracellular Nonreplicating Mtb*)/4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracking the immune and infection scores throughout treatment (Fig 10E and 10F) indicates that although the immune response is weaker during MXF treatment, it is sufficient to control the significantly reduced bacterial population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If treatment is interrupted after 70 days, the immune score and infection score remain stable following MXF and LVX interruption, while GFX interruption results in a slight increase in infection score (Table in S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on our in silico predictions that MXF-treated granulomas have lower bacterial loads and lower levels of treatment failure during non-compliance and treatment interruption, MXF is recommended over LVX and GFX in patients deemed at high risk of non-compliance or treatment interruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are a number of new anti-TB antibiotics and antibiotic regimens in development and in various stages of clinical testing [43, 44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To maximize the useful lifespan of new and existing antibiotics, we need to optimize their implementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficacy of any antibiotic depends on a combination of factors (Table 1), and in a nonlinear and often non-intuitive way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complexity stems from granuloma pathology, host dynamics, pathogen interactions and drug properties [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systems pharmacology approaches that combine host, pathogen and antibiotic dynamics are ideal tools to study these complexities in a single model system, and are valuable in identifying promising treatment regimens to advance to animal and clinical studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use a systems pharmacology approach to compare efficacy of three FQs in TB granulomas, concluding that MXF has a small but potentially clinically significant advantage over LVX, and LVX over GFX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MXF outperforms LVX and GFX in terms of total bacterial load, EBA and efficacy during non-compliance and treatment interruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MXF and LVX each outperform GFX in terms of time to granuloma sterilization as well as percentage of granulomas sterilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We would therefore recommend MXF over LVX, and LVX over GFX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our predictions are currently being tested in rabbit models of TB, and will inform future studies in non-human primates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies will also be used to refine estimates of important in vivo intracellular PD parameters for future simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results could help guide FQ selection for MDR treatment as well as for future clinical trials for drug sensitive TB treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to recommendations for future treatment and trials, our work also provides insight into clinical trial results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent phase III clinical trials explored the possibility of using MXF or GFX to shorten the 6-month treatment regimens prescribed for drug-sensitive TB [4547].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three trials failed to show non-inferiority compared to the standard 6-month regimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, preclinical results in mouse models of TB showed FQs can improve cure rates [48, 49] or bactericidal activity over shorter time scales [50, 51].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase II clinical studies showed a larger decline in sputum bacterial load when FQs are substituted into the standard regimen [18, 52, 53], but the 8 week time points evaluated in these phase II studies did not predict long term outcomes such as sterilization and recurrence that appeared in the phase III studies [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our computational approach could explain why MXF and GFX failed to improve treatment outcomes in these 4-month regimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In previous studies we found that granulomas that fail to sterilize with INH and RIF treatment contain mostly intracellular and non-replicating Mtb [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results here indicate that GFX and MXF would be unable to sterilize the non-replicating bacterial subpopulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that MXF and GFX would be complementary to INH or RIF in the tested 4-month regimens by targeting the intracellular populations not eliminated by INH or RIF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the non-replicating populations that survive INH or RIF in the 4-month regimens would still persist in the context of MXF or GFX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results therefore predict that non-inferiority of these 4-month regimens could be due to non-replicating bacteria that persist throughout therapy, contributing to subsequent relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Toward the goal of optimizing TB treatment regimens that rely on multiple drugs, in future simulations we will explore the performance of these FQs in combination with INH and/or RIF and other anti-TB antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combination therapy presents a number of challenges that can be studied using computational approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of our method to track responses of different bacterial subpopulations to treatment will allow us to design and optimize combination therapies that effectively target all bacterial subpopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One particular challenge we can address is predicting the risk of effective monotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effective monotherapy occurs when spatial or temporal windows of monotherapy arise, even under combination therapy, due to PK differences between the antibiotics given and could lead to inadvertent selection of drug resistant bacteria [19, 54, 55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond windows of effective monotherapy, optimizing multi-drug therapy is complicated by drug-drug interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inherent properties of antibiotics (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  how they are metabolized) can result in complex networks of interaction (synergy/antagonism)[56, 57] that also influence the selection of drug resistant bacteria [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While such detailed interaction networks are not currently available for Mtb, work in Mycobacterium marinum [57] could inform future optimization studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We predict that FQ concentrations inside granulomas must be at least 3-fold higher than those simulated here to eliminate the non-replicating bacterial population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed simulations with higher doses predict granuloma sterilization within 20 days (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These doses would likely result in toxicity [59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeted or inhaled drug delivery strategies could be used to increase the concentration within granulomas while lowering systemic distribution and therefore toxicity [22, 60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, PK of antibiotics after release from such targeted delivery vehicles determines the feasibility of such approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we previously predicted that INH is suitable for inhaled delivery, but RIFs PK would require unrealistically high carrier loadings [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is difficult to anticipate whether inhaled delivery would be a feasible alternative to oral dosing for FQs based on their plasma and tissue PK parameters derived here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies would have to systematically explore the delivery vehicle parameter space to answer this question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EBA is a treatment outcome metric commonly used to compare antibiotic efficacy in early clinical trials, but the EBA has a poor ability to predict sterilization and long-term treatment outcomes [35, 61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inability of bacterial load measurements in sputum to capture bacterial dynamics inside granulomas is supported by our model results that show lower in silico EBA compared to clinical sputum EBA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systems pharmacology approaches could help extend the impact of EBA studies by predicting underlying bacterial dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As with all computational models, the necessary assumptions made in our model place limitations on the predictions presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the complexity of the system, the model has a large number of parameters that are known with varying degrees of certainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When possible, we increase our confidence in parameter values by fitting to multiple experimental datasets (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LCMS and MALDI-MSI to estimate diffusivity) and by including inter-individual variation in the calibration and prediction simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo efficacy studies can assess the effect of these limitations on our current predictions, and help lessen these effects for future predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Systems pharmacology provides a platform to integrate sometimes-conflicting experimental data with computational modeling to further our understanding of PK/PD interactions in an in vivo setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also allows us to narrow the design space of combinations of drugs to better determine optimal treatments for patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have focused on FQs, but the approach can be applied in any setting of drug distributions in specific tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In TB, multiple drug regimens are used for long periods of time and thus the next necessary step to increasing our understanding is to perform virtual clinical trials that will allow us to predict the right combinations of drugs to shorten treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Parameters used in the model are known with varying degrees of certainty depending on the process that the parameters describe and if this process is experimentally measurable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimation of specific parameters is discussed in more detail below, but briefly we take a combination of the following approaches:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A summary of experimental data and how they are integrated into our computational framework is given in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sensitivity_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the influence of individual antibiotic parameters on model outcomes, we perform a sensitivity analysis (SA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sample all antibiotic parameters simultaneously and uniformly using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) [33, 69, 70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters and ranges used for SA are listed in Table in S2 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters were sampled 400 times, and each set of parameters was simulated in six unique granulomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations consisted of daily treatment between 380 and 410 days post infection with a dose of 400 mg/kg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model sensitivity is quantified using Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC) between model parameters and model outputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model outputs are averaged over the six granulomas tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A p-value less_than 0.01 is considered significant for PRCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
