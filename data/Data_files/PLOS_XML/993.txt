Genetic Variation in the Social Environment Contributes to Health and Disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assessing the impact of the social environment on health and disease is challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As social effects are in part determined by the genetic makeup of social partners, they can be studied from associations between genotypes of one individual and phenotype of another (social genetic effects, SGE, also called indirect genetic effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the first time we quantified the contribution of SGE to more than 100 organismal phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression measured in laboratory mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that genetic variation in cage mates (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SGE) contributes to variation in organismal and molecular measures related to anxiety, wound healing, immune function, and body weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Social genetic effects explained up to 29% of phenotypic variance, and for several traits their contribution exceeded that of direct genetic effects (effects of an individuals genotypes on its own phenotype).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show that ignoring SGE can severely bias estimates of direct genetic effects (heritability).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus SGE may be an important source of missing heritability in studies of complex traits in human populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our study uncovers an important contribution of the social environment to phenotypic variation, sets the basis for using SGE to dissect social effects, and identifies an opportunity to improve studies of direct genetic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Daily interactions between individuals can influence their health both in positive and negative ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Often the mechanisms mediating social effects are unknown, so current approaches to study social effects are limited to a few phenotypes for which the mediating mechanisms are known a priori or suspected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we propose to leverage the fact that most traits are genetically controlled to investigate the influence of the social environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we study associations between genotypes of one individual and phenotype of another individual (social genetic effects, SGE, also called indirect genetic effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, SGE can be studied even when the traits that mediate the influence of the social environment are not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the first time we quantified the contribution of SGE to more than 100 organismal phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression measured in laboratory mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that genetic variation in cage mates (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SGE) explains up to 29% of the variation in anxiety, wound healing, immune function, and body weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence our study uncovers an unexpectedly large influence of the social environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we show that ignoring SGE can severely bias estimates of direct genetic effects (effects of an individuals genotypes on its own phenotype), which has important implications for the study of the genetic basis of complex traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Social interactions contribute to health and disease (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  peer smoking increases ones risk of taking up smoking).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, quantifying social effects has required a clear hypothesis about the mechanisms mediating the influence of the social environment (in the example above peer smoking is the trait that mediates the social influence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For many phenotypes however, such hypotheses do not exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we propose an alternative strategy to study social effects: we investigate effects on an individual's phenotype that arise from genotypes of social partners (social genetic effects, SGE, also called indirect genetic effects[1, 2]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SGE constitute the genetic basis of social effects and can be detected without prior knowledge of the phenotypes through which the social influence is exerted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SGE have been reported for interactions between mothers and offspring (maternal genotypes indirectly affect offspring phenotypes)[38] and more recently for interactions between adult individuals, in livestock and wild animals[2, 917] For example, growth rate in farm pigs has been found to be in part determined by the genetic makeup of the other pigs in the pen[2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent to which SGE explain variation in biomedical traits is largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If SGE do contribute to such traits, they are a promising approach to quantify effects of the social environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, they provide an anchor to investigate causal paths and dissect the mechanisms underlying social effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in studies of direct genetic effects carried out by the broad community, SGE may be used to account for social environmental effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study aimed at quantifying the contribution of SGE to multiple biomedical traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We uncover unexpectedly large social genetic effects on multiple organismal and molecular phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether SGE explain variation in biomedical traits, we considered two experiments in laboratory mice involving complementary genetic designs, and assessed both organismal and gene expression traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experiment_with_two_inbred_strains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first carried out an experiment with two inbred strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2), the progenitor strains of the largest mouse reference population, the BxD recombinant inbred panel[18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We co-housed 86 mice at weaning as B6/B6, B6/D2 or D2/D2 pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a period of six weeks during which the mice interacted undisturbed in their home cages, we collected 50 organismal phenotypes relevant to unconditioned anxiety, helplessness (a measure of depressed mood), general locomotor activity, stress, social dominance, wound healing and body weight (Fig 1A, S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also profiled genome-wide gene expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PFC was selected because it is involved in coordinating behavioural responses based on sensorimotor information, motivation and affect, all of which may be affected by the social environment; as a result individual differences in PFC expression levels may reflect behavioural responses to the social environment [1921].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this design with two inbred strains there are three potential genetic sources of phenotypic variation: differences in the strain of the focal (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  phenotyped) mice (DGE), differences in the strain of their cage mates (SGE) and an interaction between the two, whereby the effect of the strain of the cage mate depends on the strain of the focal mouse (Fig 1B, S1 Fig and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variance partitioning and model selection (see Methods) provided evidence that interactions between DGE and SGE are common across traits (S2 Fig), with SGE typically affecting a specific trait in one strain (B6 or D2) but not the other (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1B, S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for each trait, we modeled the measurements collected in B6 mice and D2 focal mice separately (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For eleven out of 50 organismal phenotypes we found significant SGE in either B6 or D2 mice (P less_than 0.05, FDR less_than 43%see Methods; Table 1, S2 and S3 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strain-specific differences existed as different measures were affected by SGE in B6 and D2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these eleven phenotypes, two were measures of stress and six were measures of anxiety, providing evidence that variation in the genetic makeup of cage mates causes variation in stress-related phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direction of effect was consistent across the six measures of anxiety (S3 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also detected strong SGE on the rate of wound healing (measured from an ear punch, P = 6.6 103, Q = 0.36), showing that SGE are not limited to behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, SGE explained a considerable proportion of phenotypic variance (up to 18%), showing that social effects of genetic origin are important contributors to phenotypic variation in these two strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also found evidence that SGE affect gene expression in the PFC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A gene set enrichment analysis based on the contribution of SGE to gene expression levels (see Methods) revealed integrin-mediated signaling pathway(P = 2.5 106, Q = 0.024) and regulation of dopamine metabolic process (P = 7.0 104, Q = 1) as the most significant Gene Ontology (GO) terms in D2 and B6 mice respectively (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter enrichment, although statistically less robust, is strikingly consistent with our finding that SGE affect dopamine levels measured by HPLC in B6 mice (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results therefore converge to show that variation in the genetic makeup of cage mates causes variation in behavioral, biochemical, and gene expression traits relevant to stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the large number of tests limits the statistical power to detect SGE on individual genes (12,898 genes tested), we identified three genes with significant effects (Srsf2, Phlpp2, and Ppid; FDR less_than 33%; S4 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reanalysis_of_a_large_outbred_mice_dataset  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated SGE in a dataset from outbred (Heterogeneous Stock) mice[2224].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This design better represents traditional mouse housing conditions (groups of four, five and six mice mostly rather than pairs; S4 Fig) and genetic variation in natural populations (high genetic diversity and genetically unique individuals rather than two inbred strains).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dataset comprises more than 100 organismal phenotypes measured in 2,448 mice (S5 Table), and gene expression in hippocampus for a subset of 457 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accommodate the genetic design of this study, we fitted random effects models with variance components for DGE, SGE and their covariance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our models are inspired from models published in the literature[2, 25] yet differ in some important ways, which we explain and justify in S1 Note.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because genome-wide genotypes were not available for a subset of mice (526 out of 2,448), we used pedigree information to estimate pairwise genetic covariance for the mice with no genotype information (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the results obtained using both pedigree and genotype data for estimation of genetic similarity were in agreement with those obtained using genotype data only from the subset of mice that were in cages where all mice had been genotyped (S5 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All models were fitted using LIMIX[26, 27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulations showed that DGE and SGE were unbiased (S6 Fig and S7 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 117 organismal phenotypes available in this dataset, 43 were significantly affected by SGE (P less_than 0.05, FDR less_than 5.7%; Table 3, S5 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SGE explained up to 29% of phenotypic variation and an average of 8.9% across the 43 significantly affected traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the estimated contribution of SGE was greater than that of DGE for 8 of the 43 traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among the organismal phenotypes most significantly and strongly affected by SGE in this dataset were measures of lymphocyte activation (in particular size and number of CD4+ T cells and B cells, collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and full blood count, Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, measures related to other leucocytes (neutrophils, basophils and monocytes) and natural killer T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results indicate that genotypes of cage mates influence humoral immunity, although this is unlikely that this represents spread of a disease as the mice were kept in a clean mouse facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, rate of wound healing, the measure most significantly and strongly associated with SGE in the experiment with two inbred strains, was also significantly affected by SGE in the outbred dataset (P = 1.6 103, Q = 3.7 103).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three measures of body weight (collected on weeks 6 and 7) also figured among the traits significantly affected by SGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other measures of body weight, collected at weeks 9 and 10, showed no SGE (S5 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two sets of measures likely reflect a different phenotype as the normal physiology of the mice was disrupted between weeks 7 and 9 by aggressive phenotyping (tests of conditioned anxiety involving foot shocks, airway sensitization by allergen, intraperitoneal injection of glucose).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another potential but unlikely explanation for the higher contribution of SGE on earlier body weight measures is a sharp decrease in social effects between weeks 7 and 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, a subset of measures of anxiety, blood biochemistry, and lung function were also affected by the genotypes of cage mates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, there was no statistical evidence for SGE on gene expression levels in the hippocampus (smallest nominal P value 4.1 105 corresponding to a Q value of 64%, S6 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is most likely the result of a much smaller sample size (457 or 5% of mice) for expression traits, and is consistent with published power analyses[28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next explored whether studies focused on DGE can safely ignore SGE, focusing on the estimation of the collective effect of additive DGE on phenotypic variation (narrow-sense heritability).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the outbred dataset, cage mates are genetically more similar to each other than average (S8 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, DGE and SGE are correlated (an example of gene-environment correlation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesized that failing to account for SGE would bias estimates of DGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also hypothesized that fitting cage effects might be sufficient to eliminate this bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate both hypotheses, we compared DGE estimates obtained using a linear mixed model for DGE that does not account for cage effects nor SGE, a model that accounts for DGE and cage effects, and one that accounts for DGE, SGE, corresponding social environmental effects, and cage effects (full model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models that did not account for SGE led to substantially larger DGE estimates, and estimates from the model with DGE and cage effects were intermediate between those from the model with DGE only and those from the full model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In simulated traits based on the real genotypes and generated from DGE, SGE and cage effects (see Methods), we found that models that did not account for SGE yielded inflated DGE estimates, whereas joint modeling of DGE, SGE and cage effects resulted in unbiased estimates (Fig 2C and S6 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, fitting cage effects but no SGE did not eliminate the bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation results strongly suggest that, in the real data, the estimates obtained from the full model are most accurate, and that models that ignore SGE overestimate heritability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This problem is particularly acute when direct and social random genetic effects are positively correlated (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  , see Methods; Fig 2A and 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The problem we highlight here is general and likely to affect other studies in which social partners are related, including twin and family studies used to estimate heritability in humans (see Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using two complementary genetic designsone using two mouse inbred strains and one using outbred micewe estimated the contribution of social genetic effects to a variety of organismal phenotypes and gene expression traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment with two inbred strains was designed to investigate SGE and focused on behaviours (anxiety and helplessness), as there is strong evidence that behaviours are socially affected[2933].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether SGE can be detected in outbred populations and survey a broader range of phenotypes, we re-analysed a large dataset from outbred mice and quantified the contribution of SGE to more than 100 phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design of our study raises important questions: are positive results (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  evidence of SGE) in the experiment with two inbred strains expected to replicate in the outbred dataset?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Are some phenotypes expected to be affected by SGE and some not?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now discuss these points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some phenotypes were measured in both experiments with similar protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wound area, the measure of wound healing, was collected in both experiments using the exact same protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is significantly affected by SGE in both experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocols for measuring body and adrenal gland weight are fairly simple thus reducing technical variation between experiments, and body weight was measured at about the same time point (around 50 days of age) in both experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was strong evidence for SGE on body weight in the outbred dataset but no evidence in the experiment with two inbred strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No SGE on adrenal gland weight were detected in either dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a partially overlapping set of measures of unconditioned anxiety was significantly affected by SGE in both experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While reviewing results from the two experiments in parallel is informative, positive results in one experiment are not strictly expected to replicate in the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, although the variants that give rise to SGE in the experiment with two inbred strains also segregate in the outbred population (the two strains used in our experiment were among the eight founders of the outbred population), they have recombined with many additional variants from the six other founders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the housing conditions were very different in the experiment with inbred strains and outbred experiment (group size of 2 vs. 2 to 7 respectively, and unfamiliar mice vs. familiar mice housed together).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, one should not expect the overall contribution of SGE be the same in the two experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, combining the two experiments provides a first hint at the generalizability of our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Published studies of SGE provide additional information on this matter, and suggest that SGE may contribute to variation in body weight across species[2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
That social genetic effects contribute to variation in anxiety probably does not come as a surprise but their contribution to wound healing maybe more so.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is however supported by significant p-values in both experiments of our study and large effect sizes (18 and 6%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When interpreting this result, it is important to bear in mind that social effects on wound healing can (and will, necessarily) be mediated by traits of cage mates that are different from wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, social effects on wound healing could be mediated by social grooming, which could either mechanically disrupt the healing process or chemically enhance it[34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any traits of cage mates that may induce a systemic stress response in the focal animal could also mediate social effects on wound healing[35, 36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, social effects on wound healing are not unlikely, and, similarly, social effects may affect any phenotype (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  by through the induction of a systemic stress response,).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because any phenotype may a priori be affected by social effects and the mechanisms at play are rarely known, SGE offer an attractive alternative to investigate social effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, as we have shown, they can be used to quantify social effects, effectively providing a lower bound estimate of social effects (as only the genetic component is captured).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, SGE can be used to test whether a particular trait of social partners has an effect on a phenotype of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Establishing a causal relationship between two phenotypes is always difficult because of the risk of reverse causation and independent action of hidden confounders on both traits; SGE provide an anchor to test causality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Independent of their relevance for studying social effects, we show that ignoring SGE can lead to biased estimates of heritability (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the collective effect of DGE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study (outbred dataset), DGE and SGE are correlated by design (mice that share a cage are more genetically similar than average), and we show that this correlation leads to biased estimates of heritability if unaccounted for.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fitting cage effects, which has the primary goal of accounting for environmental effects shared by cage mates (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  noise levels), does not eliminate the bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are of interest to the broad genetics community as DGE and SGE are correlated in most if not all experimental designs traditionally used to estimate heritability in humans and model organisms, and SGE may thus have caused widespread bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in twin designs, MZ twins not only share 100% of their genotypes but they also share 100% of the genotypes of their sibling; DZ twins in comparison share both 50% of their genotypes and 50% of the genotypes of their sibling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, SGE can contribute to increased concordance between MZ twins compared to DZ twins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If SGE are not modelled, heritability may be overestimated and appear missing when compared to genome-wide association results obtained from unrelated individuals[37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that when the covariance  between direct and social random genetic effects is negative (competition effects), ignoring SGE may lead to underestimating heritability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SGE in humans were considered once before (sibling effects [38]) but were never, to the best of our knowledge, modelled in heritability studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we found that fitting cage effects was not sufficient to eliminate the bias due to SGE, we suspect that accounting for a common environment shared by family members, as is commonly done in human studies[3941], will not eliminate SGE-induced bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is not the first time that unaccounted for gene-environment correlations are put forward as potential causes of bias (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conley et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  investigated the correlation between genetics and urban setting [42]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the impact of the correlation between DGE and SGE is likely to be particularly severe as we have shown that SGE affect a wide range of phenotypes and DGE and SGE are correlated in most experimental designs used to estimate heritability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study sheds light on an important component of the genetic architecture of complex traits, one that lies outside the individual, in social partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Social genetic effects have already been shown to play an important role in artificial selection of livestock[43] and have important evolutionary consequences[44, 45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide evidence that SGE are also an important component of health and disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
