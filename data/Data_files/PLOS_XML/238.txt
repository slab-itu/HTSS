The Oldest Jurassic Dinosaur: A Basal Neotheropod from the Hettangian of Great Britain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately 40% of a skeleton including cranial and postcranial remains representing a new genus and species of basal neotheropod dinosaur is described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was collected from fallen blocks from a sea cliff that exposes Late Triassic and Early Jurassic marine and quasi marine strata on the south Wales coast near the city of Cardiff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matrix comparisons indicate that the specimen is from the lithological Jurassic part of the sequence, below the first occurrence of the index ammonite Psiloceras planorbis and above the last occurrence of the Rhaetian conodont Chirodella verecunda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Associated fauna of echinoderms and bivalves indicate that the specimen had drifted out to sea, presumably from the nearby Welsh Massif and associated islands (St Davids Archipelago).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its occurrence close to the base of the Blue Lias Formation (Lower Jurassic, Hettangian) makes it the oldest known Jurassic dinosaur and it represents the first dinosaur skeleton from the Jurassic of Wales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cladistic analysis indicates basal neotheropodan affinities, but the specimen retains plesiomorphic characters which it shares with Tawa and Daemonosaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Theropod dinosaurs are extremely rare in the Lower Jurassic and most reports are of only fragmentary remains[16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rarity results in a considerable gap in our knowledge of these animals at a time when, indications are, theropods were diversifying rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Europe Early Jurassic theropods are reported from the Hettangian of Scotland[1], England[2,3,4], France[5] and Belgium[6], but all of these occurrences are of fragmentary material, isolated bones, or a few associated elements, with most of it non-diagnostic at generic level (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oddly, most have been obtained from marine or marginal marine strata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few examples of Lower Jurassic theropods are known from elsewhere; they include the abelisaurid Berberosaurus from the Toarcian of Morocco[7], Cryolophosaurus from the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian of Antarctica[8], Syntarsus from the Hettangian-Pliensbachian of South Africa and Zimbabwe [9,10], Podekosaurus from the Pliensbachian to Toarcian of Massachussetts[11], and from Arizona Dilophosaurus from the Hettangian[12] and Segisaurus from the Pliensbachian to Toarcian[13], all of which are Neotheropoda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the derived therizinosaurid Eshanosaurus in the Lower Jurassic of China, tentatively dated as Hettangian[14], implies that many other higher theropod taxa should also be represented in the Lower Jurassic, if the dating of Eshanosaurus proves correct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a Hettangian age for Eshanosaurus contrasts with all other therizinosaurid occurrences[15], although the paucity of theropod remains in the Lower Jurassic globally may be the explanation for the disparity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is imperative that fragmentary remains such as those of Eshanosaurus are identified correctly and reliably dated before any firm conclusions are drawn from their seemingly anachronistic occurrences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two theropods have been named from the English Hettangian, Sarcosaurus woodi Andrews, 1921[4] from Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire, based on an isolated pelvis, vertebra and proximal femur (BMNH 4840/1) and Sarcosaurus andrewsi Huene, 1932 [16] based on a partial tibia (NHMUK R3542) (see also ref [3]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Dinosaurs_in_Wales  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite extensive outcrops of early Mesozoic strata in south Wales, including units of vertebrate-bearing, non-marine and marginal marine facies, the remains of dinosaurs in Wales are exceedingly rare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excluding the Triassic (Norian) age footprints of Barry, Glamorgan[17], most Welsh dinosaur records are of isolated bones and teeth from fissure fill deposits where poorly dated sequences infill palaeokarst developed in Carboniferous age limestones[18,19] or from rémanie deposits, such as the so-called Rhaetian bone bed at or near the base of the Westbury Formation[20,21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single, large theropod left dentary with teeth was recovered from loose blocks of probable littoral sandstones from Stormy Down, Glamorgan,[22] and named Zanclodon cambrensis (see [21]) while Thecodontosaurus caducus was from the Late Triassic of Bonvilston, Glamorgan, south Wales[18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This specimen was later given its own genus, Pantydraco[23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we describe a partial disarticulated skeleton, including the skull, of a new genus and species of theropod dinosaur from well-dated marine strata of the southeast coast of Wales (Figs 2,3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It represents the most complete theropod from Wales, and one of the most complete from the European Lower Jurassic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specimen is deposited in Amgueddfa CymruNational Museum Wales, Cardiff, accession number NMW 2015.5G.12015.5G.11 with individual blocks and skeletal elements numbered as in Table 1 (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Basic_collecting__preparation_and_repair  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The specimen was discovered in March 2014 and rescue collected from a minor cliff collapse of well bedded limestones and mudstones at Lavernock Point (Fig 4) by Mr Nick Hanigan and Mr Rob Hanigan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger blocks were dried over two weeks under damp newspaper to prevent rapid shrinkage and cracking of a thin mudstone veneer on the limestone surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The various slabs were cleaned and prepared mechanically to expose bones using sodium bicarbonate abrasive powder, and were X-rayed and CT scanned at the Faculty of Clinical Radiology, University of Manchester.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small broken bones were repaired using superglue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slabs with bones represented as external moulds were cast in a silicon compound, replicated in fibreglass and resin, and painted to restore missing bones known to have been present and presumed lost to the sea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive searching failed to discover the missing bones on the foreshore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There exists the possibility that some of the specimen remains in the cliff, but repeated careful examination of the cliff face failed to reveal any exposed bones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cladistic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish the phylogenetic position of the new specimen it was analysed in a cladistic analysis comprised of 366 characters and 46 taxa, 18 of which lie outside of Dinosauria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis used the 338 characters and coding of You et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [24], formerly of Ezcurra and Brusatte[25], with Daemonosaurus included using the coding of Sues et al.[26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was possible to atomize 25 of the compound characters (sensu [27]) in the character list of Ezcurra and Brusatte[25], resulting in a further 28 characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional compound character was reduced from three character states to two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate the effect of atomizing compound characters an experiment using jacknife procedures was conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The jacknife analysis was manually performed using Microsoft Excel to generate random characters for omission in each replicate of the procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each replicate of the jacknife procedure the number of characters utilised and the resulting tree-lengths were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The jacknife procedure was implemented on the original matrix of You et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [24] and the matrix presented here, minus Daemonosaurus and the new theropod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two bivariate plots were generated from the recorded data; one analysing difference in tree-length (total matrix tree-length minus jacknife replicate tree-length) vs. the number of characters removed; and the other analysing tree-length vs. the number of characters analysed in each replicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was predicted that the former plot would demonstrate the same rate of tree-length decay as characters are removed, whilst the latter would demonstrate an overall difference in tree-length between the two matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the event of the predictions being correct, the two graphs in tandem would demonstrate a difference between the matrices that is a result of a change in character conflict, as opposed to the quantity of characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ensemble retention index (RI) which is independent of character number did not change between the original analysis of You et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [24] and the new analysis, due to the coding being exactly the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, a plot of the difference in tree-length vs. the number of characters removed demonstrated the same rate of tree-length decay for both matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the larger, new matrix was only 15 steps longer despite an additional 25 characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the difference in relative tree-lengths taken from the regression lines of the jacknife plot (tree-length vs. number of characters) was approximately 60 steps less for the larger matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the jacknife demonstrates the benefits of atomizing compound characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The final analysis was run in TNT using a new technology search.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Implied weights were used to adjust character weights during the analysis, in order to combat any coding errors or character conflict that was not resolved by atomizing compound characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting MPT stored to the computers RAM was further analysed with a TBR swapping algorithm in TNTs traditional search function to resolve the maximum MPTs possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Bootstrap analysis using 100 replicates in a new technology search was also run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absolute values were stored on the bootstrap tree and it can be found, along with further details on all the procedures discussed here in the supporting information (S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Stratigraphic_Position_and_Age  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although not found in situ, the new dinosaur has been constrained on lithological grounds to one of two limestone horizons within the Blue Lias Formation of the Lower Lias Group (Fig 4), and specifically within the lower Bull Cliff Member (stratigraphic terminology follows that of Simms[28]) in the Bristol Channel Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, this horizon is the one part of the sequence for which a precise date remains contentious as it lies below the first occurrence of the ammonite Psiloceras planorbis (Sowerby, 1824)[29] historically used by British stratigraphers to define the base of the Jurassic[30], and above the last occurrence of a marker conodont for the Triassic, namely Chirodella verecunda Swift, 1995[31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a matter of pragmatism, these strata have traditionally been regarded as Late Rhaetian age and are informally called the Pre-Planorbis Beds [28,32,33,34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new dinosaur comes from a stratum that is ~3 metres below the first occurrence of P. planorbis and ~4 metres above the last confirmed conodont occurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At Lavernock Point there is a distinctive lithological change at the base of the Blue Lias Formation that historically was used by some workers as a lithological definition of the base of the Jurassic[35] and is employed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In European and North American sections across the Rhaetian/Hettangian (Triassic/Jurassic) boundary the first appearance of a psiloceratacean ammonite is marked by the occurrence of Psilocerus erugatum, followed by P. imitans and P. antecedans, all of which are used to define subzones beneath the first occurrence of P. planorbis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Austria P. spelae tirolicum, P. cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pacificum and P. ex gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. tilmanni occur in strata below P. planorbis[36] while in Belgium and northeast Russia, Primapsiloceras primulum has been reported from strata below P. planorbis[37,38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These earliest Jurassic subzones and other psilocerataceans have not been detected in the Lavernock Point sequence of strata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ammonites predating Psiloceras planorbis have been found in the basal Blue Lias Formation of Somerset, just 22 km south of Lavernock Point[34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include examples of P. cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  erugatum and Neophyllites sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  demonstrating that the basal subzone ammonites of the Jurassic did reach the British Isles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The absence of these very early Jurassic forms at Lavernock is either a reflection of a facies dependency of the earliest Jurassic ammonites that excludes them from nearer shore waters, or (more likely) lack of preservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this latter respect it is worth noting that P. planorbis fossils of higher beds in the Lavernock Point Blue Lias Formation are preserved as compressed periostracal films with no aragonite preservation nor calcitic shell replacement, while aragonitic bivalves are entirely missing from the Bull Cliff Member.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fossil assemblage is thus a chemical lag dominated by calcitic fossils (echinoderms, ostreacean and pectenacean bivalves), and phosphatic vertebrate remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The question remains, should the new dinosaur be attributed to the very latest Triassic, or the very earliest Jurassic?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geochemical considerations may help resolve the precise stratigraphic age of the dinosaur bearing stratum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of studies have located isotopic excursions at or near the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [39] for sequences in Hungary; [40] for Austria; [41] for Nevada, USA) and the British Isles[42,43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A study at Lavernock Point[42], found a 13Corg negative anomaly at the top of the Langport Member of the Triassic Penarth Group, while an extensive, integrated analysis of a section on the south side of the Severn Estuary at St Audries Bay, Somerset also detected a massive 13Corg negative isotope excursion commencing just above the last conodont occurrences, but before the first ammonite occurrence[43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This negative excursion has also been detected elsewhere, and in a section in New York State, USA, Ward et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [44] proposed this excursion to define the base of the Jurassic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conodont_ages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conodonts have been recorded from the Late Triassic Langport Member of the Lilstock Formation (Penarth Group) at Lavernock Point, some 4 metres beneath the dinosaur discovery site and 7 metres below the first occurrence of Psiloceras planorbis[44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of Chirodella verecunda Swift, 1995[31] have been collected from Bed 3 of Ivimey Cook[45] (see also [46,31]) and are indicative of the Misikella postehernsteini (Kozur and Mock, 1974)[47] conodont biozone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conodont biozone is indicative of the Rhaetian Paracochloceras suessi to Cochloceras marshi ammonite biozones of the Tethyan Late Triassic[48,49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The zonal conodont indicator Misikella postehernsteini has not been reported with certainty from Lavernock Point, but it has been reported from lithologically equivalent strata in the English Midlands[31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Latest_Triassic_or_earliest_Jurassic?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Golden Spike [GSSP] for the base of the Jurassic is at Kuhjoch in the Austrian Northern Calcareous Alps[36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this locality the base of the Jurassic is defined at the first occurrence of the psiloceratacean ammonite Psiloceras spelae tirolicum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ammonite species occurs approximately 5 metres above the isotopic excursion proposed as the base of the Jurassic[50,51].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hillebrandt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [36] in commenting on the T/J boundary in Britain stated that the boundary should be expected to occur in the lowest few meters of the Blue Lias Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is fair to say that in the British Isles, it may never be possible to define the T/J boundary, and that a pragmatic approach may be adopted as a matter of convenience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minor-non-sequence beneath the basal Paper Shale horizon at the base of the Blue Lias Formation would seem the most logical place to put the Triassic/Jurassic Boundary at Lavernock Point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering that the new dinosaur occurs at a stratigraphic position above the 13Corg isotope anomaly; that it occurs above a clear lithological boundary representing a distinct facies change from shallow to deepening marine conditions; that it is associated with a Jurassic type shelly fauna, and that pollen analyses of nearby sections are of Jurassic type[50,52], the new dinosaur should be regarded as being of Early Hettangian age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus it most likely belongs to the P. erugatum subzone of the P. tilmanni Zone and is dated at 201.3 ± 0.2 million years old[36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Skull  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The skull is around 2/3 complete, but disarticulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the few associated teeth have fallen from their alveoli, but are closely associated with tooth-bearing elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anterior rostral bones, premaxillae and maxillae are associated, but not articulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some elements of the skull are preserved as external moulds, or have composite bone/mouldic preservation, notably jugal and lacrimal elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the braincase only a supraoccipital has been confidently identified and only more caudal elements of the lower jaws have been identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Axial_skeleton  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Elements of the axial skeleton preserved include cervical vertebrae and ribs, posterior thoracic vertebrae, anterior thoracic ribs, anterior caudal vertebrae, chevrons and gastralia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most are disarticulated, and most vertebral centra are separated from their neural arches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some ribs are associated with vertebrae, but none are articulated with them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least five centra are in loose articulation close to the pelvic elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Forelimb  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A partial left forelimb is preserved comprising a distal humerus, complete radius and ulna, metacarpals, phalanges and unguals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are loosely associated with the radius and ulna in approximate articulation and only slightly displaced from the humerus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are no carpals, presumably a consequence of the immature age of the individual and consequent delayed ossification of the carpal elements[61], but it cannot be ruled out that they have simply been lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the degree of disarticulation of the manual elements the phalangeal formula has not been determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pelvic_girdle_and_hind_limb  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Elements of the pelvis and hind limb are preserved, but none are complete or in articulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ilia are missing and only the left and right pubes and?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  left ischium are preserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The right femur, partial fibula and portion of probable tibial diaphysis are present, while one disconnected slab has three proximal portions of the metatarsals, partially preserved as external moulds (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analysis of 366 characters for 46 taxa resolved Neotheropoda, with Tawa hallae as its sister taxon, similar to the analysis of Nesbitt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [61], Ezcurra and Brusatte [25] and You et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [24] (Fig 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the topology of the basal region of Neotheropoda differs, being more similar to the results of the Sues et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [26] analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coelophysoids Liliensternus liliensterni and Zupaysaurus rougieri are now successive sister taxa to crown group neotheropods, making the contents of Coelophysoidea sensu Nesbitt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [61] synonymous with Neotheropoda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dracoraptor hanigani is recovered as the basal most coelophysoid, sister taxon to Syntarsus kayentakatae and all other coelophysids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coelophysidae is supported by 3 synapomorphies (15 in the bootstrap) and Neotheropoda is supported by 23 synapomorphies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bootstrap results demonstrate that although Neotheropoda is well supported, the basal part of the group is not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dracoraptor hanigani, Liliensternus liliensterni, Zupaysaurus rougieri, Dilophosaurus wetherelli, Ceratosaurus nasicornis and Cryolophosaurus ellioti are found in a polytomy with the remaining clades of Neotheropoda; Coelophysidae and an unnamed clade containing Velociraptor, Allosaurus and Piatnitzkysaurus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dracoraptor hanigani possesses 18 apomorphies, some of which are convergent with more derived neotheropods, but it also retains plesiomorphic conditions, such as three teeth in the premaxilla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dracoraptor hanigani is clearly a saurischian dinosaur on account of its pelvic construction, while the possession of serrated, recurved laterally compressed teeth among other characters demonstrates its theropod affinities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cladistic analysis finds Dracoraptor to lie within Neotheropoda, but is basal within the clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dracoraptor can be distinguished from other basal neotheropods from the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic on a variety of criteria, not necessarily apomorphic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Dracoraptor possesses a combination of basal characters that make it difficult to place phylogenetically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shallow antorbital fossa of the maxilla, an anteriorly located pleurocoel on the cervical vertebrae and the presence of an obturator notch in the ischium indicates neotheropodan affinities ([63], characters 12, 88, 190 respectively), but many of the other neotheropodan synapomorphies cannot be identified in Dracoraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cladistic analysis recovers Dracoraptor as the sister taxon to Syntarsus kayentakatae and all other coelophysids placing it close to the base of Coelophysoidea (Fig 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, several of the synapomorphies of Coelophysoidea are coded ?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for Dracoraptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably the horizontal ridge of the maxilla parallel to the tooth row (character 15 of[63]) cannot be seen as both left and right maxillae expose their internal surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sublacrimal process of the jugal of Dracoraptor is certainly not pointed as it is in some non-coelophysoid theropods, but this process is slender, slightly damaged and it is ambiguous as to whether it is bluntly rounded (Character 23, state 1 Rauhut 2003)[63] which is typical for coelophysoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dracoraptor retains many basal features, and would appear to be very basal within Neotheropoda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that further preparation of the specimen will enable the identification of additional characters that may better resolve its phylogenetic affinities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of Dracoraptor in marine strata may be of little significance with regard to the animals autecology, but we have restored it as a shore-line dwelling animal (Fig 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
