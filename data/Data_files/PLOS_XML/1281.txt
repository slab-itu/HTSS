Genome-wide physical activity interactions in adiposity  A meta-analysis of 200,452 adults  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Physical activity (PA) may modify the genetic effects that give rise to increased risk of obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify adiposity loci whose effects are modified by PA, we performed genome-wide interaction meta-analyses of BMI and BMI-adjusted waist circumference and waist-hip ratio from up to 200,452 adults of European (n = 180,423) or other ancestry (n = 20,029).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We standardized PA by categorizing it into a dichotomous variable where, on average, 23% of participants were categorized as inactive and 77% as physically active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we replicate the interaction with PA for the strongest known obesity-risk locus in the FTO gene, of which the effect is attenuated by ~30% in physically active individuals compared to inactive individuals, we do not identify additional loci that are sensitive to PA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In additional genome-wide meta-analyses adjusting for PA and interaction with PA, we identify 11 novel adiposity loci, suggesting that accounting for PA or other environmental factors that contribute to variation in adiposity may facilitate gene discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Decline in daily physical activity is thought to be a key contributor to the global obesity epidemic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the impact of sedentariness on adiposity may be in part determined by a persons genetic constitution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific genetic variants that are sensitive to physical activity and regulate adiposity remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we aimed to identify genetic variants whose effects on adiposity are modified by physical activity by examining ~2.5 million genetic variants in up to 200,452 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested whether adjusting for physical activity as a covariate could lead to the identification of novel adiposity variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find robust evidence of interaction with physical activity for the strongest known obesity risk-locus in the FTO gene, of which the body mass index-increasing effect is attenuated by ~30% in physically active individuals compared to inactive individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses indicate that other similar gene-physical activity interactions may exist, but better measurement of physical activity, larger sample sizes, and/or improved analytical methods will be required to identify them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adjusting for physical activity, we identify 11 novel adiposity variants, suggesting that accounting for physical activity or other environmental factors that contribute to variation in adiposity may facilitate gene discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In recent decades, we have witnessed a global obesity epidemic that may be driven by changes in lifestyle such as easier access to energy-dense foods and decreased physical activity (PA) [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, not everyone becomes obese in obesogenic environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twin studies suggest that changes in body weight in response to lifestyle interventions are in part determined by a persons genetic constitution [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the genes that are sensitive to environmental influences remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies suggest that genetic susceptibility to obesity, assessed by a genetic risk score for BMI, may be attenuated by PA [5, 6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large-scale meta-analysis of the FTO obesity locus in 218,166 adults showed that being physically active attenuates the BMI-increasing effect of this locus by ~30% [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these findings suggest that FTO, and potentially other previously established BMI loci, may interact with PA, it has been hypothesized that loci showing the strongest main effect associations in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may be the least sensitive to environmental and lifestyle influences, and may therefore not make the best candidates for interactions [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet no genome-wide search for novel loci exhibiting SNP×PA interaction has been performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A genome-wide meta-analysis of genotype-dependent phenotypic variance of BMI, a marker of sensitivity to environmental exposures, in ~170,000 participants identified FTO, but did not show robust evidence of environmental sensitivity for other loci [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent genome-wide meta-analyses of adiposity traits in  greater than 320,000 individuals uncovered loci interacting with age and sex, but also suggested that very large sample sizes are required for interaction studies to be successful [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we report results from a large-scale genome-wide meta-analysis of SNP×PA interactions in adiposity in up to 200,452 adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As part of these interaction analyses, we also examine whether adjusting for PA or jointly testing for SNPs main effect and interaction with PA may identify novel adiposity loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Identification_of_loci_interacting_with_PA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed meta-analyses of results from 60 studies, including up to 180,423 adults of European descent and 20,029 adults of other ancestries to assess interactions between ~2.5 million genotyped or HapMap-imputed SNPs and PA on BMI and BMI-adjusted waist circumference (WCadjBMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHRadjBMI) (S1S5 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to a previous meta-analysis of the interaction between FTO and PA [7], we standardized PA by categorizing it into a dichotomous variable where on average ~23% of participants were categorized as inactive and ~77% as physically active (see Methods and S6 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, inactive individuals had 0.99 kg/m2 higher BMI, 3.46 cm higher WC, and 0.018 higher WHR than active individuals (S4 and S5 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each study first performed genome-wide association analyses for each SNPs effect on BMI in the inactive and active groups separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corresponding summary statistics from each cohort were subsequently meta-analyzed, and the SNP×PA interaction effect was estimated by calculating the difference in the SNPs effect between the inactive and active groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify sex-specific SNP×PA interactions, we performed the meta-analyses separately in men and women, as well as in the combined sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we carried out meta-analyses in European-ancestry studies only and in European and other-ancestry studies combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used two approaches to identify loci whose effects are modified by PA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first approach, we searched for genome-wide significant SNP×PA interaction effects (PINTless_than5x10-8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1, this approach yielded the highest power to identify cross-over interaction effects where the SNPs effect is directionally opposite between the inactive and active groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this approach has low power to identify interaction effects where the SNPs effect is directionally concordant between the inactive and active groups (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a genome-wide significant interaction between rs986732 in cadherin 12 (CDH12) and PA on BMI in European-ancestry studies (betaINT = -0.076 SD/allele, PINT = 3.1x10-8, n = 134,767) (S7 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction effect was directionally consistent but did not replicate in an independent sample of 31,097 individuals (betaINT = -0.019 SD/allele, PINT = 0.52), and the pooled association P value for the discovery and replication stages combined did not reach genome-wide significance (NTOTAL = 165,864; PINT-TOTAL = 3x10-7) (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No loci showed genome-wide significant interactions with PA on WCadjBMI or WHRadjBMI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CDH12 encodes an integral membrane protein mediating calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion in the brain, where it may play a role in neurogenesis [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CDH12 rs4701252 and rs268972 SNPs have shown suggestive associations with waist circumference (P = 2x10-6) and BMI (P = 5x10-5) in previous GWAS [12, 13], the SNPs are not in LD with rs986732 (r2less_than0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our second approach, we tested interaction for loci showing a genome-wide significant main effect on BMI, WCadjBMI or WHRadjBMI (S7S12 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We adjusted the significance threshold for SNP×PA interaction by Bonferroni correction (P = 0.05/number of SNPs tested).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1, this approach enhanced our power to identify interaction effects where there is a difference in the magnitude of the SNPs effect between inactive and active groups when the SNPs effect is directionally concordant between the groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a significant SNP×PA interaction of the FTO rs9941349 SNP on BMI in the meta-analysis of European-ancestry individuals; the BMI-increasing effect was 33% smaller in active individuals (betaACTIVE = 0.072 SD/allele) than in inactive individuals (betaINACTIVE = 0.106 SD/allele, PINT = 4x10-5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rs9941349 SNP is in strong LD (r2 = 0.87) with FTO rs9939609 for which interaction with PA has been previously established in a meta-analysis of 218,166 adults [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified no loci interacting with PA for WCadjBMI or WHRadjBMI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a previously published meta-analysis [7], the FTO locus showed a geographic difference for the interaction effect where the interaction was more pronounced in studies from North America than in those from Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for geographic differences in the present study, we performed additional meta-analyses for the FTO rs9941349 SNP, stratified by geographic origin (North America vs. Europe).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the interaction effect was more pronounced in studies from North America (betaINT = 0.052 SD/allele, P = 5x10-4, N = 63,896) than in those from Europe (betaINT = 0.028 SD/allele, P = 0.006, N = 109,806), we did not find a statistically significant difference between the regions (P = 0.14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_novel_loci_when_adjusting_for_PA_or_when_jointly_testing_for_SNP_main_effect_and_interaction_with_PA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Physical activity contributes to variation in BMI, WCadjBMI, and WHRadjBMI, hence, adjusting for PA as a covariate may enhance power to identify novel adiposity loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To that extent, each study performed genome-wide analyses for association with BMI, WCadjBMI, and WHRadjBMI while adjusting for PA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we performed meta-analyses of the study-specific results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered 10 genome-wide significant loci (2 for BMI, 1 for WCadjBMI, 7 for WHRadjBMI) that have not been reported in previous GWAS of adiposity traits (Table 1, S2S4 Figs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish whether additionally accounting for SNP×PA interactions would identify novel loci, we calculated the joint significance of PA-adjusted SNP main effect and SNP×PA interaction using the method of Aschard et al [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 1, the joint test enhanced our power to identify loci where the SNP shows simultaneously a main effect and an interaction effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a novel BMI locus near ELAVL2 in men (PJOINT = 4x10-8), which also showed suggestive evidence of interaction with PA (PINT = 9x10-4); the effect of the BMI-increasing allele was attenuated by 71% in active as compared to inactive individuals (betaINACTIVE = 0.087 SD/allele, betaACTIVE = 0.025 SD/allele) (Table 1, S2S4 Figs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the effect of PA adjustment on the results for the 11 novel loci, we performed a look-up in published GIANT consortium meta-analyses for BMI, WCadjBMI, and WHRadjBMI that did not adjust for PA [17, 18] (S22 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All 11 loci showed a consistent direction of effect between the present PA-adjusted and the previously published PA-unadjusted results, but the PA-unadjusted associations were less pronounced despite up to 40% greater sample size, suggesting that adjustment for PA may have increased our power to identify these loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The biological relevance of putative candidate genes in the novel loci, based on our thorough searches of the literature, GWAS catalog look-ups, and analyses of eQTL enrichment and overlap with functional regulatory elements, are described in Tables 2 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the novel loci were identified in a PA-adjusted model, where adjusting for PA may have contributed to their identification, we examined whether the lead SNPs in these loci are associated with the level of PA. More specifically, we performed look-ups in GWAS analyses for the levels of moderate-to-vigorous intensity leisure-time PA (n = 80,035), TV-viewing time (n = 28,752), and sedentary behavior at work (n = 59,381) or during transportation (n = 15,152) [personal communication with Marcel den Hoed, Marilyn Cornelis, and Ruth Loos].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not find significant associations when correcting for the number of loci that were examined (P greater than 0.005) (S16 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_secondary_signals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to uncovering 11 novel adiposity loci, our PA-adjusted GWAS and the joint test of SNP main effect and SNP×PA interaction confirmed 148 genome-wide significant loci (50 for BMI, 58 for WCadjBMI, 40 for WHRadjBMI) that have been established in previous main effect GWAS for adiposity traits (S7S12 Tables, S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lead SNPs in eight of the previously established loci (5 for BMI, 3 for WCadjBMI), however, showed no LD or only weak LD (r2less_than0.3) with the published lead SNP, suggesting they could represent novel secondary signals in known loci (S17 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether these eight signals are independent of the previously published signals, we performed conditional analyses [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of the eight SNPs we examined, in/near NDUFS4, MEF2C-AS1 and CPA1, were associated with WCadjBMI with Pless_than5x10-8 in our PA-adjusted GWAS even after conditioning on the published lead SNP, hence representing novel secondary signals in these loci (S17 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Enrichment_of_the_identified_loci_with_functional_regulatory_elements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Epigenetic variation may underlie gene-environment interactions observed in epidemiological studies [20] and PA has been shown to induce marked epigenetic changes in the genome [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined whether the BMI or WHRadjBMI loci reaching Pless_than1x10-5 for interaction with PA (13 loci for BMI, 5 for WHRadjBMI) show overall enrichment with chromatin states in adipose, brain and muscle tissues available from the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not find significant enrichment (S18 and S19 Tables), which may be due to the limited number of identified loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of significant findings may also be due to the assessment of chromatin states in the basal state, which may not reflect the dynamic changes that occur when cells are perturbed by PA [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also tested whether the loci reaching Pless_than5x10-8 in our PA-adjusted GWAS of BMI or WHRadjBMI show enrichment with chromatin states and found significant enrichment of the BMI loci with enhancer, weak transcription, and polycomb-repressive elements in several brain cell lines, and with enhancer elements in three muscle cell lines (S20 and S21 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found significant enrichment of the WHRadjBMI loci with enhancer elements in three adipose and six muscle cell lines, with active transcription start sites in two adipose cell lines, and with polycomb-repressive elements in seven brain cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enrichment of our PA-adjusted main effect results with chromatin annotations in skeletal muscle in particular, the tissue most affected by PA, could highlight regulatory mechanisms that may be influenced by PA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this genome-wide meta-analysis of more than 200,000 adults, we do not find evidence of interaction with PA for loci other than the established FTO locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when adjusting for PA or jointly testing for SNP main effect and interaction with PA, we identify 11 novel adiposity loci, suggesting that accounting for PA or other environmental factors that contribute to variation in adiposity may increase power for gene discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results suggest that if SNP×PA interaction effects for common variants exist, they are unlikely to be of greater magnitude than observed for FTO, the BMI-increasing effect of which is attenuated by ~30% in physically active individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that common SNPs explain less of the BMI variance among physically active compared to inactive individuals indicates that further interactions may exist, but larger meta-analyses, more accurate and precise measurement of PA, and/or improved analytical methods will be required to identify them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no difference between inactive and active individuals in variance explained by common SNPs in aggregate for WCadjBMI or WHRadjBMI, and no loci interacted with PA on WCadjBMI or WHRadjBMI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, PA may not modify genetic influences as strongly for body fat distribution as for overall adiposity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, while differences in variance explained by common variants may be due to genetic effects being modified by PA, it is important to note that heritability can change in the absence of changes in genetic effects, if environmental variation differs between the inactive and active groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the lower BMI variance explained in the active group could be partly due to a potentially greater environmental variation in this group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While we replicated the previously observed interaction between FTO and PA [7], it remains unclear what biological mechanisms underlie the attenuation in FTOs effect in physically active individuals, and whether the interaction is due to PA or due to confounding by other environmental exposures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some studies suggest that FTO may interact with diet [2426], a recent meta-analysis of 177,330 individuals did not find interaction between FTO and dietary intakes of total energy, protein, carbohydrate or fat [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obesity-associated FTO variants are located in a super-enhancer region [28] and have been associated with DNA methylation levels [2931], suggesting that this region may be sensitive to epigenetic effects that could mediate the interaction between FTO and PA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In genome-wide analyses for SNP main effects adjusting for PA, or when testing for the joint significance of SNP main effect and SNPxPA interaction, we identify 11 novel adiposity loci, even though our sample size was up to 40% smaller than in the largest published main effect meta-analyses [17, 18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that accounting for PA may facilitate the discovery of novel adiposity loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, accounting for other environmental factors that contribute to variation in adiposity could lead to the discovery of additional loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present meta-analyses, statistical power to identify SNPxPA interactions may have been limited due to challenges relating to the measurement and statistical modeling of PA [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 60 participating studies, 56 assessed PA by self-report while 4 used wearable PA monitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurement error and bias inherent in self-report estimates of PA [32] can attenuate effect sizes for SNP×PA interaction effects towards the null [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurement using PA monitors provides more consistent results, but the monitors are not able to cover all types of activities and the measurement covers a limited time span compared to questionnaires [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As sample size requirements increase nonlinearly when effect sizes decrease, any factor that leads to a deflation in the observed interaction effect estimates may make their detection very difficult, even when very large population samples are available for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, because of the wide differences in PA assessment tools used among the participating studies, we treated PA as a dichotomous variable, harmonizing PA into inactive and active individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considerable loss of power is anticipated when a continuous PA variable is dichotomized [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our power could be enhanced by using a continuous PA variable if a few larger studies with equivalent, quantitative PA measurements were available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, while our results suggest that adjusting for PA or other environmental factors that contribute to variation in adiposity may increase power for gene discovery, we do not find evidence of SNP×PA interaction effects stronger than that observed for FTO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While other SNP×PA interaction effects on adiposity are likely to exist, combining many small studies with varying characteristics and PA assessment tools may be inefficient for identifying such effects [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Access to large cohorts with quantitative, equivalent PA variables, measured with relatively high accuracy and precision, may be necessary to uncover novel SNP×PA interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
