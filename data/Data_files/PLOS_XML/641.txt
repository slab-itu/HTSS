We Made Your Bed, Why Wont You Lie in It?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Food Availability and Disease May Affect Reproductive Output of Reintroduced Frogs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mitigation to offset the impacts of land development is becoming increasingly common, with reintroductions and created habitat programs used as key actions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, numerous reviews cite high rates of poor success from these programs, and a need for improved monitoring and scientific testing to evaluate outcomes and improve management actions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted extensive monitoring of a released population of endangered green and golden bell frogs, Litoria aurea, within a created habitat, as well as complementary surveys of a surrounding wild population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then compared differences between the created habitat and natural ponds where extant frogs either bred or didnt breed in order to determine factors that contributed to the breeding failure within the created habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated differences of L. aurea abundance, abundance of other fauna, vegetation, water quality, habitat structure, invasive fish, and disease between the three pond types (created habitat, breeding ponds, non-breeding ponds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered that vegetation and invertebrate diversity were low within the created habitat, potentially reducing energy and nutritional resources required for breeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, a greater proportion of frogs in the created habitat were carrying the chytrid fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, compared to the wild populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to causing the potentially fatal disease, chytridiomycosis, this pathogen has been shown to reduce reproductive functioning in male L. aurea, and subsequently may have reduced reproductive activities in the created habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conspecific attraction, pond hydrology, and aquatic vegetation may also have had some influence on breeding behaviours, whilst the presence of the invasive mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, and heterospecific tadpoles were unlikely to have deterred L. aurea from breeding within the created habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through the use of scientific testing and monitoring, this study is able to make recommendations for future amphibian breed and release programs, and suggests planting a diversity of plant species to attract invertebrates, creating some permanent ponds, connecting habitat with existing populations, trialling artificial mating calls, and following recommendations to reduce the prevalence of disease within the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anthropogenic habitat loss and degradation is the leading cause of global species decline [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response, many countries have established legislative strategies centred on habitat offsetting and/or land mitigation to curb environmental damage and species loss [2, 3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Offsetting commonly involves the restoration of degraded habitat or creation of a certain habitat type, to improve suitability for either a particular species or ecosystem biodiversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, it is worth noting that in some cases, threatened species will occasionally inhabit disturbed habitats [4, 5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When land is created for a particular species, translocations or captive breed and release programs are commonly associated [6, 7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whilst these considerable conservation efforts are largely a positive step forward, there are many factors, including our limited understanding of the complex interactions within natural systems, that make these undertakings difficult, and success rare [8, 9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whilst the intuitive goal of species-level translocations or created habitat programs is to create a self-sustaining viable population of the target species, the release of captive bred animals alone, is not enough to ensure breeding success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because a variety of factors including nutrition, disease, habitat, and the density of individuals all play a large role in reproductive output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reproduction is energetically costly, and physiological functions such as gonad growth and development, the growth and maintenance of secondary sexual features, and pursuing a mate, are typically only achieved by healthy individuals with an ample food supply [9, 10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An adequate food intake can also increase reproductive success by helping individuals avoid disease or predation [11, 12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, habitat must also contain appropriate nesting materials and oviposition sites, and provide food and shelter for progenywhose requirements may be vastly different to that of adults [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density of sexually mature individuals may also limit reproductive rates [14, 15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translocated populations are at particular risk of low density impacts because translocated animals are susceptible to high rates of predation and dispersal [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, whilst a created or restored habitat may look superficially the same as undisturbed habitat, there are a great number of factors required to support a self-sustaining population that may be difficult to identify without in-depth monitoring or experimentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Numerous reviews discussing the use of either translocations or created habitat suggest that increased monitoring and reporting of results, even unsuccessful ones, is vital for improving the efficiency and success of these high-level conservation programs [6, 7, 16,].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several authors also encourage an increased use of scientifically testable monitoring within a framework of a priori questions [7, 17, 18,].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This kind of targeted monitoring can provide information on how released animals are using the habitat, mechanisms driving population decline or growth, and insight into the natural history of the species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cases where reintroductions occur near extant populations of the target species, monitoring of these extant populations can be used as reference sites to strengthen tested hypotheses [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of this targeted information can be used to identify habitat features or demographic parameters that can be manipulated to increase the chance of a successful mitigation program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One species that has been the target of several habitat rehabilitation and breed and release programs for mitigation purposes, is the Australian green and golden bell frog, Litoria aurea [19, 20, 21, 22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This frog has disappeared from over 90% of its historical range, and now occurs in disjunct populations along the coast of south eastern Australia, predominantly in areas of urban or industrial development [23, 24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the large amount of effort put into the recovery of this species, success rates for habitat creation and breed and release programs are low [19, 21, 22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the high failure rate of previous offset programs for this species, we established a trial created habitat close to an extant population that enabled us to test whether the habitat created would support a viable population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst the created habitat supported the continued survival and growth of released L. aurea, three and a half years of intensive, weekly monitoring revealed no evidence of breeding on site and the sub-population cannot yet be classified as self-sustaining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lack of breeding by released animals, is a common factor attributed to the failure of multiple reintroduction programs [25, 26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to identify why our released L. aurea did not breed in the created habitat, our study compares how habitat variables, demography, and threatening processes such as the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, and predacious mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki, varied between our trial habitat, and sites where breeding did and did not occur in the natural habitat of an extant L. aurea population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Captive_breeding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Litoria aurea tadpoles were produced from a captive colony held at the University of Newcastle, using parental adults sourced at random from the population on Kooragang Island [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All breeding adults were swabbed and screened for Bd via Taqman qPCR analysis to ensure they were negative for Bd before entering the breeding colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tadpoles were also screened for Bd via mouth swabbing (described in [30]) and Taqman qPCR analysis, with at least 60 tadpoles from each breeding tank screened to confirm an absence of infection prior to release (assuming 95% confidence of detecting the presence of Bd in one animal if the fungus was present in 5% of animals [31, 32]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methods for adult swabbing and qPCR analysis are described below under the sub-headings of Field Surveys, Created habitat, and Bd Screening, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Between March 2011 and January 2012, 10,012 captive bred L. aurea tadpoles were released over two occasions into the four semi-permanent ponds and NWL (1804 tadpoles released into the fenced area, 5208 into the unfenced area, and 3000 into NWL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before release, a visible implant elastomer (VIE, Northwest Marine Technology, Shaw Island, WA, USA) was injected subcutaneously on the right side of the lower lateral ventral surface of the abdomen of each tadpole, with a unique colour used for each of the three release points (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  yellow implants for tadpoles released inside the fence, red implants for outside the fence, and green implants for NWL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These implants were conserved through metamorphosis and allowed us to see movement of animals across the site [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fauna_surveys  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Habitat_surveys  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before VES, water quality parameters including water temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen levels (DO), and conductivity were obtained with a YSI Professional Plus (Xylem, USA) water quality probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Habitat attributes were scored by estimating the percentage of habitat structures such as rocks and vegetation types, at each of the three pond sections: inside the pond, in a 2 m perimeter around the shoreline of a pond, and in a 20 m perimeter of riparian zone outside the pond, for all of the Kooragang Island natural ponds and created habitat ponds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bd_screening  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA material was collected from swab tips by extraction with PrepMan Ultra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tip of each swab was added to 50 l of PrepMan Ultra and 30 to 40 mg of Zirconium/silica beads measuring 0.5 mm diameter (Biospec Products).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were homogenised for 45 seconds in a mini beadbeater (Biospec Products), then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes in a Centurion Scientific C2 series centrifuge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homogenisation and spinning were repeated once more.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The homogenised swab tip was then immersed in a water bath set at 100°C for 10 minutes, cooled for two minutes, and then re-centrifuged for three minutes to recover all material to the bottom of the tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five l of this supernatant was added to 45 l of Milli-Q water and frozen at -80°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The quantification of Bd on each swab was determined using the TaqMan qPCR method as previously reported [41] using a Rotor Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Science).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences of the primers and probe are as follows: 5-CCTTGATATAATACAGTGTGCCATATGTC-3 (forward primer), 5-AGCCAAGAGATCCGTTGTCAAA-3 (reverse primer), 5- 6FAM CGAGTCGAACAAAAT MGBNFQ-3 (FAM-labelled TaqMan probe).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify the specificity of the primer/probe set, we compared their sequences against other biological sequences available in the Genbank database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The search resulted in a total of 57 hits, which all belong to the 5.8S rRNA-internal transcribed spacer region isolated from different strains of B. dendrobatidis, supporting the amplification specificity of the primer/probe set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 1.5-l aliquot of TaqMan Exogenous Internal Positive Control Reagents (Applied Biosystems), containing 0.5 l exogenous positive control DNA and 1 l pre-designed primers and VIC-labelled TaqMan probe (commercial sequences not provided by the manufacturer), was spiked into each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This positive control serves the purpose to distinguish true target negatives from false target negatives due to PCR inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the qPCR, the target and the positive control are co-amplified and detected by FAM and VIC fluorescence, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplification results were interpreted as follows: (1) a negative signal (CT  40) for the target and a positive signal (CT  40) for the positive control indicate the absence of the target (i.e., a true target negative); (2) negative signals for both the target and the positive control suggest a false target negative (due to PCR inhibition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples from false negatives were diluted with sterile Milli-Q water to a 1/100 solution to reduce the concentration of PCR inhibitors before they were re-analysed by qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A calibration standard with a known concentration of Bd DNA (Pisces Molecular Llc) was diluted to give 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 Bd genomic equivalents (i.e., the quantities of DNA present in 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 Bd zoospores, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This DNA dilution series was included in each qPCR run to generate a standard curve from which the quantity of Bd DNA in samples could be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all samples, a geometric mean was calculated from the three replicates (including equivocal results where at least one of the replicates returned a zero value) for the quantification purpose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Bd zoospore equivalents are calculated by multiplying the genomic equivalent values by an appropriate dilution factor which accounts for the dilution of samples made in the PCR (i.e., 10 for normal samples or 100 for samples initially determined to be false negative).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples showing zoospore equivalents 1 were considered infected (i.e., Bd-positive) whereas those with zoospore equivalents less_than1 were considered uninfected (i.e., Bd-negative).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to detect Bd with 95% confidence within each pond place, ponds that contained a high abundance of L. aurea (60 frogs [32]), and were of a comparable area to the created habitat, were selected for additional surveying and Bd screening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the two high-abundance ponds selected (one a breeding pond (S1 Fig), one a non-breeding pond (S3 Fig)), capture-mark-recapture (CMR) surveys followed immediately after the initial VES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frog capture and data collection procedures were conserved for both survey techniques, with the only difference being the length of search time: CMR surveys continued until no more frogs were observed by searchers during two consecutive perimeter searches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMR surveys were also repeated the following night for up to 7 consecutive nights, or until a 60% recapture rate was achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These additional surveys only took place during the first and last survey period of each season because Bd is no longer detectable in this population during the middle of summer, likely due to the ambient temperature exceeding the survivable tolerance limits for this pathogen [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A main dataset was built by combining survey data from pre-existing Kooragang Island ponds with survey data from the created habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Created habitat data used in this combined data set was taken from surveys conducted the same week as Kooragang Island surveys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variable of pond place was created to denote if a pond was from the created habitat (CH), or if it was a pre-existing Kooragang Island breeding pond (BP) or non-breeding pond (NBP) for L. aurea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several factors suggest that the created habitat should have been suitable for frog reproduction; released tadpoles survived through to post-metamorphosis and reproductive age, other frog species spawned in all of the created ponds, and although some water quality variables differed from other ponds on the island they were not outside of tolerance levels for L. aurea tadpoles [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were however, less reproductively available male and female L. aurea per pond in the second and third survey years which may have influenced breeding behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the greatest differences between the created habitat and natural ponds, particularly breeding ponds, were seen in vegetation composition in each of the three sampled zones, invertebrate abundance, and the prevalence of the pathogen Bd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower vegetation diversity may lead to lower invertebrate abundance and therefore lower food availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, energy from food may be used in an immune response against pathogens rather than being directed to the growth of gonads or secondary sexual traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore these two factors (nutrition and Bd) may physiologically impact the frogs ability to reproduce, and it is these physiological impacts, rather than habitat choice, that may have had the biggest impact on breeding in the created habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Demography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Litoria aurea can reach reproductive maturity within their first year, with reports of males breeding at three months post-metamorphosis, although it is more typical for males to breed at one year, and females at two [24, 37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it could be expected that breeding should have occurred at least by the third year post release of tadpoles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male L. aurea have a loud, conspicuous mating call, and usually aggregate to form choruses in the mating season [43, 44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour can lead to conspecific attraction of males towards other males to form a chorus, or females toward the chorusing males [44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As calling was significantly more frequent in breeding ponds compared to the created habitat, it is therefore possible that conspecific attraction to wild frogs drew reproductively active frogs out of the unfenced section of the created habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During our third survey season we captured juveniles in the created habitat whose genetic results suggest that at least one parent was a released frog (Valdez 2015 unpublished data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the high frequency of our tadpole surveys, and the fact that juvenile L. aurea often disperse from their natal pond [43], it is more probable that a breeding event occurred at a nearby pond, rather than occurred undetected at the created habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst this result does not reflect our aim of obtaining breeding within the created habitat, it does highlight the importance of placing reintroduction programs within close enough proximity to a metapopulation of conspecifics so that these sub-populations can support each other [45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely to be highly relevant for L. aurea as both adults [46] and juveniles [43] have been shown to disperse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dispersal however, does not explain the lack of breeding within the fenced area where frogs were contained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Female frogs are often stimulated into reproductive readiness by male calling [47], therefore the lack of calling at the created habitat may have failed to trigger female physiological responses of increased estrogen levels and egg development, and subsequent eagerness to breed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male frogs have also been found to increase androgen levels in response to conspecific calls [48], which can lead to increased testes mass [49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore a lack of calling at the trial site likely contributed to a lack of breeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst future created habitats or reintroduction programs would ideally aim to support natural frog calling, it is possible that the inclusion of artificial call-playback methods might stimulate calling behaviour, and subsequent breeding behaviour, and could be included in future management efforts [44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many frog species avoid ovipositing in ponds that contain heterospecific tadpoles to avoid increased competition or predation of their offspring at the larval stage [50, 51].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breeding by heterospecific frog species occurred at least once in each of the created habitat ponds, but was unlikely to be why L. aurea did not breed at this site because the abundance of heterospecific tadpoles was equally high in breeding ponds, and even higher in breeding ponds than non-breeding ponds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the presence of heterospecific tadpoles has a negligible effect on L. aurea when selecting an oviposition site and pond, and that co-occurring frogs may require similar habitat traits when selecting breeding ponds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results concur with previous research showing that L. aurea are more likely to breed in ponds containing a greater diversity of heterospecific amphibians [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Habitat  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Due to the placement of the created habitat in Kikuyu grass pasture, the created habitat had lower vegetation diversity and contained far fewer trees, bushes, reeds and sedges in the riparian and shoreline zones compared to the natural ponds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have found that the presence of mid-sized trees and bushes positively correlated with the presence of L. aurea in these zones [29, 53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, wetland studies have shown that terrestrial buffer zones around water bodies are extremely important for numerous amphibian species as they provide shelter from predators and desiccation when frogs are foraging or moving between sites [54, 55, 56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, L. aurea is considered a habitat generalist [29, 37] and several other studies of this species habitat, have not found a link to a particular vegetation type or community structure [43, 57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vegetation diversity is often important for invertebrate abundance and diversity [58], and can thus affect food resource availability for frogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that the created habitat had significantly lower invertebrate abundance and diversity compared to a breeding pond with higher vegetation diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Invertebrate diversity and biomass positively correlated with L. aurea growth rates in Sydney Olympic Park [59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Food and nutrient availability also has a large impact on an animals reproductive output [11, 12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, only female black bears, Ursus americanus, inhabiting areas with abundant carbohydrate food availability, were found to successfully rear offspring [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This link between energy intake and reproduction may be particularly relevant for frogs as reproduction for either sex is energetically expensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male calling to attract females, is one of the most energetically costly, male breeding behaviours in the animal kingdom [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, female frogs can produce large volumes of eggs, with L. aurea producing upwards of 3000 eggs per season, contributing to more than a quarter of their body weight [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the vegetation structure and aquatic fauna was similar both inside and outside the fenced area of the created habitat, a lack of food resources may help explain the lack of calling behaviour and breeding across both sections of the created habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to terrestrial habitat, the aquatic habitat inside ponds also contained a lower percentage of plants, and a higher percentage of open water compared to breeding ponds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because L. aurea attach their egg mass to aquatic vegetation [61], they may use the presence of emergent vegetation when selecting an oviposition site and pond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore the lack of emergent vegetation may have deterred L. aurea from selecting these ponds for breeding and promoted dispersal to other more suitable areas outside of the created habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pond size also varied significantly between the created habitat and pre-existing ponds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, created ponds were smaller than natural breeding and non-breeding ponds on the island, and dried rapidly during dry conditionsalthough water levels were manually increased to prevent complete drying within the site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suspect that the rapid water level decline, rather than pond size, deterred L. aurea from selecting the created ponds for breeding because: two natural ponds selected for breeding in this study were smaller than those within the created habitat; pond size did not correlate with L. aurea breeding patterns in previous studies [52]; and L. aurea tadpoles are poorly adapted to developing in waterbodies with decreasing water levels [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, L. aurea have been observed dispersing to ephemeral waterbodies to breed after large rain events [46], suggesting that pond hydrology is not the only factor limiting breeding within the created habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Threats  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The continued presence of L. aurea at the created habitat is a positive sign that L. aurea can persist in a created habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But the lack of breeding highlights the importance of habitat creation that facilitates all stages of a target-species life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to intensive monitoring, we were able to investigate several factors that may have contributed to the absence of L. aurea breeding at the created habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As vegetation affects invertebrate abundance, and as nutritional up-take and disease both affect reproductive behaviour and physiology, it is likely that the combination of these factors was to blame for the absence of breeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fortunately, because this created habitat was used as a trial to inform larger-scale habitat creation, we have the opportunity to build upon this knowledge and integrate what weve learnt into an improved program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future programs may benefit by the creation of ponds with more permanent hydro-periods and the placement of created habitat in close proximity to an extant population, planting a variety of plant species at each of the wetland zones (riparian, shoreline, and emergent) which may encourage oviposition and increase invertebrate abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of plants that are known to attract invertebrates might also provide additional nutrition for reproduction and immune function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recommendations to reduce Bd in the site should also be incorporated, and trialling artificial call playback may be worthwhile for stimulating breeding hormones and behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study exemplifies how monitoring and scientific analysis of a created habitat or reintroduction program can not only improve our understanding of the target species and ecological system, but also greatly improve existing, or initiate new adaptive management strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
