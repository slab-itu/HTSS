Brain basis of cognitive resilience: Prefrontal cortex predicts better reading comprehension in relation to decoding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Objective  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ultimate goal of reading is to understand written text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accomplish this, children must first master decoding, the ability to translate printed words into sounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although decoding and reading comprehension are highly interdependent, some children struggle to decode but comprehend well, whereas others with good decoding skills fail to comprehend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neural basis underlying individual differences in this discrepancy between decoding and comprehension abilities is virtually unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the neural basis underlying reading discrepancy, defined as the difference between reading comprehension and decoding skills, in a three-part study: 1) The neuroanatomical basis of reading discrepancy in a cross-sectional sample of school-age children with a wide range of reading abilities (Experiment-1; n = 55); 2) Whether a discrepancy-related neural signature is present in beginning readers and predictive of future discrepancy (Experiment-2; n = 43); and 3) Whether discrepancy-related regions are part of a domain-general or a language specialized network, utilizing the 1000 Functional Connectome data and large-scale reverse inference from Neurosynth.org (Experiment-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results converged onto the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), as related to having discrepantly higher reading comprehension relative to decoding ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased gray matter volume (GMV) was associated with greater discrepancy (Experiment-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses based on the left DLPFC cluster identified in Experiment-1 revealed that regional GMV within this ROI in beginning readers predicted discrepancy three years later (Experiment-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region was associated with the fronto-parietal network that is considered fundamental for working memory and cognitive control (Experiment-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interpretation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Processes related to the prefrontal cortex might be linked to reading discrepancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings may be important for understanding cognitive resilience, which we operationalize as those individuals with greater higher-order reading skills such as reading comprehension compared to lower-order reading skills such as decoding skills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides insights into reading development, existing theories of reading, and cognitive processes that are potentially significant to a wide range of reading disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Becoming proficient in reading comprehension relies on mastering decoding [1], a skill that enables a child to map letters to their corresponding speech sounds and meaning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, seminal frameworks in reading and its development indicate that reading comprehension is highly dependent on a readers ability to decode words accurately, fluently and effortlessly [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuroimaging studies indicated that reading comprehension and decoding activated overlapping regions [3, 4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, there are exceptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some readers show a discrepancy between reading comprehension and decoding skills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the term discrepancy has often been used to reflect differences between cognitive abilities (or aptitude such as IQ) and reading skills arising from a historical definition of dyslexia using the discrepancy criteria [5, 6], these readers have also been known as discrepant readers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While potentially confusing, for the purpose of consistency, we use the term discrepant readers to describe individuals with large differences between reading comprehension and decoding with possible discrepancy in either direction (either comprehension better than decoding or decoding better than comprehension).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two profiles that anchor the spectrum of discrepant readers: those who have low decoding, but relatively good comprehension skills, known as resilient dyslexia [710], and those who have low comprehension skills but relative good decoding known as specific reading comprehension disorder, S-RCD [1114].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aim of this study was twofold; first, to characterize the neurobiological structural of discrepant readers in children with a wide range of reading abilities; and second, to examine in an independent dataset whether the brain regions associated with reading discrepancy are a consequence of learned compensatory strategies that develop over time or whether these regions are in place prior to reading acquisition and predictive of later discrepancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although decoding and comprehension skills are typically strongly related, some readers exhibit a significant discrepancy between these skills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These discrepant readers drew the attention of researchers and educators since they highlight different mechanisms that potentially influence these skills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, most of the studies that examined factors that moderate the decoding-comprehension relationship are based on the assumptions made by the Simple View of Reading model [15, 16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to this model, reading comprehension is the product of two componentsdecoding and oral language comprehension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, according to this model, oral language comprehension is what accounts for the discrepancy in the two profiles of discrepant readers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one end of the reading discrepancy spectrum are readers with specific reading comprehension disorder (S-RCD), who struggle with reading comprehension despite adequate decoding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reading profile is observed in approximately 10% of school-aged children [13, 14, 17] and is strongly related to poor oral language skills in school [18, 19] and to a history of language impairment in preschool or kindergarten [20, 21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A contrasting profile is the resilient dyslexics, who are readers with developmental dyslexia that, despite their poor decoding skills, comprehend text relatively well [710].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such conditions have been observed in about 3% of a representative sample of university students [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy has been attributed to good oral language skills, in particular, strong semantic skills [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increasing evidence has garnered empirical findings for the unique contribution of non-linguistic skills, such as cognitive control and working memory to reading comprehension [4, 2226], providing support for the inclusion of these skills in a theoretical model of reading comprehension [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies have shown that skills such planning, shifting and, working memory have been moderately associated with reading comprehension, above and beyond skills ascribed in the Simple View of Reading model [4, 24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, S-RCD show poor performance in planning, organization, and working memory tasks [14, 2628].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, good performance in these skills have been found to play a compensatory role for children with low decoding skills [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These skills of cognitive control and working memory may enable readers to develop and revise plans for reading a text, making inferences by integrating incoming information with prior knowledge as well as previously read text information, and inhibit ideas or information not textually relevant during reading [24, 3032].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sparse neuroimaging evidence limits a cohesive and comprehensive understanding of the neural architecture that supports such reading discrepancies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuroimaging studies indicate that reading comprehension and decoding activate overlapping regions, yet comprehension elicits a broader network that supports language and cognitive control [3, 4, 33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a handful of studies that examined discrepant readers show associations between reading discrepancy and right inferior frontal regions [17, 34, 35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One study found adult resilient dyslexics and proficient readers to show greater radial expansion in the right inferior frontal region, which is a measure of local brain size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was attributed to reflect good comprehension [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two studies using structural and functional MRI comparing S-RCD, dyslexic readers, and proficient readers indicated that readers with S-RCD might have a distinct profile from the dyslexic readers and proficient readers (15, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Occipito-temporal region and the supramarginal gyrus, which have been associated with orthographic and phonological processing, were found to differentiate between the dyslexic group and the other groups that included S-RCD and proficient readers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the S-RCD group compared to the other groups showed additional reduced gray matter in the right frontal areas and anomalies in connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus when reading low versus high frequency words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These regions are known to be important for semantic processing and executive functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these studies reflect behavioral findings of resilient dyslexia and S-RCD, which suggest that whereas resilient dyslexics showed only anomalies in regions related to processing of phonological and orthographic forms, the S-RCD showed anomalies in regions related to semantic processing and executive functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no study has examined the neurobiological structure of discrepant readers along the entire continuum from poor to typical decoding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, results from behavioral studies that encompass discrepancy in decoding and reading comprehension have not been consistent in whether language or cognitive measures contribute to this discrepancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is possibly due to differences in sample composition among other possible factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is unknown whether anomalies in these regions precede or follow the development of this discrepancy as children learn to read.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, it is unknown if the findings are a secondary consequence of the enhanced use of compensatory strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Past studies were done in older children and adults, already with years of formal reading instruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in beginning readers that track the development of discrepancy is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the current study, we therefore investigated the brain basis underlying discrepancy between decoding and reading comprehension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first examined the associations between reading discrepancy and gray matter volume (GMV) in school-age children with a wide range of reading abilities (Experiment-1; n = 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that if discrepancy is mediated by a domain-specific language network, as the Simple View of Reading suggests, key findings would converge in brain structures associated with language and oral comprehension [15, 16] such as the left inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, if discrepancy is mediated by domain-general networks associated with cognitive control and working memory [4, 22, 23], structures such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) would be involved [17, 35, 37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then investigated whether the neuroanatomical region that we found associated with reading discrepancy, preceded or followed reading discrepancy and if it is secondary to literacy acquisition (Experiment-2, n = 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined whether these brain structures in beginning readers predict the development of discrepancy when they become proficient readers using regions identified in Experiment-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to determine whether discrepancy-related regions are part of a domain-general network or a language network, we used a large-scale neuroimaging database (Experiment-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This methodology offers the opportunity to perform comprehensive analyses of reverse inference to identify the psychological contributions of a given brain region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is commonly used to decide among competing theories of human behavior [38, 39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we used the Neurosynth database that included the 1000 Functional Connectome Project [40] to analyze resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) from the region identified as the discrepancy-related anatomical cluster found in Experiment-1 as the seed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then applied large-scale reverse inferences to the rsFC circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In the final set of analyses, we used Neurosynth [40] to attribute function to the results obtained from the experiments above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Neurosynth database (as of July 2015) contains meta-analytic maps for 3169 terms, automatically derived from coordinates reported in 11,406 papers from selected journals, with a high incidence of functional neuroimaging papers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the function of resting state networks associated with the left DLPFC cluster found in Experiment-1, using the 1000 Functional Connectome data [66] included in Neurosynth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The map of the average voxel-wise rsFC across 1,000 subjects between the center of gravity (COG) of the left DLPFC region and the rest of the brain was thresholded at a moderate effect size of r  greater than  0.30 as in prior studies [67], to limit the analysis to regions that were strongly connected to the seed, and Fisher-transformed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The voxel-by-voxel values from the resulting rsFC map and reverse inference map for each term were correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting correlation values are plotted against each key term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reverse inference analyses, we omitted anatomical terms (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dorsolateral, prefrontal) and averaged terms with common roots or abbreviated forms (e.g., working memory and memory wm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each term and voxel within a 2mm resolution standard MNI space, reverse inference maps were constructed by calculating the posterior probability of a term occurring in the text of a study given reported coordinates within 10mm of the voxel, using a uniform prior on term occurrences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Demographic and behavioral data as well as correlations between measures are included in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DECODE was highly correlated with COMP (r = 0.67, p less_than 0.001; Fig 1, red markers; Table 1), similar to the correlations found in a behavioral meta-analysis of 110 studies [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Discrepancy index (DiscInd) ranged between -32 and 23SS and was positively correlated with reading comprehension measures such as COMP (WRMT-PC) and GORT-COMP, but not with decoding as measured by DECODE (WRMT-WA) or TOWRE-PDE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DiscInd was associated with language, reading and cognitive skills such as vocabulary (PPVT), reading fluency (GORT rate), and short-term memory span (CTOPP-MD) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out of the 12 children with lower reading comprehension relative to their decoding skills, 5 children (41.6%) had a PPVT score lower than 85SS; for those with better reading comprehension relative to their decoding skills, only one child (out of 15, 6.7%) had a PPVT lower than 85SS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is not surprising based on previous studies that showed approximately half of the S-RCD samples also had language impairment [1921].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experiment-2__Investigation_of_chicken_or_egg_in_a_longitudinal_study_of_beginning_readers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address whether greater left DLPFC GMV found in Experiment-1 predates reading acquisition and is more causally related to discrepancy, or is due to secondary consequences or literacy experience, we examined whether left DLPFC GMV in beginning kindergarteners can predict reading discrepancy 3 years later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behaviorally, as in the other dataset, DECODE was significantly correlated with COMP (Time 1, r = 0.79, p less_than 0.001; Time 2, r = 0.67, p less_than 0.001, see Fig 1, green; Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike Experiment-1 where DiscInd correlated positively with COMP but not with DECODE, in this sample, DiscInd was not associated with DECODE or with COMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time 2 DiscInd was negatively correlated with Time 2 DECODE and with another measure of nonword reading (TOWRE-PDE) (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither Time 1 DiscInd nor other Time 1 behavioral measures predicted Time 2 DiscInd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ROI analysis within the DLPFC cluster derived from Experiment-1 examining the effect of DiscInd indicated that Time 1 left DLPFC GMV in beginning readers was positively associated with Time 2 DiscInd (peak left MFG MNI x = -50, y = 30, z = 27, Z = 3.57, p less_than 0.05 corrected, 416 voxels) (Fig 2B-1, green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, Time 1 left DLPFC GMV did not correlate with DECODE or COMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, positive correlation in the left DLPFC remained significant even after partialling out key factors (IQ, reading fluency and DiscInd at Time 1 as well as duration between Time 1 and 2) (peak left MFG MNI x = -50, y = 30, z = 27, Z = 3.32, p less_than 0.05 corrected, 137 voxels) or controlling for individual difference in reading skills at the early stages of reading acquisition (peak left MFG MNI x = -50, y = 30, z = 27, Z = 3.87, p less_than 0.05 corrected, 456 voxels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further, we tested whether family history of reading difficulties interacted with reading discrepancy in regional GMV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean GMV in left DLPFC derived from the basic analysis of Experiment-2 was only correlated with DiscInd ( = 0.55, t = 2.51, p = 0.017) and was not correlated with Family History ( = 0.09, t = -0.627, p = 0.53) or the DiscInd x Family History interaction ( = 0.035, t = 0.16, p = 0.86) (Fig 2B-2, green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experiment-3__Domain-general_versus_domain-specific_language_processes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the resting state fMRI data from the 1000 Functional Connectome Project [66] with the aforementioned left DLPFC identified in Experiment-1 (COG of cluster: MNI x = -40, y = 38, z = 16) as a seed voxel revealed a bilateral (left  greater than  right) fronto-parietal network including superior frontal gyri, insula, and supramarginal gyri [66] (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reverse inference of the rsFC network associated with the DLPFC cluster identified two terms that related to cognitive control (executive) or working memory (working memory) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A large number of studies have investigated the neural correlates of developmental reading disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, only few studies examined the neural basis of readers that show a discrepancy between two important reading skills: decoding and reading comprehension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these skills are highly related, the existence of discrepant readers suggests that there are additional skills important to becoming proficient at reading comprehension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our main goal was to fill this gap and examine the neural basis that underlie the discrepancy between decoding skills and reading comprehension in children with a wide range of reading abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In all the experiments, we found converging evidence of the left DLPFC to be critical in the development of having discrepantly higher reading comprehension relative to their decoding ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in school-age children with a wide range of reading abilities, the left DLPFC GMV was associated with increased discrepancy between reading comprehension and decoding above and beyond contributions from decoding, reading comprehension measures, diagnosis of dyslexia and other related reading and cognitive skills (Experiment-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This association with the left DLPFC was similar across the entire continuum of reading discrepancy, with those having low decoding skills but relatively good comprehension skills at one end and those with good decoding skills but poor comprehension skills at the other end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When confounding variables (nonverbal IQ and reading fluency) were controlled, this relationship remained significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in a small and preliminary study reported in the S1 File, resilient dyslexics (i.e, those with poor decoding but with, unexpectedly, good reading comprehension) had greater left DLPFC GMV compared to both groups of children matched for poor decoding (i.e., those with poor, but no discrepancy) and those matched for good reading comprehension (i.e., those with good decoding was also good, also without a discrepancy), providing further evidence that the left DLPFC uniquely contributes to this discrepancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second and most intriguingly, using a longitudinal design in beginning readers (56 year old), a region within the left DLPFC that was identified in Experiment-1 predicted reading discrepancy 3 years later, above and beyond reading skills at the beginning stages of reading (Experiment-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When confounding variables (IQ, reading fluency, DiscInd at Time 1 as well as duration between Time 1 and 2) were controlled, this relationship remained significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the findings showing that reading group (dyslexia or family history) did not interact with GMV, as well as the fact that all the participants in Experiment-2 had within or above normal decoding skills, support that the left DLPFC is not specific to dyslexic readers, but also to individuals across a range of decoding skills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the seed voxel connectivity analysis using the 1000 Functional Connectome data identified the left DLPFC node to be part of the fronto-parietal network (Experiment-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within a meta-analytic reverse inference framework, the fronto-parietal network derived from rsFC was related only to domain-general processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings indicate that a left DLPFC network critical for memory and cognitive control may play a key role in the development of reading comprehension regardless of decoding, even before a child becomes a proficient reader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is currently unclear how the left DLPFC mediates the discrepancy between decoding skills and reading comprehension abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DLPFC network has been found to be involved in decoding, dyslexia [68, 69], reading comprehension [70, 71], and in the decodingreading comprehension discrepancy, when reading comprehension is discrepantly high (resilient dyslexics) [34] to low (S-RCD) [17, 35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these studies did not address questions such as the brain regions that are unique to the comprehension-decoding discrepancy, the role of these brain regions, specifically whether DLPFC accounts for the development of good comprehension despite poor decoding, and whether the involvement of DLPFC is associated with long-term reading experience (or lack of it thereof) and a secondary consequence of the enhanced use of compensatory strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible functional role of this brain region was identified through Experiment-3, where fronto-parietal networks, identified using rsFC, were associated with working memory and cognitive control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, these cognitive processes may be key constructs enabling children to be proficient in higher level reading processes (comprehension) despite their relatively poor abilities in lower level reading processes (decoding).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding corroborates with the significant behavioral correlation of DiscInd and the verbal short-term memory span (Experiment-1) which reflects that the ability to temporarily hold verbal information and is considered to be a subsystem to the working memory [72, 73] Moreover, previous behavioral studies indicate that working memory and cognitive control play crucial roles in moderating reading comprehension and decoding relationships [24, 48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, planning abilities, attention and working memory, have shown to support reading comprehension directly above and beyond foundational reading and language abilities [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, children with S-RCD show prominent weaknesses in executive function [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intervention studies report that training working memory enhances reading abilities [74], although it is controversial [75].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiment-3 supports the notion that language skills alone cannot account for the comprehension-decoding discrepancy and suggests the importance of further research to examine the role of cognitive skills in this discrepancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are in line with a recently proposed theoretical framework, suggesting that a core set of 'language' regions may interact functionally with a set of domain-general regions during the performance of language tasks [76].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, left DLPFC may provide top-down and predictive strategies for language comprehension [77].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our longitudinal findings show that, as children begin formal reading instruction in kindergarten, individual differences in left DLPFC GMV are predictive of who will become better reading comprehenders above and beyond their decoding ability, at an age when they are expected to be proficient readers (Experiment-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the preliminary findings of the S1 File that show uniquely greater left DLPFC GMV in resilient dyslexics compared to two control groups, it is possible that differences in DLPFC at beginning stages of reading enable buffering of superior reading comprehension abilities relative to their level of decoding, and even when the decoding skills are poor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study contributes to the brain and cognitive reserve framework, as well as to our recent proposal for a framework of cognitive (and socio-emotional) resilience in dyslexia [78].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reserve has been proposed mostly in the aging literature as a cognitive and/or neural mechanism that allows some to cope better than others despite similar brain deficits [79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our recent proposal of cognitive resilience in dyslexia has been suggested that several cognitive processes act as protective factors that reduce the severity of dyslexia [78].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of relevance, executive functions were found to be key protective factors [8082].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that the left DLPFC GMV boosts reading comprehension above and beyond decoding is in alignment with previous studies in adults that found the left DLPFC network to be a key region important for cognitive resilience [83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study suggests, for the first time, a role of the PFC that may buffer children to outperform in reading comprehension given a certain proficiency in decoding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, we present the first evidence in neurodevelopmental disorders that supports the idea of brain reserve [84] and first imaging evidence of the neural correlates of cognitive resilience in dyslexia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of importance, understanding the neural systems underlying individual differences in the reading comprehension-decoding relationship may refine theoretical models of reading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expanding the Simple View of Reading [15, 16], Cutting et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [85] suggests that executive function facilitates the growth and intertwining of decoding and language abilities to achieve skilled reading comprehension [25, 85].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, Perfettis reading system framework [86, 87] proposes that the lexicon mediates the relationship between decoding and reading comprehension, and that reading requires integration between language knowledge (e.g., letter knowledge, facts about the world) with reading processes (e.g., decoding, comprehension monitoring; see in Fig 4, blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A complementary model, the Construction-Integration Model by Kintsch and colleagues, proposed that working memory plays a critical role in this integration [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of these models, findings from the current study supports the idea that the left DLPFC is associated with discrepancy for the entire spectrum of decoding ability (Experiment-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relevant to these models, our findings also indicate that the left DLPFC is associated with discrepancy rather than decoding or reading comprehension on their own (Experiment-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resilient dyslexics had greater left DLPFC even compared to good comprehenders who had similar (and above) reading comprehension abilities along with good decoding skills (S1 File), and the left DLPFC region was associated only with discrepancy and not with reading comprehension or decoding 3 years later (Experiment-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with results from the reverse inference linking the left fronto-parietal network to cognitive control and working memory (Experiment-3), our findings may imply that domain-general processes influence reading comprehension (Fig 4, single-lined red arrow), but also strongly modify the strength of the relation between decoding and reading comprehension (Fig 4, double-lined red arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that greater cognitive resources serve to boost reading comprehension, given a limited level of decoding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not find the DLPFC to be involved in decoding with the current threshold, (but it is involved when a smaller smoothing kernel is used), which is in line with previous studies that also showed the involvement of the DLPFC network in reading comprehension but not decoding (or only weak relationships).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3, 33, 85]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Reading System Framework by Perfetti is represented in blue lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It emphasizes the lexical component that mediates decoding, reading comprehension and the integration between language knowledge with reading processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current findings are represented in red lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They indicate that the left DLPFC network, and possibly by inference, cognitive control and working memory, influence reading comprehension (single-lined red arrow), also strongly modify the strength of the relation between the two (double-lined red arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

While the current study is the first comprehensive report on the neurobiological substrates of reading discrepancy, it has several limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a major limitation of this study is the few behavioral measures on working memory that could have been used to directly test the process underlying reading discrepancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that we have minimized this issue by using an approach that combines 1000 Functional Connectome data and large-scale reverse inference using Neurosynth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future investigations should include measures such as language, executive functions, and task-driven functional neural circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, since our overall sample sizes were relatively small, we could not conduct between-group analyses comparing for example, unique profiles of reading disorders such as resilient dyslexics and S-RCD (but see S1 File).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further investigations, including larger groups of resilient dyslexics, poor comprehenders, and non-discrepant good and poor readers, are warranted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we used a liberal primary threshold of p less_than 0.01 uncorrected for height when computing a corrected threshold at p = 0.05, which could be a source of inflated false positive rates [59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our use of a large smoothing kernel (resulting in a smoothness of approximately 16mm FWHM) minimizes this issue by imposing a Gaussian spatial correlation structure (and stationarity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a larger degree of smoothing than typically employed in 2mm3 fMRI data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is possible that VBM smoothness is not approximated by a Gaussian, we are unaware of any studies of the smoothness distribution in VBM data, particularly the presence of the long-tailed distribution found in fMRI data that is particularly problematic for cluster-based thresholding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies with larger groups of children would help to produce these analyses with a more stringent statistical threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, temporal precedence in beginning readers (Experiment-2) does not imply causation, and future examination is warranted prior to attribution of causality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifth, we calculated the main dependent measure (DiscInd) by the difference between DECODE and COMP to enhance generalizability of our findings (see Experiment-1 Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We nevertheless performed the alternative analysis as well, calculating residuals of COMP partialling out DECODE (Fig 2A-2), and found similar results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we would ultimately need updated computational models and formal theories to explain our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our comprehensive neuroimaging examination of reading-discrepancy using good to poor and beginning to advanced readers, with cross-sectional and longitudinal data, converged on the left DLPFC as one key anatomical region that buffered children from having poor reading comprehension skills that might be expected based on their decoding ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, a domain-general network including a left DLPFC node appears to play a protective role that aids reading comprehension in the face of poor(er) decoding abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings also demonstrate the prognostic capabilities of brain imaging by showing how left DLPFC volume in beginning readers was associated with discrepancy three years later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our study provides insight into reading development, and refines existing theories of reading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, with future work in larger samples of resilient dyslexics and replication as well as prospective intervention studies, the current study can potentially inform the practice of reading disorders, especially as it relates to thinking about strategies to improve the downstream negative consequences of decoding difficulties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
