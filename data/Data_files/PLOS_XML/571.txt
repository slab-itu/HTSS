A Critical Evaluation of the Down Syndrome Diagnosis for LB1, Type Specimen of Homo floresiensis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Liang Bua hominins from Flores, Indonesia, have been the subject of intense scrutiny and debate since their initial description and classification in 2004.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These remains have been assigned to a new species, Homo floresiensis, with the partial skeleton LB1 as the type specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Liang Bua hominins are notable for their short stature, small endocranial volume, and many features that appear phylogenetically primitive relative to modern humans, despite their late Pleistocene age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, some workers suggested that the remains represent members of a small-bodied island population of modern Austro-Melanesian humans, with LB1 exhibiting clinical signs of Down syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many classic Down syndrome signs are soft tissue features that could not be assessed in skeletal remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a definitive diagnosis of Down syndrome can only be made by genetic analysis as the phenotypes associated with Down syndrome are variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most features that contribute to the Down syndrome phenotype are not restricted to Down syndrome but are seen in other chromosomal disorders and in the general population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we re-evaluated the presence of those phenotypic features used to support this classification by comparing LB1 to samples of modern humans diagnosed with Down syndrome and euploid modern humans using comparative morphometric analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present new data regarding neurocranial, brain, and symphyseal shape in Down syndrome, additional estimates of stature for LB1, and analyses of inter- and intralimb proportions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of cranial sinuses is addressed using CT images of LB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found minimal congruence between the LB1 phenotype and clinical descriptions of Down syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present important differences between the phenotypes of LB1 and individuals with Down syndrome, and quantitative data that characterize LB1 as an outlier compared with Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homo floresiensis remains a phenotypically unique, valid species with its roots in Plio-Pleistocene Homo taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interpretation of the Late Pleistocene Flores hominins has been controversial since their initial description in 2004 as a distinct species, Homo floresiensis [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The many phylogenetically primitive features observed in the Flores specimens relative to modern humans suggest that their ancestry is rooted in Plio-Pleistocene Homo, perhaps H. erectus or H. habilis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since its discovery, workers have confirmed that cranial and endocranial shape and many cranial characteristics of LB1 correspond to classic H. erectus characters [25], while some postcranial and mandibular features, such as the interlimb proportions and symphyseal shape are more primitive than H. erectus, and more closely resemble early Homo or even australopiths [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cladistic analyses placed the origin of H. floresiensis earlier than the origin of H. erectus [9, 10], but both a H. erectus or an early Homo origin would imply evolutionary convergences in morphology [11, 12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the same time, a minority of workers maintains that the Flores hominins are small-bodied modern humans, and, at least in the case of the most complete specimen, LB1, pathologically altered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several clinical signs (e.g., microcephaly) and specific pathologies (endemic hypothyroidism, Laron syndrome) have been proposed [1318] and subsequently rejected [1924].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most recently, Henneberg, Eckhardt [25] reported that LB1 manifested many clinical signs of Down syndrome (DS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide an overview of the DS phenotype, and re-evaluate the evidence presented by Henneberg, Eckhardt [25] in support of this diagnosis for LB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stratigraphic layers containing H. floresiensis were initially dated to 9574 to 12 kyr [1, 26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This chronology was recently revised to 100 to 60 kyr based on a better understanding of the cave geology and more extensive dating of the H. floresiensis fossils themselves, as well as sediment and speleothems of these layers and overlying tephra [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dates are internally consistent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dates associated with tools thought to be manufactured by this species may extend the range from 190 to 50 kyr [27, 28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern human remains are not documented in the broader region of Southeast Asia and Australia until 5045 kyr [2931].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to the extent that this new chronology accurately reflects the true dates of occupation of the region, there was no temporal overlap between H. floresiensis and H. sapiens on Flores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Liang Bua remains consist, in part, of a fairly complete skeleton with a cranium and mandible, assigned to LB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LB1 is the holotype for the species Homo floresiensis and presents the only cranium thus far recovered [1] (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LB6 individual presents additional evidence in the form of a mandible and numerous postcranial bones [1, 26, 32, 33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mandibular anatomy of LB1 and LB6 are quite comparable [8] (Fig 1), and the postcranial elements of BL6 and other individuals from the site further confirm that this population was small-bodied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Down_syndrome_and_paleopathology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Down syndrome, described in 1866 by John Langdon Down [34], is caused by trisomy of some or all of chromosome 21 (and is also known as Trisomy 21) through non-disjunction or, more rarely, translocation, and is seen in 1/600-1/2000 live births [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than 100 clinical signs are reported to be associated with DS, many of which are used in fetal diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the combination of many clinical features are characteristic of DS, a valid diagnosis requires karyotype, an option that is not available in the case of the subfossils from Flores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the clinical signs of DS are soft tissue characteristics which cannot be assessed in fossils, such as a single palmar crease, up-slanting palpebral fissures, and a protruding tongue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DS is a highly heterogeneous condition and although skeletal features are noted (brachycephaly, maxillary retrusion), there is no single, diagnostic skeletal phenotype present in all individuals with DS that distinguishes these individuals from the rest of the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, many of the clinical signs of DS are not unique to this syndrome but are present in other syndromes (e.g., midfacial hypoplasia, microcephaly) or, in some cases, are part of the normal range of variation in euploid (having a balanced set of chromosomes) individuals (e.g., flat foot, occlusal abnormalities, Brushfield spots, cardiac septation defects) (see also [36]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chen [37] advises that 8 characteristic clinical findings of DS should be present for a clinical DS diagnosis, but that chromosomal analysis is preferred and necessary in uncertain cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a large number of DS signs must be positively identified if a definite diagnosis of DS is to be accepted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major reference works on paleopathology in osteological remains provide limited assistance as they either do not address DS explicitly [38, 39] or do not indicate which skeletal features in isolation or combination are sufficient for a differential diagnosis [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This type of analysis is not, however, without precedent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 7200-year-old skeleton from the site of Santa Rosa Island, CA was notable in its metopism, flat cranial base, wide interorbital distance, reduced facial height, dental anomalies and small postcranial elements (estimated stature of 154 cm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors noted that these features were consistent with four syndromes including DS, and concluded that This case illustratessome of the difficulties of diagnosing craniofacial syndromes in prehistoric skeletal remains ([41], p. 179).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rivollat et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [42] identified a child from the French medieval site of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes as having DS on the basis of craniofacial and dental characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rivollat et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [42] identified differences in the Saint-Jean-des-Vignes skull relative to a non-pathological reference sample and then assessed the differences with descriptions and measurements of DS available from the clinical literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single individual from Tauberbischofsheim, Germany was diagnosed with DS by Czarnetzki et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [43] out of the 7000 examined in the time period 3200 BC-AD 800 in Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They used five 2D landmarks from the median facial profile, but did not provide images or methodological details, including evidence that this facial profile was distinct from other disorders with midfacial hypoplasia (i.e., Achondroplasia or Crouzon syndrome).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most thorough archaeological diagnosis of DS was published by Brothwell [44], who identified a probable case of DS in a Saxon child based on comparisons of craniodental traits with other member of its population and comparative DS material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such traits as microcephaly, hyperbrachycephaly, thin cranial bones, small maxilla but not mandible and dental irregularities were most concordant with DS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the author considers the upright basi-occipital to be indicative of DS, this feature, along with a low spheno-ethmoidal angle, may suggest a highly flexed cranial base, which is actually at odds with the typical DS phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brothwell ([44], p. 49) emphasizes that It is important in this type of analysis to consider all the features together, rather than attempt to isolate one special characteristic feature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study differs from these studies in that it does not seek to make a clinical diagnosis but rather to refute an existing diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, a similar comparative approach, evaluating morphological features of LB1 against both the DS and euploid phenotypes with an emphasis on those features that most clearly differentiate these two groups and are found at a high frequency in DS, is used here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many, but not all, of these traits were also discussed by Henneberg, Eckhardt [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, this is an imperfect approach as we have previously described and quantified the many ways in which LB1 does not fit within the modern human range of variation but is rather aligned more closely with archaic Homo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One problem this poses is that LB1 may not fit within either the modern euploid or DS range of variation and instead be an outlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, it is possible that LB1 could converge on features in DS for reasons that are not related to a chromosomal abnormality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, LB1 converges in some aspects of cranial shape with humans exhibiting extreme microcephaly due to its probably ancestry from a small-brained early Homo species [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These issues must be born in mind while interpreting the results of the comparative analyses presented below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Down_syndrome_and_LB1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of some characteristic features of DS in LB1 is insufficient to confirm a diagnosis of DS, and, conversely, the absence of some signs is insufficient to reject a DS diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, we must be satisfied to judge the likelihood of DS based on assessment of those DS signs that are evaluable in the hard tissues preserved for LB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of all or most of these signs would indicate a lowered probability of DS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A summary of features seen more commonly in individuals with DS than in the general population that are potentially discernable in skeletal or dental remains are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only those dental features specifically mentioned by Henneberg et al [25] are included in Table 1, but additional dental traits are listed in S1 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many cases these signs were identified and evaluated at the fetal, newborn or juvenile stage, and it is not clear that they remain valid markers of the adult DS phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, brachymesophalangia-5 is more common in young individuals with DS and there is some evidence that this condition may become normalized during subsequent growth and development [45, 46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the flaring ilia of the pelvis are also more diagnostic at fetal and infant stages than in adults with DS [47, 48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identification of LB1 as exhibiting a DS phenotype was previously rebutted by Westaway, Durband [70] with regard to the mandibular evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional preliminary critiques were offered by Argue [71] and Baab et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide comparative analyses of linear and volumetric measurements of the endocast, neurocranial and symphyseal shape, stature, intralimb proportions and digit length among samples of individuals with a documented diagnosis of DS, samples of euploid individuals, and LB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also provide new images derived from CT data that shed light on the presence of cranial sinuses and re-evaluate the evidence regarding the foot:femur (foot:thigh) ratio in LB1 and individuals with DS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some additional features discussed by Henneberg, Eckhardt [25] were re-evaluated using the extensive DS literature and results are presented in the accompanying Supplemental Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This re-evaluation reveals the improbability of a diagnosis of DS based on a synthesis of the clinical literature on DS with comparative analyses of new morphometric evidence from LB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although a concrete diagnosis of DS can only be accomplished through genetic testing, we critically evaluated whether the skeletal anatomy of LB1 is compatible with the DS phenotype as proposed by Henneberg et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated novel data sets related to endocranial volume, neurocranial and symphyseal shape in DS, as well as new stature estimations for LB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were unable to verify more than marginal overlap between the LB1 and DS phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several instances, Henneberg et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [25] described morphologies in LB1 that superficially resembled features seen in DS, but actually reflected different underlying phenotypes, including atlanto-occipital abnormality and flat feet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, neither of these features were directly evaluable in LB1 as they relate to soft tissue structures, as is also the case for microgenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other cases, qualitative similarity was not borne out by quantitative analyses, such as small brain, short stature, brachycephaly, and short femora.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of facial asymmetry, Henneberg et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [25] conflated previous measures of fluctuating asymmetry of the face (soft tissues) in a sample of people with DS with asymmetry of the LB1 facial skeleton (discussed in S1 Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were a small number of cases where the results were more ambiguous and require careful consideration, such as short manual digits, aplastic / hypoplastic cranial sinuses and tooth agenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The clinical literature suggests that some or many DS individuals are characterized by a slightly smaller than average brain size (and accompanying head circumference).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cranium is often described as brachycephalic with a flat cranial base, a hypoplastic midface and disproportionately small maxilla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mandible is usually of normal size but individuals with DS may present with microgenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DS individuals are further characterized by reduced stature and higher foot:femur or fleshy foot:thigh ratios than euploid control groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, the greatly reduced brain size (EV = ~417 cm3) and head circumference of LB1 mark this individual as an outlier relative to those DS individuals evaluated here whose values are much closer to control samples of euploid individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the low and poorly filled out cranial vault of LB1 contrasts sharply with samples of both DS and euploid modern humans who are themselves quite similar, and is more similar to H. erectus [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cranial base of LB1 is not flat, and its cranial base angle overlaps the euploid but not the DS range of values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anteriorly projecting face and posteriorly sloping frontal squama of LB1 do not match descriptions of DS individuals but are common in archaic Homo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The posteriorly sloping anterior symphysis of the mandible lacks the elements of a bony chin present in euploid and DS samples, and exhibits both superior and inferior tori on its posterior surface, features that align it more clearly with early hominins than with either DS or euploid humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The short stature (just over 1 m) and disproportionately short lower limbs reveal further evidence of a primitive body shape that does not overlap ranges of variation for either DS or euploid samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These examples confirm that the LB1 phenotype (and that of other Liang Bua fossils assigned to H. floresiensis) is better interpreted as a distinct species whose affinities lie with early Homo species than as a member of H. sapiens with DS or any other pathology proposed thus far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LB1s cranial morphology can be compared to descriptions and images of crania previously diagnosed with DS in the archaeological record from England (a Saxon burial) [44] and France [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Brothwell [44] and Rivollat et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [42] cited brachycephaly, a flat posterior vault / occiput, thin cranial bones, reduced facial height and dental anomalies in support of their DS diagnoses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This brachycephaly is not accompanied by a dramatic decrease in cranial height nor by a posterior sloping of the forehead [44], both features that distinguish LB1 from the Saxon and French juvenile crania.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the strongly flexed occipital bone with a transverse torus and thick cranial bones in LB1 contrast with these DS diagnoses (S1 Table) [1, 8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That said, we do not expect that all individuals with DS would present identical morphologies given that DS is highly heterogenous [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the Saxon and French juveniles differ from one another in features such as cranial base flexion and microcephaly and some features in each more closely resemble the euploid than the DS condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in both cases there are numerous craniodental characteristics that frequently differentiate DS from euploid individuals, which is not the case for LB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the case of short manual digits, we found that the distal phalanges of the Liang Bua hominins were short by modern human standards but in most cases those of LB1 were within the modern human range, particularly when scaled by humeral length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we are uncertain what digit most phalanges belong to, we cannot conclusively state whether they are long or short with comparison to modern human populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of quantitative data on DS digit length further complicates interpretation of this pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is particularly notable that LB6, a second individual from Liang Bua cave that was not diagnosed with DS, had even shorter distal phalanges than LB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that this is a population characteristic rather than an abnormal condition in LB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The issue of small or missing paranasal sinuses remains only partially resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most commonly missing sinus in DS is the frontal sinus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A centrally positioned frontal sinus cannot be directly evaluated due to excavator damage in the median plane of LB1, but Balzeau and Charlier [89] found no evidence of pneumatization in the vicinity using micro-CT data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The less damaged right supraorbital torus was previously described as containing a frontal sinus [19, 20], but this was questioned by Balzeau and Charlier [89] using their higher resolution dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frontal sinus aplasia cannot therefore be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maxillary sinuses are present (ruling out aplasia) and do not appear especially small relative to overall facial size, also excluding a diagnosis of Type III maxillary sinus hypoplasia (cleft-like).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Establishing the presence of Type I or II maxillary sinus hypoplasia would require evaluation of delicate internal structures such as the uncinate process and infundibular passage, as well as soft tissue opacification, neither of which can be assessed currently [122].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There appears to be a sphenoid sinus, but its boundaries and position relative to the sella turcica (the landmark used most commonly in the clinical literature) are challenging to clearly identify.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, evidence from the cranial sinuses neither strongly supports nor refutes a DS diagnosis for LB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We provided vital contextual information about the distribution of periodontal disease and dental caries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This context indicates that the presence of periodontal disease and lack of caries in LB1 is not uncommon in archaic hominins or modern hunter-gatherer populations, and, in the absence of a host of other common DS dental anomalies, is not convincing evidence of DS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also evaluated a number of dental features common in DS not seen in LB1, such as microdontia, tooth transposition, mandibular and maxillary incisor protrusion, and Angles class III malocclusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were unable to confirm claims that LB1 presented with taurdontism as do some DS individuals, but could not fully evaluate this feature with available radiographs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Failure of permanent teeth to develop is a common finding in individuals with DS, and LB1 is missing a right P4 and M3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains unclear whether the P4 failed to develop or was lost during life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than one third molar was affected in nearly all cases of third molar agenesis in DS (95%) documented by Shapira et al [123] in contrast to the single tooth missing in LB1, and Suri et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [54] found that an average of 4.74 teeth were missing in DS patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the third molar is the most common tooth absent due to agenesis in the general population, with ~30% of some Asian populations exhibiting M3/M3 agenesis [124].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likely instances of third molar absence have also been documented in fossil hominins, including early H. erectus [125127].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypodontia affects between 2.811.3% of the general population, and the same teeth are most often involved as in DS [107, 124, 128].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DS is a phenotypically variable disorder and its clinical signs are neither unique to this disorder nor universally expressed in all individuals with DS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it is not necessary for LB1 to exhibit all hard tissue features that are consistent in modern individuals with DS to posit the presence of this chromosomal disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the presence of only a handful of features is insufficient to confirm a differential diagnosis of DS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the clinical signs associated with DS, only short distal phalanges, M3 agenesis, possibly hypodontia and possibly hypoplasia of one or more cranial sinuses was consistent with this diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This list of features are not unique to DS and are not among the most diagnostic (e.g., midfacial hypoplasia).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, combined with the large number of features common to the DS phenotype that were not present in LB1, indicates that it is highly unlikely that this individual had Trisomy 21 or DS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LB1 remains the type specimen of H. floresiensis, a species with its roots in Plio-Pleistocene Homo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Material_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CT_and_MRI_data_of_DS_patients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data on 28 patients with a clinical (or karyotypic) diagnosis of DS and without other abnormal morphologies were acquired from Barnes-Jewish-Christian Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri (CT data) and from Richard Haiers research group at University of California, Irvine (MRI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Washington University School of Medicine IRB committee approved the analysis of de-identified CT data for this study (IRB ID #: 201410059: title "Down's syndrome and Hobbit").  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Midwestern University IRB committee determined that use of the MRI data did not meet the definition of human subjects research and did not require additional approval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter images were originally acquired to identify indicators in the brain for Alzheimers in middle-aged adults with DS [129].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface renderings of the neurocranium were generated using the Mimics software package for subsequent landmark analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details are provided in the S1 Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Endocranial_measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Virtual endocasts were created for the six DS females for whom CT data were available (age range: 1067 years) following previously described methods [130], from which four linear measurements and endocranial volume (EV) were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LB1s value was compared with the mean value for our six subjects with DS for each measurement, and descriptive statistics were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested the null hypothesis that the LB1 value was not lower than the mean value for our 6 DS subjects (one-tailed test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because six t tests were performed, to protect against Type I error, statistical levels of significance were corrected by adjusting for the false discovery rate [131].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we evaluated whether our small sample of 6 individuals with DS (the only one for which we had linear measurements) was representative of the DS population by means of a t-test comparing the EV of these 6 subjects to the 30 subjects with DS reported by Aylward, Habbak [73].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images of virtual endocasts for six euploid females from Falk, Hildebolt [130], our six DS subjects, and LB1 were created and visually assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were performed with JMP Pro Statistical Software Release 11.0.0 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and MedCalc Statistics for Biomedical Research Version 15.2.1.0 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, because of the small sample size, power calculations were performed with Power and Precision Release 4.1 (Biostat, Inc., Englewood, NJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all comparisons listed in Table 2, the statistical power exceeds 99.9%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, for the largest P value (0.009 for cerebral width), the null hypothesis was that the mean cerebral width for the DS population is 124.95 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With alpha (the criterion for significance) set at 0.01, a two tailed test (which means that an effect in either direction is interpreted), and our sample size of 6 subjects with DS, the power exceeds 99.9%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This computation assumes that the population from which the sample was drawn has a mean of 124.95 mm with a standard deviation of 5.76 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed value was tested against a theoretical value (constant) of 103.40 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we used a one-tailed test in our tests for differences, we used a two-tailed test for our power calculation (which results in less statistical power) and used a conservative alpha level of 0.01, which results in broad confidence intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We quantified shape variation of the external neurocranium using a set of 39 3D landmarks (Table 5) acquired from dry skulls of geographically diverse adult euploid humans (n = 263) (see [132] for more details), surface renderings (from CT and MRI data) of humans with DS (n = 9), and LB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 9 individuals with DS, 7 were female and 2 were male.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One female was a juvenile (10 years of age) and one was a subadult (15 years of age), while the remainder of the sample ranged from 35 to 54 years of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Missing bilateral landmarks were estimated by mirroring its antimere (reflected relabeling) [133].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Landmark configurations were superimposed via generalized Procrustes analysis to remove the effects of scale, translation and rotation coded in the raw coordinate data [134, 135].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The x, y, and z coordinates of the 39 superimposed landmarks were then subjected to a principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data and assess the main patterns of neurocranial shape variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Operations were performed in SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and the PAST software package [136].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mandibular_symphysis_shape  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cross-sectional shape of the mandibular symphysis was quantified using elliptical Fourier analysis and analyzed using PCA as described in Brown and Maeda [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparative sample consisted of Australopithecus and Pleistocene Homo fossils, as well as one Paranthropus boisei fossil (KNM-ER 729) (Table 6), euploid humans from Melanesia, Edo Japan, Australia and Europe, six individuals with DS and the early Holocene Roonka 50 mandible discussed by Westaway, Durband [70] (see also [8]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symphyseal sagittal cross sections for individuals with DS were obtained from lateral CT localizer radiographs (scouts) associated with the Barnes-Jewish-Christian Hospital series discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six of the localizer radiographs were from individuals without remodeling of alveolar bone associated with the loss of mandibular incisor teeth (age range: 1567 y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five of the individuals were the same ones used in the analysis of endocasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous comparison of symphyseal cross-sectional shape outlines obtained from CT scan slices, lateral radiographs, sagittally sectioned mandibles and impression material did not indicate any significant differences in the resolution of shape and size [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We drew 68% confidence ellipses around each of the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stature_estimates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The original stature estimates provided by Brown, Sutikna [1] were 1.041.09 m, with an average of 1.06 m based on African pygmies, based on analyses using least squares regression (LS), major axis (MA) and reduced major axis (RMA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These equations are from Jungers [113], who calculated stature in the small-bodied australopith (A.L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2881, Lucy), and the same pygmy training sample was used subsequently to assess competing extrapolations to short stature by Konigsberg, Hens [112].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stature estimation for LB1 is revisited here in several different ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply the classic calibration equation from a large-bodied modern human reference sample that was validated and recommended by Konigsberg et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [112] using a femur length for LB1 of 280 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also bracket stature estimates by application of both inverse (ordinary least squares regression of stature on femur length) and classic calibration (regression of femur length on stature, solving for stature) using the reference sample of 19 African pygmies discussed above; we repeat this for femur length plus tibia length (515 mm in LB1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 216 mm, the tibia of a second adult tibia of H. floresiensis (LB8) is almost 2 cm shorter than that of LB1; if we use the crural index of LB1 (83.9) to estimate femur length for LB8, a value of just over 257 mm is obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we did for LB1, we predict stature for LB8 from the human pygmy training sample using the sum of femur and tibia lengths (473 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stature estimates for both LB1 and LB8 are compared with published data on stature in individuals with DS to address claims by Henneberg et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [25] that stature in the Liang Bua fossils is expected for modern humans with this pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These estimates are extrapolations because the lengths of LB1 tibia and particularly the femur are smaller than those recorded for small-bodied human populations from the Andaman Islands, Africa and the Philippines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, at 280 mm, the femur of LB1 is almost 4.7 standard deviations (sd) from the African pygmy mean (377 mm), 5.0 sd from the Negrito mean (378 mm), and 5.7 sd from the Andamanese mean (386 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Konigsberg, Hens [112] demonstrated that classic calibration works best in cases of when extrapolation is required to predict stature; this conclusion was reached empirically via validation on a pygmy test sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimates from classic calibration are therefore our preferred estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No modern human population could serve as a reasonable prior given the very small size of the Liang Bua limb bones, including small humans from Asia, but using a small-bodied population is preferable as it requires the least amount of extrapolation (see also [137]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The comparative data were drawn from growth charts for Turkish individuals with DS, chosen because they extended to age 18 and because they were among the shorter population for which data were available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, average statures for Turkish females (1.66 m) and males (1.76 m) were taller than local Javanese populations (1.50 m for females, 1.60 m for males; [138]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate rough estimates of the stature reduction associated with DS in the Javanese population, we applied an 11% (female) and 10% (male) decrease in height to the average euploid male and female statures based on the difference between the Turkish euploid and DS samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These estimates should be viewed with caution, however, as the Turkish data were reported as centiles rather than population averages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relative_femoral_length  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present summary data on the foot:femur ratio for LB1, as well as skeletal samples of modern humans of normal stature and short stature, from [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are unaware of skeletons of adults diagnosed with Down syndrome, but analogous anthropometric data are available for adults with Down syndrome and for euploid controls in Smith and Ulrich [115], the raw data of which was provided by the corresponding author (E. Smith); the ratio of their foot to thigh lengths approximates the foot:femur index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also present summary data in S3 Fig on the humerofemoral index based on adult osteological specimens for LB1, African Zulus, African pygmies, Andamanese, Asian Negritos and Khoe-San.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, lacking skeletons of individuals with DS, we must turn to anthropometrics of living individuals for comparison; the ratio of mean upper arm length to mean thigh length can be calculated from Smith and Ulrich [115] for both individuals with DS and controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data permit us to evaluate claims that individuals with DS converge on LB1 in relative femoral length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, the mean soft tissue ratios of the euploid controls were consistently higher (58.7) than both the skeletal and fleshy foot:femur (not thigh) length ratios for normal humans in Jungers et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7], which were 53 (skeletal) and 54 (fleshy) regardless of body size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soft tissue thigh length is apparently not precisely the same thing as skeletal femur length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To render the anthropometric and skeletal metrics commensurate, we therefore adjusted all soft tissue values downward by 5.6 points so that the euploid soft tissue mean ratio and mean skeletal ratios were equal at 0.53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A one-tailed t-test was used to evaluate the probability that the LB1 ratio was significantly higher than the DS sample average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phalangeal_length  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Henneberg, Eckhardt [25] argued that manual phalanges, particularly the distal phalanges, of LB1 were short relative to European standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also cited the short absolute foot length in LB1 relative to modern humans as evidence of short digits, and therefore support for the DS diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Short fingers (brachydactyly) and short broad hands are frequently cited as part of the DS phenotype, but no quantitative measurements are available, and it is unclear whether this should be assessed in absolute or relative terms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we could not confirm that short toes is a clinical sign of DS, we nevertheless evaluated whether the LB1 phalanges (manual and pedal) were absolutely and relatively shorter than those of normal- and small-statured populations of euploid modern humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that LB10 was originally described as a proximal pedal phalanx [32], but new fossils indicate that it is really a robust proximal pollical phalanx [139, 140].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most proximal, intermediate and distal pedal and manual phalanges of LB1 and LB6 cannot be assigned to specific rays and are therefore compared to data from multiple digits from females of African and European ancestry in the Hamann-Todd (Cleveland Museum of Natural History) and Terry Collection (National Museum of Natural History) (n = ~98).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A smaller and less complete data set of 22 individuals of mixed sex from small-bodied human populations from Asia (Musée de lHomme, Paris) and Africa (University of Geneva) was also utilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Summary statistics (mean, sd and range) are presented for both raw length measurements and relative length (scaled by femoral or humeral length as appropriate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As results are broadly comparable for the normal- and small-statured populations, only those of the latter are presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All phalangeal and associated long bone data were provided by Dr. Campbell Rolian, University of Calgary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
