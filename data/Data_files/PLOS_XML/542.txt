Ribosomal Stalk Protein Silencing Partially Corrects the F508-CFTR Functional Expression Defect  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most common cystic fibrosis (CF) causing mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508 or Phe508del), results in functional expression defect of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) at the apical plasma membrane (PM) of secretory epithelia, which is attributed to the degradation of the misfolded channel at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of phenylalanine 670 (F670) in the yeast oligomycin resistance 1 gene (YOR1, an ABC transporter) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae phenocopies the F508-CFTR folding and trafficking defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide phenotypic (phenomic) analysis of the Yor1-F670 biogenesis identified several modifier genes of mRNA processing and translation, which conferred oligomycin resistance to yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of orthologues of these candidate genes enhanced the F508-CFTR functional expression at the apical PM in human CF bronchial epithelia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although knockdown of RPL12, a component of the ribosomal stalk, attenuated the translational elongation rate, it increased the folding efficiency as well as the conformational stability of the F508-CFTR, manifesting in 3-fold augmented PM density and function of the mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combination of RPL12 knockdown with the corrector drug, VX-809 (lumacaftor) restored the mutant function to ~50% of the wild-type channel in primary CFTRF508/F508 human bronchial epithelia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results and the observation that silencing of other ribosomal stalk proteins partially rescue the loss-of-function phenotype of F508-CFTR suggest that the ribosomal stalk modulates the folding efficiency of the mutant and is a potential therapeutic target for correction of the F508-CFTR folding defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common autosomal recessive diseases in Caucasians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which functions as an anion channel at the apical plasma membrane of secretory epithelia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most common CF mutation, a deletion of the phenylalanine residue at position 508 (F508), results in the channel misfolding and subsequent intracellular degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous genome-wide phenotypic screens, using a yeast variant, have predicted modifier genes for F508-CFTR biogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that silencing of one of these candidate genes, RPL12, a component of the ribosomal stalk, increased the folding and stabilization of F508-CFTR, resulting in its increased plasma membrane expression and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that reducing the translational elongation rate via RPL12 silencing can partially reverse the F508-CFTR folding defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, RPL12 silencing in combination with the corrector drug VX-809 (lumacaftor), increased the mutant function to 50% of the wild-type CFTR channel, suggesting that the ribosomal stalk perturbation may represent a therapeutic target for rescuing the F508-CFTR biogenesis defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), is characterized by multiorgan pathology, mainly affecting the upper and lower airways, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine system [1,2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date ~2,000 mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene with widely variable disease severity [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene product, CFTR, is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, which functions as a cyclic AMP-regulated chloride and bicarbonate channel in secretory epithelia [2,6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of the phenylalanine at position 508 (Phe508del, designated as F508) in the nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1), the most common CF-causing mutation, results in misfolding and premature degradation of the mutant via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation pathway (ERAD) [79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small amount of F508-CFTR molecules that escape the ER are functionally, conformationally, and biochemically unstable and are rapidly removed from the plasma membrane (PM) via the endolysosomal associated degradation pathway [10,11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To rescue the folding defect of F508-CFTR, several strategies have been pursued with limited success so far [1214].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small molecule correctors that act as pharmacological chaperones, like VX-809, can directly bind to and promote the folding of F508-CFTR [1519].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination with the gating potentiator VX-770, VX-809 achieved only modest benefit in CF patients homozygous for the F508 mutation [20], which might be attributed in part to the destabilization of F508-CFTR upon chronic exposure to VX-770 [21,22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modifier genes may also facilitate the F508-CFTR functional rescue by enhancing the mRNA or protein expression, folding, stability, or by inhibiting its degradation at the ER and post-ER compartments [11,12, 2325].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Candidate modifier genes have been isolated by genome-wide SNP studies [26,27], identification of the CFTR interactome [2830], and phenotypic screens of targted siRNA libraries [11,31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a complementary approach, strategies focusing on reverting the maladaptive stress response in CF have been proposed [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of these approaches, however, appear to attain sufficient functional correction in preclinical studies to be therapeutically robust in patients with the most common CF mutation, particularly in individuals carrying only one copy of F508-CFTR, representing 40% of US CF patients [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chimeras between the yeast ABC transporter STE6 and F508-CFTR were used as a homology model to identify revertant mutations [33], but these chimeras are not recognized by the ER quality control [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we have employed a genome-wide screen to identify modifiers of CFTR misfolding, utilizing high-throughput yeast phenomic analysis of Yor1, a member of the ABC transporter superfamily, with deletion of phenylalanine 670 (Yor1-F670).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F508-equivalent mutation, Yor1-F670, results in protein misfolding, ER retention, and proteasomal degradation similar to that of F508-CFTR in mammalian cells [3537].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oligomycin, which inhibits the ATP synthase, is extruded by Yor1 across the PM, enabling a screen of the yeast gene deletion strain library [37,38] for modulators of Yor1-F670 processing as determined by oligomycin sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our phenomic screen provided a comprehensive gene interaction network that can potentially modulate F508-CFTR biogenesis [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolutionary conservation in the F-biogenesis network was demonstrated by the identification of many yeast homologs of published human genes that modulate F508-CFTR biogenesis similarly to that of Yor1-F670 function [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we validated a subset of genes that were identified by quantitative high throughput cell array phenotyping (Q-HTCP) in the yeast model, including components of the cytoplasmic exosome, rRNA biogenesis pathway, and most notably, the ribosomal stalk, in human respiratory cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that silencing of ribosomal stalk proteins, in particular RPL12, increases the rescued F508-CFTR PM density, function, and thermal stability, suggesting that ribosomal stalk proteins have a determinant role in the folding of the mutant channel and may represent a possible therapeutic target for correction of the F508-CFTR folding defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the results highlight the capacity of yeast phenomic screen as a systematic approach to investigate disease modifier genes, adding CF to a list of human diseases where yeast can function as a powerful model system [4042].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phenomic_Analysis_Reveals_Evolutionarily_Conserved_Gene_Interaction_Modules_That_Influence_Yor1-F670_Function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To select hits from our previous yeast screen [39] for further study in human cells, the top 180 gene deletions that increased oligomycin resistance of Yor1-F670-associated oligomycin sensitivity (or deletion suppressors) were prioritized by retesting and secondary screening with additional experimental controls (described below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hits were also subjected to analysis by the DAVID bioinformatics tool [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional annotation clustering identified two groups, ribosomal or ribosome-associated genes and genes involved in RNA degradation, with an enrichment score of  2 (S1A Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses revealed several gene interaction modules (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  multiple subunits of a protein complex) and, when analyzed in parallel with the yor1-0 (null) allele, verified that oligomycin resistance required interaction with Yor1-F670 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, Yor1-F670 interactions were confirmed by expressing the protein from a different promoter and without the C-terminal GFP fusion, that was used in our original screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double mutants were remade in quadruplicate using modified synthetic genetic array (SGA) methodology [44,45], and the new panel of double mutants was subjected to Q-HTCP to obtain growth curves at multiple oligomycin concentrations [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth curves were fit to a logistic growth function, and gene interaction was measured with respect to the cell proliferation parameter, L (Fig 1A), which corresponds to the time at which a culture reaches half of the carrying capacity [46].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple components of the cytoplasmic exosome (SKI2, SKI3, SKI7) (Figs 1C and S1B), genes involved in ribosomal RNA processing and the nuclear exosome (LRP1, RRP6, and RRP8) (Figs 1D and S1B), and ribosomal structural proteins (RPL12A, RPP2B, RPS7A, and RPL19A) (Figs 1B, 1E and S1B) were identified based on increased resistance to oligomycin upon the gene deletion, in the context of Yor1-F670, but not yor1-0 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On this basis, we focused on the cytoplasmic and nuclear exosome, ribosomal RNA biogenesis, and ribosomal proteins in order to test for the evolutionarily conserved influence of their knockdown on F508-CFTR biogenesis in mammalian cells (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Silencing_Human_Homologs_of_Yeast_Yor-1-F670_Biogenesis_Modifier_Genes_Similarly_Influences_PM_Expression_of_F508-CFTR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test for functional conservation among human homologs of S. cerevisiae genes found to regulate Yor1-F670 biogenesis, we used the human CF bronchial epithelial CFBE41o- (or CFBE) cell line with CFTRF508/F508 genetic background with no detectable CFTR protein expression as a model [47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CFBE cells were engineered to express inducible WT- and/or F508-CFTR-3HA as described [17,48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an indirect measure of biogenesis and/or peripheral stability of F508-CFTR, first the PM density of the mutant channel was determined by cell surface ELISA in polarized CFBE after siRNA-mediated knockdown of the putative target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two or three nonoverlapping siRNA sequences were used individually for each candidate gene to discriminate possible off-target effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SiRNA silencing of Yor1-F modifier homologs increased the PM density of the low-temperature (26°C) rescued F508-CFTR (rF508-CFTR) by up to ~3-fold, representing ~8% of the WT CFTR PM density, similar to the level achieved by the FDA-approved corrector, VX-809 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 50% increase in the PM density of rF508-CFTR for at least two siRNAs in comparison to nontargeted (NT) siRNA were considered as criteria for further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were met by siRNA-mediated silencing of SKIV2L (SKI2 in S. cerevisiae), TTC37 (SKI3), EXOSC10 (RRP6), RPL12 (RPL12A), POMP (UMP1), and TBC1D22B (GYP1) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the biochemical rescue of rF508-CFTR correlates with a gain-of-function phenotype, the PM conductance of CFBE cells was measured by the halide-sensitive YFP quenching assay in CFBE cells stably expressing the halide-sensitive YFP-H148Q/I152L/F46L, using a fluorescence plate reader [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The iodide influx-mediated YFP quenching was determined after maximal activation of the temperature rF508-CFTR with cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) agonists forskolin (Frk), 3-Isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX), and 8-(4-Chlorophenylthio)-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cpt-cAMP) in combination with the potentiator genistein (gen) (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of rF508-CFTR expression strongly increased the halide conductance of CFBE epithelia that was further augmented by knockdown of some of the Yor1-F modifier gene homologs (Figs 2B, 2C, S2A and S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of RPL12 or SKIV2L, by two independent siRNAs, increased the mutant channel PM function by 50%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notable, RPL12 knockdown induced ~270% transport activity of the NT control (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RPL12 knockdown, similar to VX-809, proportionally increased the PM density and function of rF508-CFTR (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, silencing of SKIV2L and most of the other genes tested, evoked a more substantial gain in PM density in comparison to function, suggesting the preferential escape of partially folded, poorly functional F508-CFTR molecules from the ER (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inference that RPL12 knockdown enhanced the rF508-CFTR conformational stability was supported by measuring the PM turnover of rF508-CFTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rF508-CFTR removal from the PM was ~5-fold faster (T1/2 ~2 h) in comparison to its WT counterpart (T1/2 of 10 h) after exposure to 37°C, which can be attributed to the channel unfolding, reflected by its increased protease susceptibility and ubiquitination that largely accounts for the accelerated internalization, lysosomal targeting, and attenuated recycling [11,49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPL12 knockdown considerably slowed down the rF508-CFTR biochemical and functional turnover at the PM (Fig 2E and Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jointly, these observations suggest that RPL12 deficiency promotes rF508-CFTR functional PM expression by facilitating the biogenesis and enhancing peripheral stability of the mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering that the modifier genes of the Yor1-F/F-CFTR processing defect can contribute to the regulation of translation, RNA processing, and vesicle transport, we tested the possibility that silencing of TBC1D22B, RPL12, EXOSC10, SKIV2L, POMP, or TTC37 genes can alter the cellular expression of native and conformationally defective membrane proteins in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ablation of these genes, however, did not increase the Ca2+-activitated TMEM16A Cl- channel activity, nor the transferrin receptor (TfR) or the conformationally defective, mutant megalencephalic leukoencphalopathy with subcoritical cyst 1 (MLC1-S280L) PM densities, as determined by the halide-sensitive YFP quenching assay [48], transferrin-HRP binding, or cell surface density measurement of MLC1-S280L, respectively (S2CS2E Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, silencing of these Yor1-F deletion suppressor proteins does not universally influence PM protein biogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SiRNA-Mediated_Knockdown_of_RPL12_Increases_the_Expression_of_Functional_F508-CFTR_at_the_Cell_Surface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the effects of RPL12 silencing at physiological temperature, the F508-CFTR function at the PM was studied in polarized CFBE monolayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both siRNAs decreased the RPL12 protein and mRNA expression by ~50% and ~40%, respectively (S3A and S3B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, the F508-CFTR PM density was increased by 2.55-fold relative to the NT siRNA treated cells (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F508-CFTR PM density was comparably augmented in nonpolarized HeLa cells, suggesting that the RPL12 knockdown effect is not CFBE-specific and independent of CFTR polarized expression (S3C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPL12 knockdown also enhanced the PM density of WT-CFTR in CFBE and HeLa cells (Figs 3A and S3C), probably by increasing the limited maturation efficiency of the WT channel [17,50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To distinguish whether RPL12 knockdown promotes the accumulation of the mature, complex-glycosylated (band C) F508-CFTR in post-ER compartments, or causes the channel redistribution from intracellular pools to the PM, the expression level of complex-glycosylated F508-CFTR was determined by immunoblot (IB) analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we were unable to visualize the complex-glycosylated form in the inducible CFBE expression system (Fig 3B), these experiments were also performed in CFBE cells constitutively expressing the channel at higher level, while preserving the hallmarks of F508-CFTR misprocessing (CFBEC) [51,52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, the RPL12 knockdown increased the abundance of the complex-glycosylated F508-CFTR (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, RPL12 knockdown led to the steady-state accumulation of the core-glycosylated F508-CFTR (band B) as well (Fig 3B and Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In accord with the increased PM expression, RPL12 silencing augmented the halide conductance (Fig 3D) and the Frk-stimulated short-circuit current (Isc) by up to 5-fold (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was further enhanced by addition of the potentiator gen in the constitutive F508-CFTR expressors (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, RPL12 knockdown had little effect on the function of WT-CFTR in CFBE (S3D Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RPL12_Knockdown_and_VX-809_Additively_Increase_the_Functional_Expression_of_F508-CFTR_in_Immortalized_and_Primary_Human_Bronchial_Epithelia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm the relevance of RPL12 silencing on the rescue of F508-CFTR misprocessing, we used primary human bronchial epithelia (HBE) isolated from five CF patients with CFTRF508/F508 genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CF-HBE were cultured on permeable filter supports at airliquid interface for 3 wk and transfected with either NT or RPL12_6 siRNA every 7 d, resulting in a decrease of Rpl12 protein expression by ~25% (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, RPL12 silencing was achieved by a single transfection with a double-stranded Dicer-substrate siRNA [53] (S4A Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chronic knockdown of RPL12 did not alter tight junction formation, the differentiation of globlet and ciliated cells and the development of transepithelial resistance of the monolayers (S4D Fig and S4E Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of RPL12 siRNA alone or in combination with VX-809 was determined on Frk plus gen-activated and inhibitor 172 (Inh172)-sensitive Isc of F508-CFTR in CFBE and CF-HBE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VX-809-mediated F508-CFTR correction was additive with RPL12 knockdown, increasing the maximal Isc to ~50% of WT-CFTR in CFBE (Figs 3E and S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, a large variation of the Isc was observed in CF-HBE cells from individual patients (Figs 4B, 4C, S4B and S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPL12 silencing enhanced the PKA-activated current by a mean 2.2-fold (range 1.13.1-fold) in the presence of the potentiator gen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to 35.7% of the WT-CFTR current, measured in HBE isolated from non-CF lungs (Figs 4C, S3E and S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VX-809 treatment alone increased the F508-CFTR current by 2.1-fold (range 1.62.7-fold), representing 27.7% of the WT-CFTR current as observed before [54] (Figs 4C, S3E and S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combination of RPL12 knockdown with VX-809 treatment augmented the Frk- and gen-stimulated Isc by 4.0 fold (range 3.14.9-fold), representing 54.4% of WT-CFTR in HBE cells (Figs 4C, S3E and S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RPL12 knockdown also increased the amount of complex-glycosylated F508-CFTR in HBE, similar to that in CFBE (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with VX-809 alone led to 2-fold enhanced expression of the complex-glycosylated form in both CFBE and CF-HBE cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rescue effect of VX-809 was at least doubled upon RPL12 silencing, indicated by ~6- and ~4-fold increase of the band C abundance of F508-CFTR in CFBE and HBE, respectively (Figs 3C and 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support the notion that distinct mechanisms are responsible for the RPL12 knockdown-mediated rescue and VX-809-dependent correction of the F508-CFTR functional expression defect in both CFBE and HBE cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RPL12_Knockdown_Increases_the_F508-CFTR_Folding_Efficiency_at_the_ER  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We postulated that RPL12 knockdown may enhance the conformational maturation efficiency of non-native F508-CFTR at the ER and/or stabilize the native-like conformation of the mutant, delaying its cell surface removal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low folding efficiency of the nascent F508-CFTR chains were measured by the conversion efficiency of the core-glycosylated F508-CFTR into complex-glycosylated form during an extended radioactive pulse labeling (3 h) and chase (2 h) at 37°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure the total [35S]-methionine and [35S]-cysteine incoporation during the pulse, while minimizing the degradation of core-glycosylated forms, the pulse duration was reduced to 30 and 20 min in parallel samples of CFBE and HeLa cells, respectively, (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPL12 knockdown increased the F508-CFTR ER folding efficiency from ~1.9% to ~3.2% in CFBE and from ~1.4 to ~4.4% in HeLa cells (Fig 5A and Fig 5B), while it decreased the radioactive labeling of the core-glycosylated F508-CFTR by 5080% both at 26°C and 37°C (Fig 5A5C) without reducing the CFTR transcript level (S5A Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained similar results by using a shorter pulse-labeling time (10 min) (S5C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combination of RPL12 knockdown with VX-809 additively increased the F508-CFTR maturation efficiency from 4.5% to ~7.5% relative to that in the presence of VX-809 alone, at 37°C (Fig 5D), consistent with nonoverlapping mechanisms of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Selectivity of the RPL12 knockdown effect was determined by measuring its impact on the cell surface density and turnover of a panel of PM proteins as surrogate readouts of their conformational stability [11,50,55,56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose mutations in the vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R-Y128S) [56,57], MLC1-P92S and -S280L [58], and the human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG-G601S) [55], which cause diabetes insipidus (V2R), megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy (MLC1), and long QT type 2 syndrome (hERG), respectively, due to conformational defects, misprocessing and accelerated PM turnover of the respective membrane proteins [5560].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Silencing of RPL12 had no significant effect on PM density and stability of the V2R-Y128S and MLC-P92S or -S280L in HeLa cells (Figs 6A, 6B, S6A and S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, knockdown of RPL12 increased the WT-hERG (~125% of NT) and hERG-G601S (140% of NT) PM densities (Fig 6C), without stabilizing the channels at the PM (S6C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect on steady-state PM density of WT and mutant hERG may be due to their inefficient conformational maturation, estimated to be ~40% and ~15% determined by metabolic pulse chase experiments [61] (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPL12 knockdown increased the hERG-G601S maturation efficiency from ~15% to ~25% (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Notably, incorporation of radioactive amino acids into newly synthesised hERG-G601S was decreased in RPL12 knockdown cells (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be attributed to translational inhibition rather than cotranslational degradation, since the amount of core-glycosylated hERG was increased after a 3 h chase at 37°C (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PM density of the TfR, a type I transmembrane protein [56], was only modestly decreased by RPL12 knockdown (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support the hypothesis that the RPL12 knockdown can preferentially influences the folding efficiency of metastable, multidomain membrane proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RPL12_Silencing_Enables_the_Biogenesis_of_Native-Like_F508-CFTR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compelling evidence indicates that synonymous mutations can influence the folding of polypeptide via defining the available time frame for the cotranslational folding and unfolding during translation in vivo and in vitro [6265].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If translational elongation slow down can shift the folding equilibrium of newly synthesized multidomain F508-CFTR towards the WT-CFTR conformer by kinetic or thermodynamic means, it is predicted that the thermostability of complex-glycosylated mutant would be increased as compared to the temperature rF508-CFTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The conformational stability of CFTR channels was measured by determining the thermal denaturation temperature, which induced 50% (T50%) conversion of detergent solubilised CFTR into SDS-resistant aggregates [66].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell lysates, obtained from rF508 or WT CFTR CFBE expressors were heat-denatured at 20°C80°C and the aggregation resistant, complex-glycosylated CFTR pool was quantified by immunoblotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPL12 knockdown increased the T50% of the complex-glycosylated rF508-CFTR from ~58°C to 67°C, a value that is close to the T50% of WT-CFTR (Fig 7A and Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that RPL12 silencing promotes the accumulation of conformationally more stable complex-glycosylated rF508-CFTR, conceivably by shifting the mutant folding energetic towards the WT, an inference substantiated by increased metabolic stability of the rF508-CFTR, determined by CHX chase and immunoblotting in HeLa cells (Fig 7C and Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPL12 silencing also delayed the rF508-CFTR biochemical and functional turnover at the PM in CFBE, as determined by cell surface ELISA and halide-sensitive YFP assays (Fig 7F and Fig 7G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surprisingly, RPL12 knockdown delayed the turnover of the immature F508-CFTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core-glycosylated form T1/2 was decreased from ~30 to ~50 min in HeLa and CFBE measured by CHX chase and immunoblotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Figs 7C, 7E and S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparable results were obtained by the metabolic pulse-chase technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 h chase ~14% of the initially labeled immature F508-CFTR remained in the RPL12 knockdown CFBE cells as compared to ~7% in the NT control at 37°C (Fig 7H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, impeded degradation of the core-glycosylated form may contribute to the enhanced ER maturation of F508-CFTR in CFBE cells (see also Fig 3B and 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, these observations suggest that the increased folding propensity of F508-CFTR in the presence of RPL12 down-regulation account for the increased PM density, function, biochemical, and functional stability, as well as reduced potentiator-dependent fractional activation of the Isc carried by F508-CFTR (S5C Fig and S5D Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Slow-Down_of_Translational_Elongation_Rate_by_Multiple_Means_Partially_Reverts_the_Folding_and_Processing_Defects_of_F508-CFTR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RPL12 knockdown causes translational elongation slow down in yeast [67,68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, the reduced pulse labeling of F508-CFTR and HERG-G601S suggested that RPL12 silencing may also impede the translational elongation rate in eukaryotes (Figs 5B, 5C, 6F and S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to insufficient radioactive signal incorporation into the F508-CFTR nascent chain in CFBE cells, we monitored the global kinetics of run-off elongation [69] in HeLa cells after RPL12 silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, translation initiation was inhibited with harringtonine [70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then run-off elongation was measured in the presence of [35S]-methinonine and [35S]-cysteine and terminated with cycloheximide (CHX) [71] after 13 min (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of radioactive nascent chains synthesis by phosphorimage analysis showed a considerable reduction in the global translational elongation rate in RPL12 knockdown cells (Fig 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, slowing down global translational elongation in Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cells by low concentration of CHX also induced the accumulation of the complex-glycosylated F508-CFTR and partial restoration of the PM chloride conductance [72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that pharmacological inhibition of translational elongation can partially rescue F508-CFTR processing in CFBE cells, we used low-concentrations CHX or emetine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both translational elongation inhibitors elicited a dose-dependent increase in the PM density of F508-CFTR, which correlated with the decreased expression of the core-glycosylated form as a consequence of partial translational inhibition (Fig 8C and Fig 8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirmed and extended previous observations [72], suggesting that the channel folding is favoured at a slower translational elongation rate regardless of whether it is achieved by pharmacological [72] or genetic means as shown by RPL12 ablation (Fig 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SiRNA-Mediated_Silencing_of_Ribosomal_Stalk_Proteins_or_the_Elongation_Factor_2_Increases_the_Functional_Expression_and_Stability_of_F508-CFTR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Deletion of the RPL12A and RPL12B genes in yeast leads to a defective assembly of the ribosomal stalk, disrupting the normal stoichiometry of P1 and P2 isoforms, which along with P0, and the 26S (28S in humans) rRNA, interact with Rpl12 to form the GTPase-associated center (GAC) [67,73,74].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stalk has been shown to participate in the translocation mechanism and to bind the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2), leading to the hypothesis that P-proteins act as GTPase-activators in conjunction with eEF-2 to increase the translational elongation rate [7477].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To support the notion that compromised integrity of the ribosomal stalk could increase the functional expression of F508-CFTR, the expression levels of P0 (RPLP0), P1 (RPLP1), P2 (RPLP2), and eEF-2 proteins were reduced by siRNA-mediated knockdown in CFBE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two or three siRNA sequences were used for each gene, reducing the mRNA expression by ~10%60% after 5 d in polarized CFBE (S7AS7D Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfection of these siRNAs increased the PM density and function of rF508-CFTR by up to 5-fold as compared to NT siRNA and indicated a good correlation between the knockdown efficiencies and the gain of PM density and function of the mutant (Figs 9A, 9B, S7F and S7G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, P0, P1, P2, and eEF2 knockdown conformationally stabilized the mutant, as indicated by the slower biochemical and functional PM turnover of the rF508-CFTR (Fig 9C and Fig 9D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering that reduced translational elongation rate following RPL12 knockdown is associated with the reduction of the ER load, and this may influence the protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network activity [23], we measured the expression level of molecular chaperones and cochaperones, critical determinants of the proteostasis network folding capacity [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression level of HSP90A, HSPA8, AHA1, STIP1, DNAJA1, and BAG1 however, remained unaltered upon RPL12 ablation (S8 Fig), suggesting that the ratio between the total pool of synthesized proteins and these chaperones and cochaperones was not affected by RPL12 knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an alternative method to test the influence of the ER load on cotranslational folding of F508-CFTR, we partially inhibited translation initiation by reducing one of the core translation initiation factors, the cap-binding protein eIF4E, expression using siRNA-mediated knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction of the eIF4E mRNA by ~50% (S7E Fig) decreased the pulse-labeled pool of F508-CFTR by ~30% (S7L Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led to a 20%30% increase in the rF508-CFTR PM density and function without altering its fast PM turnover or functional stability (S7HS7K Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are at variance with observation obtained in FRT cells upon inhibiting initiation with hippuristanol, which increased the F508-CFTR activity by ~2.5-fold at the PM [72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, significant reduction of protein synthesis, including F508-CFTR and the ER load by impeding translational initiation without translational elongation has a modest contribution to the conformational rescue of F508-CFTR, as compared to that of RPL12 silencing in CFBE and failed to provoke the accumulation of native-like, conformationally stabilized rF508-CFTR at the PM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While technology developments significantly improved the identification of the interactome of conformationally defective polypeptides, including the F508-CFTR [2830], establishing the functional significance of interacting proteins remains a daunting task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible approach is offered by global, quantitative analysis of functional gene interaction in yeast models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it is appreciated that the molecular processes involved in the translation, folding, maturation, and trafficking of integral membrane proteins are evolutionarily conserved [78], the extent to which global, quantitative analysis of gene interaction in a yeast model yields correct predictions of human genetic modifier that enhance the functional rescue of disease-causing target proteins, remains poorly understood [79,80].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we show that gene interaction studies using the yeast ATP-binding cassette family C (ABCC) protein Yor1 incorporating the F508-CFTR homologous mutation F670 can predict novel modifier genes of F508-CFTR biogenesis in respiratory epithelia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing six of the seven genes selected to probe various steps during Yor1-F670 biogenesis that acted as deletion suppressors to augment Yor1-F670-dependent oligomycin resistance [39], also increased PM expression of F508-CFTR in the human CFBE cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of RPL12, a component of the large ribosomal subunit stalk, increased both the ER folding efficiency as well as the metabolic and functional stability of the mature, complex-glycosylated F508-CFTR in post-ER compartments and at the PM, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results jointly indicate the conservation/concordance of gene interaction modules influencing the early biogenesis of Yor1-F670 and F508-CFTR, including mRNA turnover, rRNA processing, and ribosome structural assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to mammalian cells, the Rpl12 protein in S. cerevisiae is encoded by a duplicated gene, RPL12A and RPL12B, which are remnants of a genome duplication event [81].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of RPL12 and Yor1-F biogenesis, both RPL12A and RPL12B acted as deletion suppressors, but RPL12A knockout yielded a quantitatively greater effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of both genes is associated with a severe growth, but not a viability defect and results in a profound decrease in the translational elongation rate, while deletion of either single gene slightly retarded cell growth and elongation [67,68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Knockdown of Rpl12 protein expression by ~50% considerably decreased the global translational elongation rate as determined by the kinetics of run-off elongation in human CFBE cells (Fig 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concomitant increase of F508-CFTR PM density and function is reminiscent of a recent report by Meriin et al., demonstrating that pharmacological attenuation of translational initiation or elongation rate by hippuristanol or CHX, respectively, can partially rescue the PM functional expression defect of F508-CFTR in FRT cells [72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the cellular and molecular mechanism of F508-CFTR rescue is not known in FRT cells, here we show that RPL12 silencing increases the ER folding efficiency of the nascent chain and the stability of both the core- and complex-glycosylated forms, as well as the PM resident F508-CFTR channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced ER folding efficiency can be attributed, at least in part, to favourably changes in the folding energetics of the mutant, as reflected by the increased thermostability of the final fold, represented by the complex-glycosylated F508-CFTR in RPL12 ablated cells (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While we do not have a definitive explanation for the significantly increased co- and post-translational folding efficiency and stabilization of F508-CFTR upon translational elongation slow down, similar phenomena have been demonstrated for various polypeptides in silico, in vitro as well as in vivo [6265,82,83].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translational rate slow down may help to reduce the amount of misfolded domain intermediates that are resistant to conformational rescue by the proteostasis machinery, influence the stability of folding intermediates of the nascent chain and/or the folding trajectory of F508-CFTR by altering the binding to profolding and/or prodegradative constituents of the ribosome associated quality control machinery [8487].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The longer residence time of the nascent chain on the ribosome may also shield against degradation and facilitate folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hypothesis that reduced translation elongation increases F508-CFTR folding is consistent with earlier observations showing that slowing the global translational elongation rate by various interventions can improve the folding efficiency of specific proteins in eukaryotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synonymous codon changes that result in ribosomal pausing can lead to alternate folding pathways, distinct conformations, and can facilitate cotranslational targeting of membrane proteins to the translocon [63,65,88], as has been shown for the multidrug resistance 1 gene product P-glycoprotein [62,64].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, accelerating translation rate by synonymous codon substitutions in the -subdomain of WT-CFTR NBD1 resulted in aggregation of the full-length channel [89].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Codon optimization also resulted in conformational changes and impaired function of Neurospora, a clock protein [90].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The possibility that global translational attenuation by RPL12 knockdown can exert a general profolding effect is unlikely but cannot be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPL12 silencing did not shift the expression levels of known CFTR modifier genes such as HSP90A, HSPA8, AHA1, STIP1, DNAJA1, and BAG1, which are molecular chaperones and cochaperones that are known modulators of F508-CFTR folding and PM expression [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, whereas RPL12 siRNA increased the PM expression of hERG-G601S and F508-CFTR, and to some extent their WT-counterparts, RPL12 ablation had no effect on the PM density of V2R-Y128S, as well as MLC1-P92S or -S280L, despite the documented recognition of these misfolded membrane proteins by the ER and PM protein quality control systems [11,55,56,58,91].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, intrinsically slow and inefficient folding and domain assembly of the WT CFTR and hERG, which is further compromised by missense mutations, may sensitize these complex multidomain proteins to rescue upon translational elongation slow down.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rpl12 is localized in the 60S subunit GAC and interacts with the GTP-bound translation factors [9294].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rpl12 binds to the 28S rRNA together with ribosomal protein P0 to constitute the base of the lateral ribosomal stalk (P-stalk), which serves as a binding platform for ribosomal proteins P1 and P2 [67,73,74,95,96].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stalk is present in all eukaryotic ribosomes and plays an integral role in translation elongation, due to specific interactions of P1 and P2 with eukaryotic elongation factor 1 (eEF-1) and Rpl12 with eEF-2 [9294].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on evidence in yeast showing disruption of stalk components reduces translation without changing translational fidelity [68,75,76,97], we hypothesize that similar to the knockdown of RPL12, silencing of other ribosomal stalk proteins, which inhibits elongation factors recruitment and slows down the translational elongation, allows the development of a native-like F508-CFTR conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this hypothesis, silencing of P1, P2, P0, or eEF-2 increased the F508-CFTR functional expression and PM stability (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, silencing of one of the core translation initiation factors, the cap-binding protein eIF4E, decreased F508-CFTR synthesis but only slightly increased F508-CFTR PM density without stabilizing the rescued mutant channel biochemically or functionally at the PM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in FRT cells, however, showed that partial inhibition of translation initiation with hippuristanol leads to a substantial increased F508-CFTR function [72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the concomitant reduction of the overall ER protein load might be a contributing factor to the increased PM expression and function of F508-CFTR, but is likely insufficient to explain enhanced ER folding efficiency of the mutant channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results showing that knockdown of different ribosomal stalk proteins increases the folding propensity and function of F508-CFTR provide new insight into targeted slow-down of translational elongation as a possible therapeutic strategy for treating a conformational disease resulting from mutations in an evolutionarily conserved amino acid residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether other ribosomal proteins and ribosome-bound soluble factors are involved in this mechanism or small molecule inhibitors can be identified to mimic the genetic effect of RPL12 knockdown remain to be established in future work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From a translational perspective, our findings show that RPL12 knockdown is additive with the small-molecule corrector VX-809 in primary HBE cells with CFTRF508/F508 genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the treatment combination restores F508-CFTR function to ~50% of the WT level, a value that is deemed sufficient to alleviate CF clinical manifestations, since heterozygous carriers do not show disease symptoms [98].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of other ribosomal stalk proteins and the translational elongation factor eEF-2, similarly result in improved F508-CFTR biogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ribosomal stalk perturbation represents a potential target for rescuing the F508-CFTR biogenesis in combination with VX-809, which represents one the most efficacious strategies for the correction of F508-CFTR thus far [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work will clarify the mechanism by which the reduced translational elongation rate via reduced function of the ribosomal stalk could be used to treat ~90% of CF patients afflicted with this most common allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, application of yeast phenomics as part of an integrative research approach should be considered for its potential to discover genotype-phenotype networks that can guide discovery of new therapeutics for patients with CF and possibly other diseases that can be modeled in S. cerevisiae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Yeast_Strains_and_Media  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yeast deletion mutant strains were obtained from Research Genetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To retest selected hits, four single-colony deletion mutant clones were selected for construction of double mutants by the SGA, as described [44,45].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The query allele of the RL8 strain (described in [39]) was modified by substitution for the Tet promoter with the ACT1 promoter (Pact1) and without the C-terminal GFP tag to obtain the Pact1-yor1-F670-R1116T-HA allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To construct this allele, the pJ023 plasmid was modified by replacing the tetracycline promoter element with 680 bp of the 5 UTR of ACT1 promoter and then used to construct Pact1-yor1-F670-R1116T-HA (the R1116T second site mutation is described in [36]) by integrating it at the YOR1 promoter of LMY789, containing the yor1-F670-R1116T-HA allele (gift from Elizabeth Miller).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After SGA, frozen glycerol stocks were made for subsequent Q-HTCP analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YPEG media was made with 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 3% ethanol, and 3% glycerol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Q-HTCP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Q-HTCP was performed as previously described [46], assessing gene interaction by comparison of the cell proliferation parameter, L (the time (hours) after which half carrying capacity is reached), obtained from growth curves for single and double mutant cultures across a range of perturbation intensity using different growth-inhibitory concentrations of oligomycin, the primary substrate of Yor1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hundreds of replicates of the single mutant, Yor1-F670, were used to obtain the range of L at each condition tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interaction was calculated as the difference between the L values for the double mutant and the Yor1-F670 single mutant, after normalizing all data by the difference in L between the double mutant and the Yor1-F670 single mutant reference median in media not containing oligomycin, as previously described [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Culture_and_Media  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human lung tissues were obtained from CFTRWT/WT non-CF and CFTRF508/F508 CF individuals (patient code 21, 22, and 48) under the protocol and consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board at University of Alabama Birmingham (IRB #X080625002).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell isolation was performed as described [51,99].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After expansion, first or second passage cells were transferred to permeable filter supports and allowed to differentiate under airliquid interface conditions for 3 wk as described in [100,101].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, HBE cells (patient code BCFr43 and BCF121209) were purchased from the Cystic Fibrosis Translational Research center (CFTRc) at McGill University, expanded following the conditional reprogramming protocol described in [102] followed by differentiation on permeable filter supports under airliquid interface using the Vertex conditions [100].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The generation and maintenance of the CFBE cell lines, expressing WT- or F508-CFTR with a 3HA-tag in the 4th extracellular loop under the control of a tetracycline-inducible transactivator was described before [17,48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generation of stable CFBE cell lines constitutively expressing WT- or F508-CFTR has been described and these cell lines are depicted as CFBEC [51,52] to distinguish them from the inducible CFBE expression system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HeLa cells constitutively expressing extracellular 3HA-tagged WT- or F508-CFTR have been described previously [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SiRNA_Transfection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In CFBE cells, the target genes were silenced by forward transfection using 50 nM siRNA (Qiagen) and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfected cells were allowed to polarize for 5 d. For studies in filter grown CFBE cells, 100 nM siRNA duplexes were introduced by reverse transfection using an established protocol [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HeLa cells were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as described previously [11], and the experiments were performed 4 d after transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HBE cells were either reverse transfected with dsiRNA (Integrated DNA Technologies) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX [53] or were forward transfected for 6 h 1 d postseeding with 50 nM NT or RPL12_6 siRNA and the transfections were repeated every 7 d. Monolayers were cultured for a total of 21 d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PM_Density_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PM densities of extracellular HA-tagged proteins were determined by cell surface ELISA [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TfR PM density was measured by the specific binding of HRP-conjugated transferrin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative amount of transferrin-HRP or HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies was measured by luminescence, using a VICTOR Light plate reader (PerkinElmer) after addition of 50 l/well HRP-Substrate (SuperSignal West Pico, Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PM density measurements were normalized for cell number, determined by Alamar Blue assay (Invitrogen) or protein concentration, determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The halide-sensitive YFP quenching assay has been used before to determine the PM function of CFTR [19] or TMEM16A [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, F508-CFTR was activated by well-wise injection of 50 l/well activator solution (20 M Frk, 0.5 mM IBMX, 0.5 mM cpt-cAMP and 100 M gen in PBS) followed by 100 l PBS-iodide in which NaCl was replaced with NaI after a delay of 60 s. TMEM16A was activated by well-wise injection of 50 l/well 100 M ATP in PBS followed by 100 l PBS-iodide after a delay of 6 s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunoblotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For immunoblot analysis, cells were lysed either with NP-40-based lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) or RIPA (ThermoScientific) in the presence of Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (ThermoScientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following total protein quantification using the BCA assay (ThermoScientific), equal amounts of protein were mixed with 4X loading buffer, incubated at 37°C for 10 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto PVDF membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following antibody binding, signals were detected using the SuperSignal West Femto (ThermoScientific) or Luminata Crescendo (EMD Millipore) substrates and quantified on a ChemiDocXRS (Bio-Rad) or by densitometry using ImageJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thermoaggregation_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thermoaggregation assays were performed as previously described [66].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, following cell lysis with RIPA buffer, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation and the aggregation tendency of WT- and F508-CFTR was compared after exposing the lysates to 2080°C for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macromolecular aggregates were eliminated by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining soluble WT- and F508-CFTR, and HSPA4 in the supernatant was measured by quantitative immunoblotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isc_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CFBE or HBE cells expressing WT- or F508-CFTR were grown to confluence on permeable filters at an air-liquid interface and mounted in modified Ussing chambers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isc measurements were obtained under voltage clamp conditions using MC8 equipment and P2300 Ussing chambers (Physiologic Instruments) as previously described [51,52,103].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were equilibrated for 510 min in regular Ringer solution (115 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 2.4 mM KH2PO4, 1.24 mM K2HPO4, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM D-glucose, pH 7.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some measurements, this was followed by the exchange of low chloride Ringer (115 mM NaCl reduced to 1.2 mM NaCl and 10 mM D-glucose replaced with 115 mM Na-gluconate) to the apical surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After addition of the sodium channel inhibitor amiloride (100 M), the CFTR agonists Frk (10 M) and gen (50 M) were sequentially added, followed by inhibitor172 (10 M) at the conclusion of each experiment, in order to specifically inhibit CFTR activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in CFTR-mediated ion transport were calculated using the highest current value for each sample after achievement of a stable plateau for several minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metabolic_Pulse-Chase_Studies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experiments were performed essentially as described [104].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 45 d after NT or RPL12 siRNA transfection, CFBE (or HeLa) cells expressing F508-CFTR were pulse-labeled with 0.2 mCi/ml (or 0.1 mCi/ml for HeLa cells) 35S-methinonine and 35S-cysteine (EasyTag Express Protein Labeling Mix, PerkinElmer) in cysteine and methionine-free medium for 30 min for CFBE (or 20 min for HeLa) at 26°C or 37°C (incorporation efficiency) or labeled for 3 h at 26°C and then chased 2 h at 37°C in full medium (maturation efficiency).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radioactivity incorporated into the core- and complex-glycosylated glycoproteins was visualized by fluorography and quantified by phosphoimage analysis using a Typhoon imaging platform (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For depiction of representative images, autoradiographs were acquired by film-exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the experiments involving VX-809, NT, or RPL12, siRNA-transfected HeLa cells expressing F508-CFTR were treated with 3 M VX-809 or DMSO for 24 h before the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were pulse-labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml for 20 min and chased 2 h at 37°C in the presence or absence of VX-809.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maturation efficiency was determined by calculating the percent of pulse-labeled immature, core-glycosylated F508-CFTR conversion into the mature, complex-glycosylated form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To allow for the detection of the low percentage of complex-glycosylated F508-CFTR, the total labeling for 3 h was extrapolated from values obtained for 20 or 30 min pulse labeled samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ribosomal_Run-Off_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HeLa cell transfected with either NT or RPL12_6 siRNA were treated with harringtonine (2 g/ml) to stop translation initiation [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ongoing elongation was quantified by the metabolic pulse chase technique, using 35S-methinonine and 35S-cysteine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The run-off elongation was terminated after 13 min with CHX (100 g/ml).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and the total radioactive signal of fluorographs was measured by phosphoimage analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signals were normalized for the amount of protein loaded and expressed as percentage on non-CHX-treated controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Q-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Q-PCR was performed as described previously [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primers are listed in S2 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunostaining_and_Fluorescence_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Filter-grown differentiated HBE cells were washed with PBS containing 5 mM DL-dithiothreitol for 5 min on ice to remove mucin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For occludin staining, cells were pre-extracted with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min before fixation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After blocking in PBSCM (PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2) with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, washed with PBSCM, and stained with Alexa-Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000) or Acti-stain (1:300) for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclei were stained with DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cut-out pieces of filter were mounted on glass slides, and optical stacks were acquired using a laser confocal fluorescence microscope (LSM780 Carl Zeiss) equipped with a 63X/1.40 oil DICIII Plan apochromat objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically 2030 optical xy-sections were acquired and reconstituted using the Zen 2012 software, and representative xz-sections are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
