Brain network eigenmodes provide a robust and compact representation of the structural connectome in health and disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent research has demonstrated the use of the structural connectome as a powerful tool to characterize the network architecture of the brain and potentially generate biomarkers for neurologic and psychiatric disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the anatomic embedding of the edges of the cerebral graph have been postulated to elucidate the relative importance of white matter tracts to the overall network connectivity, explaining the varying effects of localized white matter pathology on cognition and behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate the use of a linear diffusion model to quantify the impact of these perturbations on brain connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the eigenmodes governing the dynamics of this model are strongly conserved between healthy subjects regardless of cortical and sub-cortical parcellations, but show significant, interpretable deviations in improperly developed brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, we investigated the effect of agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC), one of the most common brain malformations to identify differences in the effect of virtual corpus callosotomies and the neurodevelopmental disorder itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings, including the strong correspondence between regions of highest importance from graph eigenmodes of network diffusion and nexus regions of white matter from edge density imaging, show converging evidence toward understanding the relationship between white matter anatomy and the structural connectome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the structural connectome of the brain has emerged as a powerful tool towards understanding the progression of neurologic and psychiatric disorders, links between the anatomy of connections within the brain and the effects of localized white matter pathology on cognition are still an active area of investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we propose the use of the diffusion process towards understanding perturbations of brain connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that while the dynamics of this process are strongly conserved in healthy subjects, they display significant, interpretable deviations in agenesis of the corpus callosum, one of the most common brain malformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings, including the strong similarity between regions identified to be crucial towards diffusion and nexus regions of white matter from edge density imaging, show converging evidence towards understanding the relationship between white matter anatomy and the structural connectome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The brains anatomic connectivity network or the connectome is the substrate upon which most of the brains complex phenomena are enacted, and through which various brain disorders ramify.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has recently emerged that the brain network can be decomposed into its constituent eigenmodes, which play a specific and important role in both healthy brain function and pathophysiology of disease [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamics of any physical linear system can be described by a few constituent eigenmodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The celebrated Fourier basis is a well-known example, where sinusoids of varying wavelengths are mathematically described as the eigenfunctions of any bounded-energy linear time-invariant filter [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eigenfunctions are key features of classical mechanics, where for example, standing waves in continuous media are eigenfunctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In quantum mechanics, the probability cloud of the electrons orbit around the nucleus is described via eigenfunctions of the Schrodinger wave equation [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In structural biology, the so-called normal modes that describe the degrees of freedom of large molecules are the eigenfunctions of the equations that capture the relationship between the atoms of the molecule [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, many phenomena related to graphs or networks can be described in terms of the constituent graph eigenmodes, a field known as spectral graph theory [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this paper we use spectral graph theory to obtain and characterize the brains organization through its eigenmodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brain graph consists of nodes that represent anatomically defined gray matter regions, and edges whose weights are given by white matter fiber connections deduced from fiber tractography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the eigenmodes are predictors of brain phenomena by serving as mediators of networked spread processes within the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We had previously noted this role of the brain graphs Laplacian matrix [13] eigenmodes in the context of brain activity propagation [2], and neurodegenerative pathology ramification [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using network diffusion as the underlying model of spread, resting state BOLD functional connectivity (FC) was predicted in terms of structural network Laplacian eigenmodes [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small number of Laplacian eigenmodes reproduced FC, and the eigenspectra of Laplacian and of FC are intimately related [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other subsequent studies have explored the utility of the eigenmodes of the connectivity or adjacency matrix in capturing resting state functional networks [7, 8], in particular that a small number of such eigenmodes are sufficient to capture many elements of functional correlations in the brain [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current study attempts to quantitatively characterize anatomic graph Laplacian eigenmodes of the human brain in order to cement the emerging understanding that Laplacian eigenmodes play a fundamental role in governing the spatiotemporal patterning of brain phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigate to what extent a few low eigenmodes overlap between healthy subjects and between different scans of the same subject.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determine whether these eigenmodes are consistent across different atlas parcellations schemes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results on consistency and conservation are necessary to support the role of Laplacian eigenmodes as substrates of information and pathology transmission within the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next determine the influence specific white matter tracts exert on these eigenmodes, and show that these importance maps largely conform to previous maps [15, 16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we explore eigenmodes in neurological disease where we show that agenesis of the corpus callosum results in eigenmodes that largely resemble intact brains, but with lower eigenvalues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we expect that the second eigenmode would capture information diffusion between the hemispheres, and would therefore be especially affected by callosal dysconnectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the present study serves to formally characterize the brains eigenmodes in health and their behavior in disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Theory  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyze the brain connectome, determined via diffusion-tensor imaging and probabilistic tractography, through analyzing the eigenmodes of the connectomes network Laplacian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we investigate the neuroanatomical embedding of connections important to the Laplacian and how these constituent eigenmodes change in the case of agenesis of the corpus callosum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we describe the reliability of the slowest few eigenmodes of the network Laplacian, as well their neuroanatomical embedding in both gray and white matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare these results to other methodology used in understanding the embedding of the brain graph, and categorize the use of the Laplacian towards understanding agenesis of the corpus callosum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fig 7 (top) illustrates the first three eigenmodes of the control group and their corresponding eigenmodes in agenesis of corpus callosum (AgCC) and virtual callosotomy subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all three cases, the second eigenmode represents diffusion between both hemispheres, albeit more polarized in cases of AgCC and virtual callosotomies, likely due to the lack of an intact corpus callosum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of the gradual diffusion we see in healthy brains from one lateral side to medial areas of the brain and finally to the opposite lateral side, the bottleneck in left-right diffusion occurs solely at the corpus callosum in AgCC and virtual callosotomies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For higher eigenmodes, we see that each eigenmode in the control group is split into two eigenmodes in the AgCC or virtual callosotomy cases, each eigenmode representing the original control eigenmode across only a single hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fig 7 (bottom) shows the eigenvalue associated with the second eigenmode, left-right diffusion, normalized by the mean eigenvalue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that in cases of AgCC, the normalized second eigenvalue is statistically significantly (p less_than 0.05) higher in cases of AgCC than it is in virtual callosotomies, indicating a faster rate of diffusion between hemispheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that both AgCC and virtual callosotomies show lower normalized second eigenvalues than the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The brain network is a small world [33], has highly efficient communication capacity [34] and is highly modular, with some structures acting as hubs and some are critical for connecting different modules [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hub regions, in turn, preferentially connect to other hubs, forming a so-called rich club [28]that appears to anchor a structural core [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These properties come at some of the smallest wiring costs [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several graph metrics are available to characterize how mutual dynamic influences or perturbations can spread within the underlying structural brain network, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  communicability, defined as the number of paths between nodes weighted by the path length [37], and analytic measures like search information and path transitivity [34, 38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these graph theoretic metrics give a rich phenomenological and statistical description of brain networks, a parsimonious, low-dimensional descriptor is missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we presented evidence that the eigen-decomposition of the Laplacian provides a parsimonious basis and an important addition to existing graph theory metrics, a concept that naturally arises from linear models of network transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graph Laplacian is a discrete analog of the continuous Laplace operator 2, hence it naturally captures the process of graph diffusion [1, 2, 39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We had previously proposed that the brain graphs low eigenmodes act as network attractors for neurodegenerative pathologies [1], brain activity [2, 14] and the spread of hyperactivity in epilepsy [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these eigenmodes have the lowest eigenvalues, linear dynamics will settle into a few of these modes which are found to be highly consistent between subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a small number of constituent eigenmodes of the structural Laplacian were sufficient to reproduce BOLD-derived functional connectivity patterns [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We note that some of these theoretical results are by no means novel to the current paper or to our group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A vast body of related work exists in computer science and to a more limited extent in neuroscience as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationship between SC eigenvectors and FC was previously suggested in the local circuit context [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few anatomic Laplacian eigenmodes exhibited an uncanny resemblance to the spatial templates of BOLD resting state networks [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eigen-spectra of the Laplacian was found to be relatively conserved across various species [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a strong correspondence between Laplacian eigenmodes and the graph theoretic concept of modules; spectral graph theory relies on Laplacian eigenmodes to compute strongly connected node clusters, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  normalized cuts [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the spectral clustering algorithm of [42], when applied to the brain graph, yielded modules with a hierarchical base-2 tree architecture, where modules appeared to fall out from the eigenmodes of the graph [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the use of eigenmodes towards modeling wave propagation under neural field theory has been reviewed elsewhere [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The view of brain activity as a linear superposition of eigenmodes evokes Nunezs conception of global EEG rhythms as spatial eigenmodes [4446].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A full survey of this body of work is infeasible here due to limited space, and our key point is to showcase that Laplacian eigenmodes can have more widespread applicability in brain science than commonly thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of course, many brain phenomena can be accessed only using non-linear models, for instance cascading behavior resulting from cooperative and competitive dynamics [47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, some of these models, such as neural field theory, take advantage of the same operators, namely the network Laplacian, making the study of these operators highly relevant [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While local brain dynamics are not linear or stationary, the emergent stationary behavior of long-range interactions can be independent of detailed local dynamics [34], and ensemble-averaged behavior of large connected but individually nonlinear neural populations can be quite linear [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Low_Laplacian_eigenmodes_appear_to_be_conserved_between_individuals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First we showed that the network Laplacian possesses largely conserved eigenspectra (Fig 4) between subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eigenvalues associated with the eigenmodes, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the eigenspectrum, provide a natural ordering of the eigenvectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As argued previously, the reciprocal eigenvalues  represent characteristic time constants of diffusive processes within each eigenmode i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence the long-term patterns of any linear process of spread, whether of activity or pathology, will essentially settle into the eigenmodes with the lowest eigenvalues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that these first few eigenmodes of a subject are not overly sensitive to atlas parcellation and connectome extraction techniques (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the lowest eigenmodes are reasonably stable, reproducible and consistent within and amongst subjects (Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results serve to confirm that spectral graph theory of brain processes will likewise be generalizable within, between and across healthy subjects, suggesting that low eigenmodes might represent some invariant properties of brain networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why should graph eigenmodes in one persons network be similar to anothers at all?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, healthy subjects show canonical connectivity patterns at the macroscopic level despite significant variability in specific tracts and regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps as a consequence, they are able to sustain highly repeatable functional connectivity patterns, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the default mode network [49].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we were able to rule out the effect of spatial cost-wiring rules through the use of geometrically-null random networks, there are still many conserved properties of brain networks, such as small-world and rich club properties, that can contribute to this consistency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, low eigenmodes may be conserved between individual brain networks, and only higher eigenmodes might be responsible for inter-subject variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not unlike the low frequency harmonics displayed by many simple physical systems of diverse origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be interesting to explore in more detail the topological factors that are driving the invariance in the brains low eigenmodes, and to test whether certain wiring rules also produce these invariants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a subject of future work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relationship_to_hubs_and_critical_networks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies on the the effect of lesions on the brain connectome largely focus on the node level, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gray matter regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, rich club nodes have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, and Alzheimers disease [28, 50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used eigenmodes to explore edge-level effects of lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While other approaches have identified white matter areas of high importance by examining the effects of simulated lesions on network performance measures such as efficiency or characteristic path length [51], these maps often denote lateralized focal peripheries as the areas of highest importance and show little overlap with the rich club connections from [28] and [15, 16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that eigenmodes provide an alternative approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By separating overall transmission within the brain into its slowest, individual rate limiting eigenvectors, we can assess which white matter voxels and edges are most important to them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we find that importance maps for the second and fourth eigenmodes showed similarities to edge density maps of rich club and feeder connections, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [28], while the third eigenmode is similar to local connections (those between non-rich club nodes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These similarities are robust under changes to how the lesion is defined, indicating they are latent properties of the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, we find heavy weighting within posterior periventricular white matter, mirroring the observations in [15, 16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These similarities are interesting because rich club and Laplacian eigenmodes were historically defined in completely different contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While rich club nodes are associated with high degree by definition, it is not immediately apparent that the slowest diffusion processes would rely on this subnetwork disproportionately when compared to the third, faster, eigenmode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possibly, faster diffusion processes rely on a broader range of connections, both rich and non-rich, when compared to the second eigenmode, and these redundancies de-emphasize rich club edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, the convergence of the eigenmode- and edge density-derived importance maps from [15, 16] is a promising indicator of the relationship between white matter anatomy and the structural connectome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Eigenmodes_of_impaired_brains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that healthy brain eigenmodes appear largely conserved between and within subjects, next we explored how they might change in impaired brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intuitive way to investigate the influence of the corpus callosum, the largest inter-hemispheric fiber bundle, is through the study of individuals who are born without it, a condition known as agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) [52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, these individuals often outperform patients with a corpus callosotomy on various motor control tasks that required inter-hemispheric communication [53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Past studies on AgCC have focused largely on analysis of resting state fMRI networks [54, 55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many studies note that AgCC subjects tend to perform closer to healthy subjects compared to patients who underwent corpus callosotomies and ascribe this difference on replacement tracts that are only present in AgCC cases, presumbably via adaptation [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we were able to provide a quantitative intuition to the effect these structural adaptations have on inter-hemispheric communication through the network Laplacian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we found statistically significant differences between the eigenspectra of AgCC and virtual callosotomy brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we validated the intuition that the low healthy eigenmodes might split into separate eigenmodes in cases of virtual callosotomies and AgCC, due to lack of inter-hemispheric connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many theoretical results exist on the eigenspectra of disjoint graphs [13], which predict exactly this behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results taken together serve to quantitatively characterize the anatomic graph Laplacian eigenmodes of the human brain in order to cement the emerging understanding that Laplacian eigenmodes play a fundamental role in governing the spatiotemporal patterning of brain phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that these eigenmodes are consistent and robust across different atlas parcellations schemes, and also determine the influence specific white matter tracts exert on these eigenmodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we explore eigenmodes in neurological disease where we show that agenesis of the corpus callosum results in eigenmodes that largely resemble intact brains, but with lower eigenvalues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we expect that the second eigenmode would capture information diffusion between the hemispheres, and would therefore be especially affected by callosal dysconnectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the present study serves to formally characterize the brains eigenmodes in health and their behavior in disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
