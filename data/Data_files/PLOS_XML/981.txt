Languages Are Still a Major Barrier to Global Science  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While it is recognized that language can pose a barrier to the transfer of scientific knowledge, the convergence on English as the global language of science may suggest that this problem has been resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our survey searching Google Scholar in 16 languages revealed that 35.6% of 75,513 scientific documents on biodiversity conservation published in 2014 were not in English.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ignoring such non-English knowledge can cause biases in our understanding of study systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as publication in English has become prevalent, scientific knowledge is often unavailable in local languages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hinders its use by field practitioners and policy makers for local environmental issues; 54% of protected area directors in Spain identified languages as a barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We urge scientific communities to make a more concerted effort to tackle this problem and propose potential approaches both for compiling non-English scientific knowledge effectively and for enhancing the multilingualization of new and existing knowledge available only in English for the users of such knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
