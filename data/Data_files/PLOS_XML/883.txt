Drivers of Inter-individual Variation in Dengue Viral Load Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dengue is a vector-borne viral disease of humans that endemically circulates in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection with dengue can result in a range of disease outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A considerable amount of research has sought to improve our understanding of this variation in disease outcomes and to identify predictors of severe disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contributing to this research, patterns of viral load in dengue infected patients have been quantified, with analyses indicating that peak viral load levels, rates of viral load decline, and time to peak viremia are useful predictors of severe disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we take a complementary approach to understanding patterns of clinical manifestation and inter-individual variation in viral load dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we statistically fit mathematical within-host models of dengue to individual-level viral load data to test virological and immunological hypotheses explaining inter-individual variation in dengue viral load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We choose between alternative models using model selection criteria to determine which hypotheses are best supported by the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first show that the cellular immune response plays an important role in regulating viral load in secondary dengue infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then provide statistical support for the process of antibody-dependent enhancement (but not original antigenic sin) in the development of severe disease in secondary dengue infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show statistical support for serotype-specific differences in viral infectivity rates, with infectivity rates of dengue serotypes 2 and 3 exceeding those of serotype 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results contribute to our understanding of dengue viral load patterns and their relationship to the development of severe dengue disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They further have implications for understanding how dengue transmissibility may depend on the immune status of infected individuals and the identity of the infecting serotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dengue is an important vector-borne disease that infects four-hundred million individuals annually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection results in a wide range of clinical symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though many risk factors of dengue are known, the mechanisms explaining why an individual will suffer severe symptoms are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical studies have shown characteristics of viral load kinetics of dengue-infected individuals may be indicators of disease severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, viral load measurements vary considerably by individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use statistical methods to empirically test hypotheses that may explain variation in dengue viral load patterns by clinical manifestation and by serotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that there is statistical support for antibodies being responsible for higher disease severity during secondary dengue infections and for high viral infectivity rates of dengue serotypes 2 and 3 relative to dengue 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results further understanding of the relationship between viral load patterns and severe dengue disease and have important implications for dengue transmissibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dengue is an important arthropod-borne virus whose incidence and spatial extent have increased dramatically in recent years [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The virus comprises 4 serotypes (DENV-1-4), each of which is further structured into clades of genetically similar viruses called genotypes [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection by any one of the four serotypes can result in a range of severity from asymptomatic infection to symptomatic dengue fever (DF) to potentially fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current understanding of why some dengue-infected individuals develop severe disease while others do not manifest the infection clinically is still limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to the complex relationship between the dengue virus and the immune response [3, 4], the presence of antigenic cross-reactivity between serotypes [3, 5], phenotypic variation between dengue genotypes [6, 7], and the lack of a suitable animal model [8, 9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite limitations in our current understanding of dengue pathogenesis, key risk factors for the development of severe dengue disease have been identified in longitudinal epidemiological studies [1013].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies have shown that the most important risk factor for severe disease manifestation is a secondary heterologous dengue infection [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical and experimental studies have indicated that increased disease severity during secondary infection may be explained by poorly-neutralizing antibody responses and suboptimal cross-reactive T-cell responses against the infecting serotype [3, 1416].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Longitudinal epidemiological studies have further indicated that the identity of the infecting serotype can impact the risk of developing severe dengue disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a study in Nicaragua indicated that primary DENV-1 infections were associated with more severe clinical manifestations than primary DENV-2 infections [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A study in Thailand showed that DENV-2 was associated with more severe disease than DENV-1, after controlling for exposure history [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this same study, secondary DENV-2 and DENV-3 infections were also twice as likely to result in DHF than secondary DENV-4 infections [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is further evidence indicating that dengue genotypes can differ in virulence [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Asian genotype of DENV-2 appears to cause severe disease more frequently than the American genotype of DENV-2 [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very little is currently known, however, about why certain dengue serotypes and genotypes may be associated with increased disease severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most well-studied mechanism invoked to explain observed differences in virulence involves differences in viral replication rates between dengue viruses [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro studies have shown that the Asian I genotype of DENV-2 appears to have a higher replication rate than the American genotype of this serotype [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies have shown that dengue serotypes can differ in their ability to subvert type I interferon signaling [21] and in patterns of CD8+ T cell immunodominance [22], both of which may impact patterns of clinical manifestation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better understand the mechanisms underlying these important risk factors for the development of severe disease, viral load patterns of dengue-infected patients have become increasingly characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High viral loads are generally associated with severe dengue disease [2325], and have been suggested to be necessary for the development of plasma leakage, a hallmark of DHF [15, 25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet the relationship between high viral load and increased disease severity becomes inherently more complex when further stratified by clinical manifestation (DF or DHF) and by serotype [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Vietnam, for example, where DENV-1 incidence is typically high relative to other serotypes, DENV-1-infected individuals generally appear to have higher viral loads than DENV-2-infected individuals, but DENV-2 infections are typically associated with higher disease severity [23, 26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from viral load levels, the rate of viral clearance and the time to peak viremia have been used as predictors for the development of severe dengue disease [23, 2527].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, our aim is to improve our understanding of the within-host mechanisms leading to observed variation in viral load dynamics across dengue-infected patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insight into these mechanisms can shed light on why certain viral load features may be useful for predicting dengue disease outcome and on the mechanistic basis behind identified risk factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach is statistical in nature: we fit mechanistic within-host dengue models to viral load measurements from infected patients and use a Bayesian approach to choose between the models to identify significant drivers of viral load variation between patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bayesian methods have become an increasingly popular approach for parameter inference [28], in part because they allow for incorporation of prior information of parameters and for a straightforward analysis of correlation structure between parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has been used for inference of within-host HIV models [29, 30], as well as, more recently, dengue models [31, 32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In [31], parameters of a simple dengue within-host model were fit to viral load measurements from exclusively DENV-1 infected patients of the same clinical cohort we study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors considered model variants in which some parameters differed by individual while others differed only by group (defined by immune status and clinical manifestation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They found that individual variation in intrinsic incubation period and immune response parameters were needed to account for observed inter-individual variation in DENV-1 virus dynamics [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They further found that the parameters controlling viral infectivity and viral clearance were higher in secondary infections than in primary dengue infections [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an extension of this model fit to both DENV-1 and DENV-2 viral load data along with antibody measurements [32], the authors showed that antibodies are important in controlling viral replication by two possible mechanisms: (1) antibody killing of infected cells via antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or (2) antibody neutralization and clearance of virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in [31], some parameters were fit individually while others were allowed to vary by serotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To complement this work, we here consider the viral load dynamics across dengue serotypes DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3, while still taking into account that variation in viral load might arise from differences in the immune status, clinical manifestation, and/or infecting serotype of patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we consider models of increasing complexity that reflect hypotheses that have been put forward in the dengue literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first consider a model in which all observed individual viral load measurements follow the same within-host dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We build on this model by allowing within-host dynamics of secondary heterologous infections to differ from those of primary infections in their ability to rapidly invoke a cellular immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following these models, we consider processes that have been invoked to explain differences in clinical manifestation outcomes: original antigenic sin (OAS) of T-cells and antibody dependent enhancement (ADE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we consider models that capture serotype-specific differences in viral infectivity rate, the strength of the elicited innate immune response, and the strength of the elicited T-cell response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of model fits using both the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) first indicate that variation in viral load is in part explained by individual immune status (primary or secondary infection), with ADE contributing to whether a patient develops DHF in a secondary dengue infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation in viral load is further explained by the identity of the infecting serotype, with the best supported hypothesis having serotypes differ in viral infectivity rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, our analysis shows that viral infectivity rates of DENV-2 and DENV-3 are significantly higher than those of DENV-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Discussion, we consider the implications of these results for understanding patterns of dengue disease severity and transmissibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We statistically analyze individual-level dengue viral load data from a clinical trial of the antiviral drug chloroquine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trial enrolled adult dengue patients at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam [23, 33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous analyses of the viral load data indicate that chloroquine had no measurable effect on viral load dynamics [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A reanalysis of the effect of chloroquine on viral load dynamics in the context of the models fit here confirms this conclusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide more details on this in the Results section.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore do not make a distinction between chloroquine-treated patients and control patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viremia of 239 dengue-infected patients was measured in the blood twice a day following hospitalization, which was within 72 hours of reported symptom onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus was quantified by RT-PCR and the assay used had a limit of detection of either 1,500 copies/ml or 15,000 copies/ml [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time was measured in days since the onset of symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to viremia measurements, the dataset included each patients infecting serotype, immune status (primary infection or secondary infection), and clinical manifestation (DF or DHF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients were infected with either DENV-1 (N = 142), DENV-2 (N = 51), DENV-3 (N = 39), or DENV-4 (N = 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30 of the patients were experiencing a primary infection; the remaining 209 patients were experiencing a secondary infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, 170 patients presented with DF; the remaining 69 presented with DHF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the low numbers of primary infection DHF patients (N = 4) and of DENV-4-infected patients, we excluded these individuals from our analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 shows the raw viral load data from the remaining 228 patients, stratified by infecting dengue serotype (DENV-1, DENV-2, or DENV-3) and by immune status and clinical manifestation (primary infection DF, secondary infection DF, or secondary infection DHF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Within-host_dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We consider dengue within-host dynamics to be governed by the following set of equations:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(1)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where X is the number of uninfected cells, Y is the number of infected cells, V is the concentration of free virus, N is the number of natural killer (NK) cells, and T is the number of T-cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free virus infects target cells at rate , NK cells clear infected cells at rate , T-cells clear infected cells at rate T, infected cells produce free virus at rate , free virus is cleared at rate , infected cells stimulate the production of NK cells at rate q, NK cells decay at rate dN, the interaction of T-cells and infected cells stimulate the production of T-cells at rate qT, and T-cells decay at rate dT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These equations are based on a previously published within-host mathematical model for dengue that is capable of reproducing characteristic features of both primary and secondary dengue infections [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In both primary and secondary infections, the innate immune response (represented by NK cells) plays a pivotal role in regulating viral dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption is based on empirical studies that have shown support for the innate immune response (over the adaptive immune response) in clearing primary dengue infections [35, 36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The innate immune response has further been shown to remain important for regulating viral dynamics in secondary infections [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In secondary infections, we assume that T-cells can contribute to the clearance of dengue-infected cells, based on a study that showed that T-cells were required for protection against heterotypic dengue infection in a mouse model [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In primary infections, we assume (based on [36, 38]) that T-cells contribute negligibly to viral load dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We implement this assumption by setting the initial number of T-cells (T0) to zero in primary infection model fits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that eq (1) do not model antibody dynamics explicitly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the magnitude of the viral infectivity rate  can implicitly incorporate the role of antibodies in enhancing viral infectivity in certain subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eq (1) differ from the within-host dengue equations used in [31, 32], in which the authors assume clearance of infected cells or clearance of free virus by an adaptive immune response in both primary and secondary infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Eq (1) contain a total of 5 initial conditions (X0, Y0, V0, N0, and T0) and 9 model parameters (, , T, , , q, dN, qT, and dT) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first perform an identifiability analysis on eq (1), similar to the approach used by Clapham and colleagues [31], to determine which of these initial conditions and parameters could in principle be independently estimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substituting V = V, N = N and T = T T into eq (1) yields:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

These equations show that parameters q and  and parameters  and  cannot be independently estimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to a lack of knowledge of the value of either q and , we assigned  an arbitrary value of 103 per day for all analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further assign  a value of 104 copies/cell/day based on a virological study (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assign values to initial conditions and parameters that have been independently derived in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trivially, we set the initial number of infected target cells (Y0) and NK cells (N0) both to 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following [31], we set the initial number of uninfected target cells (X0) to 107 cells/ml (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is reasonable, given the range of healthy monocyte densities in plasma of adults [35, 39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further set death rates of NK and T-cells (dN and dT, respectively) based on literature estimates (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identifiability analysis further shows that without T-cell data we cannot estimate T0 and T independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore first set T0 to a value of 105 cells/mL, a reasonable value based on immunological studies (Table 1) and attempted to fit T. However, due to lack of T-cell data and early viral load data, the parameter T became practically unidentifiable (see Results section below), covarying almost perfectly with the parameter qT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus set T to 106 per day such that T-cell counts would reach maximum values on the order of 106 cells/ml, consistent with values from studies examining T-cell dynamics in dengue infections [40, 41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The only initial condition we therefore fit in our statistical analysis of the viral load data was the initial amount of free virus V0, which we estimate on the log-transformed scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters in eq 1 we fit were , , q, and qT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the viral load data were reported as a function of time since the onset of symptoms and eq (1) describe within-host dengue dynamics from the start of infection, it was necessary to further estimate the incubation period (IP), defined as the time between viral inoculation and the onset of symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since IP correlates strongly with the initial amount of free virus (V0), we do not attempt to estimate IP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we rely on results from a study that used Bayesian time-to-event models to estimate IP durations using observations from 35 empirical dengue studies [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study estimated an IP of 5.9 days for dengue, with 95% of the estimates lying between 3 and 10 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of the viral load data shown in Fig 1 suggests that much of the inter-individual variability of the data may be explained by individual differences in IP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore include a random effect on the IP to account for this variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To incorporate this random effect, we assume that individual incubation periods are log-normally distributed based on the results in [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set the mean value of the log-normal distribution to log(IPg) where IPg is 5.9 days [42] and estimate the standard deviation of the incubation period, I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bayesian_implementation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To fit eq (1) to the viral load data shown in Fig 1, we assume log10 viremia measurements have normally-distributed measurement errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given an incubation period IPj for individual j, the likelihood of the model parameters  given this individuals viral load data Dj is given by:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(2)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The likelihood is evaluated over the number of viral load data points n of individual j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A given viral load data point k is provided at time tk, measured in days since the onset of symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dj(tk) is thus the viremia measurement from individual j at tk days since the onset of symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for the incubation period, the model-predicted viremia measurements M are measured at times tk + IPj.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Dj and M viremia levels are on the log10 scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is the Gaussian probability density function (pdf), where the parameter quantifying the standard deviation of the measurement error is , which, as in [31, 32], we set to 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the Gaussian pdf to calculate the probability of observing Dj(tk) only if the data point Dj(tk) lies above the limit of detection (LOD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is the Gaussian cumulative distribution function (cdf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the Gaussian cdf to calculate the probability of observing a data point Dj(tk) at or below the LOD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than sample the IPjs individually, we integrate them out numerically, assuming the probability density of IPj is given by .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall log-likelihood is then the sum of log-likelihoods over all individuals for whom we have viral load data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full log-likelihood expression is provided in the S1 Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for MCMC parameter estimation with a multivariate normal proposal distribution truncated to the positive quadrant as the model parameters shown in Table 1 are restricted to be positive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because values of V0 are close to 0 but cannot be 0, instead of estimating V0 directly we estimate log10(V0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use uniform improper priors for all estimated parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MCMC algorithm was run for a total of 300,000 iterations, with a burn-in of 150,000 iterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each model we considered was run for 4 different sets of initial conditions of all parameters estimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed model convergence by calculating the Rubin-Gelman convergence diagnostic for each model and ensuring that  for each parameter [47], as well as assessing posterior trace plots for convergence by eye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all models, we found  to be less_than 1.1 for all parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To incorporate parameter correlations, after 30,000 iterations, we began adapting the covariance of the proposal to the model posterior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 150,000 iterations, we fixed the covariance matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In some of the figures shown in the Results section, we plot estimates of individual incubation periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since for each individual j we marginalize over the individual incubation periods during the process of parameter estimation (see above and the full likelihood expression provided in the supplemental material), our plotting of individual incubation periods is simply to show the most likely incubation periods for individuals of a certain group relative to individuals of other groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Draws from the joint posterior are obtained by sampling from the conditional distributions of the incubation periods given sampled parameters , proportional to p(IPj|logN(log(IPg), I))Lj(|Dj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Models_considered  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimate parameters of eq (1) for models of varying complexity that reflect hypotheses that have been put forward by virological and immunological studies of dengue infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our goal in fitting these various models is to determine which hypotheses best explain variation in viral load patterns observed in dengue infected patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 2 summarizes the set of models we consider.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first model we fit (model 0) is the most basic dengue model: it assumes that viral load dynamics are regulated by the innate immune response, and that the adaptive immune response plays a negligible role in regulating viral dynamics in both primary and secondary dengue infections (T0 = 0, qT is not estimated).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It further assumes that viral load dynamics do not differ by the infecting serotype or by disease manifestation (DF/DHF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this model we fit four parameters (, , q, I) and one initial condition V0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second model we fit (model 1) assumes that T-cells are important in clearing infected cells during secondary infections, but not in primary infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We implement this model by fitting the primary infection data to eq (1) under the assumption that T0 = 0, and by fitting the secondary infection data to eq (1) under the assumption that T0 = 105 cells/ml.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under this model, we assume that all other parameters and initial conditions listed in Table 1 are the same across infection types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this model we therefore fit five parameters (, , q, qT, I) and one initial condition V0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We select between models of increasing complexity by using two criteria for model selection: the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [54] and the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) [55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BIC is a function of the highest posterior log-likelihood and explicitly penalizes more complex models with higher number of parameters more strongly than other model selection criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is calculated as: BIC = 2ln(L) + kln(n), where ln(L) is the highest log-likelihood of the model samples, k is the number of free model parameters to be estimated, and n is the total number of viral load measurements (n = 2415 data points).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A difference in BIC between two models of 26 is considered positive, 610 strong and  10 very strong support in favor of the model with lower BIC [54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DIC is a model criterion typically used for Bayesian hierarchical models and is frequently used for model selection in MCMC analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though DIC does not penalize complex models with more parameters explicitly, it is considered a Bayesian analogue of AIC [55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DIC is defined as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance of the posterior mean of the parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mathematically this is described as: , where bar denotes expectation with respect to the posterior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In more complex models the deviance of the posterior means of the parameters is expected to be higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A difference in DIC of 12 values is considered positive, whereas a difference  3 is considered strong support for the model with lower DIC [55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To first determine whether the viral load data provide statistical support for the role of T-cells in clearing infected target cells in secondary dengue infections, we compare the results of fitting models 0 and 1 to the data (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median log-likelihood for model 1 is significantly higher than that of model 0, indicating that the inclusion of T-cell dynamics in secondary infections significantly improves model fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BIC and DIC values of these models indicate that model 1 is preferred over model 0, despite its higher level of model complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traces of model 1s MCMC runs with different initial conditions are shown in S1 Fig, visually indicating convergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation structure of model 1 marginal posteriors are shown in S2 Fig Median likelihood estimates and 95% posterior credible intervals for model 1 are given in Table 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 Fig shows that model 1 results are insensitive to chosen values of T, the rate of T-cell lysis, with qT estimates compensating for changes in T (see also S1 Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For model 1, we further re-evaluated whether chloroquine treatment had a measurable effect on viral load dynamics, with results indicating that it did not (S1 Text, S1 Table, S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sake of completeness, parameter values for model 0 are provided in S2 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fig 3 shows forward simulations of model 1s dynamics in the absence of observation noise, with 95% posterior credible intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary infection model simulations show a steeper viral decline compared to primary infection simulations (Fig 3b) due to the activation of T-cells, consistent with empirical observations [24, 25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some viral kinetic studies have shown that secondary infections have higher viral peaks than primary infections [2325, 56], simulations of model 1 do not reproduce this finding (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be because viral peaks were present in under 30% of individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model simulations further indicate that we expect NK-cell absolute counts to be lower in secondary infection relative to primary infections (Fig 3c), consistent with findings in [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Models_considering_differences_in_clinical_manifestation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if original antigenic sin of T-cells can account for differences in viral dynamics between secondary DF and DHF patients, we fit models OAS1 and OAS2 (described above), with our expectation being that  for both models and  for model OAS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4a shows the density estimates for , relative to the assigned value of 106 per day for  for models OAS1 and OAS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both models,  estimates do not appreciably differ from the value assigned to .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For model OAS1, the median log-likelihood is not higher than that of model 1, despite an additional free parameter (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BIC and DIC values for model OAS1 are higher than that of model 1, indicating that model 1 is statistically preferred over model OAS1 (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For model OAS2, Fig 4b shows the density estimates for  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though  as expected, the median posterior log-likelihood of model OAS2 is the same value as that of model 1, despite two additional free parameters (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the BIC and DIC values for model OAS2 are higher than that of model 1, indicating that model 1 is statistically preferred over model OAS2 (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sake of completeness, S2 Table shows parameter estimates for models OAS1 and OAS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) can account for differences in viral dynamics between individuals that differ in clinical manifestation, we fit model ADE (described above), with the expectation that the viral infectivity rate in DHF-manifesting individuals would exceed the viral infectivity rate in DF-manifesting individuals: .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4c shows the density estimates for parameters  and DF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While  estimates do appear to be higher than DF estimates, the difference is small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the median log-likelihood of model ADE does not differ from that of model 1 (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the higher number of free parameters in model ADE, this model therefore results in a higher BIC and DIC than model 1, such that model 1 is statistically preferred over model ADE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, for sake of completeness, S2 Table shows parameter estimates for model ADE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One reason why we might find only slight differences in viral infectivity rates between DHF-manifesting and DF-manifesting individuals is because most of the viral load data shown in Fig 1 do not include the viral peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of viral peaks, the model cannot disentangle higher viral infectivity rates  from lower incubation periods IP for DHF compared to DF patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To see if we could disentangle differences in  from differences in IP, we fit model 1 and model ADE to the subset of the viral load data in which viral peaks were present (N = 65 individuals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of fitting log(V0) and setting IPg to 5.9 days, we fit IPg and set log(V0) = 3.2 log copies/ml, the median posterior value of log(V0) for model 1 (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We adopted this approach because we expect that in these subjects the mean IP value of individuals is lower than in the full dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We incorporated a lognormal prior on IPg such that IPg  logN(log(5.9), 0.15), to ensure that the mean IPg value is between the expected 310 days [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 4 shows that the median posterior log-likelihood for model ADE in this case is higher than that of model 1, and that the BIC and DIC of model ADE are significantly lower than that of model 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that model ADE is preferred over model 1 when only viral load data containing viral peaks is considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameter values for model 1 and model ADE fits to this subset of the data are provided in S3 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fig 4d shows density estimates for model ADEs  and DF on this subset of the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates for  exceed those of DF, as expected under ADE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 Fig shows simulations of model ADE fit to this data subset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral loads peak earlier in DHF relative to DF patients (S5b Fig), and immune cells are activated earlier in DHF relative to DF patients (S5c and S5d Fig), consistent with the findings in [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Models_considering_differences_between_dengue_serotypes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether difference between serotypes may explain some of the observed variation in viral load dynamics seen in Fig 1, we next fit the three serotype-specific models described above to the viral load data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first consider model SS, which allows viral infectivity rates to differ by serotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since DENV-2 is thought to have a high replication rate [18], and DENV-2 often causes more severe disease than DENV-1 and DENV-3 [10], we hypothesize that 2  (1, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5a shows the serotype-specific density estimates of  for this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These density estimates indicate that (2, 3)  1, partially consistent with our hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that the replication rate of DENV-3 is as high as DENV-2s may be accounted for by a study finding that some DENV-3 clades cause high incidence of severe dengue disease [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address whether there is support for serotypes differing in their ability to block interferon signaling, we fit model SSq to the viral load data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on [21], we expect the strength of the innate immune response q to vary by serotype, with q3  q1  q2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5b shows the serotype-specific density estimates of q for this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this model are contrary to expectation, with q3 estimates significantly lower than the estimates for q1 or q2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, to address whether there is support for serotypes differing in their elicitation of the T-cell immune response, we fit model  to the viral load data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We specifically hypothesize that T-cell response is higher for secondary DENV-2 and DENV-3 infections than secondary DENV-1 infections (qT2, qT3)  qT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is based on work by Bashyam and coauthors [58] that found that secondary DENV-2 and DENV-3 infections were associated with higher magnitudes of CD8+ T-cell secreted cytokines than were secondary DENV-1 and DENV-4 infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the T- cell response may be higher for secondary DENV-2 and DENV-3 infections than in secondary DENV-1 and DENV-4 infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5c shows serotype-specific density estimates of qT for this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model fits are consistent with our hypothesis that qT2 and qT3 values exceed the value of qT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Table 2 shows the median log-likelihood and the BIC and DIC values for each of these three models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three models have higher log-likelihoods than model 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on BIC and DIC, the viral load data best support the model in which serotypes differ in their viral infectivity rates (model SS), followed by model .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only these two models are preferred over model 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these two models similarity in likelihood values, the models differ dramatically in their T-cell dynamics (S6 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, T-cell dynamics are similar across serotypes for model SS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the magnitude of the T-cell response for DENV-2 and DENV-3 is much higher than for DENV-1 under the  model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because we did not see peak viral load in many individuals, it was difficult to distinguish between model SS and model , since both models result in serotype-specific differences in viral clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To attempt to statistically distinguish between these two models, we again fit models to the subset of the data that contained viral peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 4 shows the medium log-likelihood, BIC and DIC values for both models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that model SS fits the data significantly better than model  based on both BIC and DIC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serotype-specific density estimates for , when fit to this subset of data, are shown in Fig 5d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the estimated IP values under model SS do not appear to differ by serotype (results not shown), regardless of whether the model is fit to the entire viral load dataset or only the data containing viral peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That incubation periods do not differ by serotype is consistent with findings from [42].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fig 6a6f show simulations of model SS (fit to the entire viral load dataset) alongside viral load data from all individuals experiencing a DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-3 infection, stratified by primary infection (Fig 6a6c) and secondary infection (Fig 6d6f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher viral infectivity rates in DENV-2 and DENV-3 infections relative to DENV-1 infections result in shorter times to peak viremia and higher viral clearance rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameter values for model SS, when fit to the entire viral load dataset, are given in Table 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameter values for model SSq and model  fits to the full dataset are provided in S2 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameter values for model SS and model  fits to this subset of the data are provided in S3 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Models_considering_differences_by_clinical_manifestation_and_between_dengue_serotypes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our dataset 76% of DENV-1 individuals and 74% of DENV-3 individuals had DF, whereas only 47% of DENV-2 individuals had DF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that our serotype-specific results were not capturing differences in clinical manifestation, rather than serotype-specific differences, we fit a model () in which viral infectivity rates were allowed to vary by clinical manifestation and by serotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We considered this parameter because the ADE model was the best clinical manifestation model to fit the data and model SS was the best serotype-specific model to fit the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We expected that, for a given serotype, individuals with DHF would have a higher viral infectivity rate than those with DF, such that: 1,DHF  1,DF, 2,DHF  2,DF and 3,DHF  3,DF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also expected, as described above, that individuals with DENV-2 would have the highest viral infectivity rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we would expect that: 2,DHF  1,DHF, 3,DHF and 2,DF  1,DF, 3,DF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7a Fig shows the density estimates of  by clinical manifestation and by serotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are similar to those of the SS model, with density estimates of 2, 3  1 for both DF and DHF viral infectivity rate estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, there is very little difference in DF and DHF estimates within a given serotype (S7a Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on BIC and DIC, there is no statistical support to favor this more complex model over model SS (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our previous analysis showed that it is difficult to disentangle a short incubation period from a high viral infectivity rate in the full dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we fit model  to the subset of the data in which viral peaks were detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  density estimates are shown in S7b Fig Based on BIC and DIC, this more complicated model is not preferred over model SS (Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, though not statistically significant, density estimates for model  (S7b Fig) show that the difference between DHF and DF  estimates for DENV-2 and DENV-3 are larger than that of DENV-1, providing some evidence for how differences in viral infectivity rates by clinical manifestation vary by serotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By fitting within-host dengue models to viral load data, we have shown these data can be used to discriminate between hypothesized within-host processes leading to differences in clinical manifestation and between dengue serotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results first indicate that much of the inter-individual variability in dengue viral load dynamics can be explained by differences in the length of individuals incubation periods (IP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This IP variation may arise because of individual differences in viral inoculum sizes, or because of individual differences in the reporting of symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may also arise because of variation in viral infectivity rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our results indicate that secondary DHF patients generally have shorter IPs than do primary and secondary DF patients (Fig 2), consistent with the hypothesis that antibody-dependent enhancement drives disease severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, our results, do not support the hypothesis that original antigenic sin of T-cells was a driver of severe disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are consistent with recent work indicating that T-cells may have net protective rather than pathologic effects in secondary infections [37, 59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In previous work by Clapham and coauthors [31], a different dengue within-host model was fit to the DENV-1 viral load data analyzed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors also found differences in the viral infectivity rate  by clinical manifestation (primary infection DF, secondary infection DF and secondary infection DHF), with 2o, DHF  2o, DF  1o, DF, providing evidence for ADE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In their most recent work in which they fit more complicated models to DENV-1 and DENV-2 viral load and antibody data, they found that the model that best fit the data was one in which they assumed antibodies directly neutralize free virus, as opposed to a model in which antibodies indirectly kill infected cells via ADCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they found that the estimated infected cell lifespan of this model was low, suggesting that another viral clearance mechanism, such as T-cells, as we found here, may also be needed to clear the infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As in [31], we made use of traditional dengue disease classifications, namely that of DF and DHF/DSS, when fitting our clinical manifestation models to viral load data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DHF/DSS can also be further subclassified into four grades of severity, where grades III and IV correspond to DSS [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that if patients manifesting DHF in our dataset were categorized into grades, DHF grade III and IV would have higher viral infectivity rates than DHF grades I and II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis would be consistent with a study which showed that maximum viral titer correlated with DHF grade [24], as has been shown in viral kinetic studies where infection is stratified by DF and DHF [23, 25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2009 reclassification of dengue disease into the broader categories of dengue without warning signs, dengue with warning signs and severe dengue can result in more infections classified as severe than the older classifications, and can obstruct serotype-specific associations with specific disease manifestations [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in a meta-study of 544 DENV-1-4 infected patients from Nicaragua, with the old classification (DF/DHF/DSS), DENV-2 was significantly associated with DHF/DSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, DENV-2 was not significantly associated with severe disease with the new classification [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our clinical manifestation and serotype-specific results would need to be reevaluated in the context of these broader DENV categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In fitting our serotype-specific models to the viral load data, we showed that DENV-1, -2, and -3 differ from one another in their viral infectivity rates , with DENV-2 and DENV-3 having higher viral infectivity rates than DENV-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding stands in contrast to Clapham and coauthors work, which did not find differences in DENV-1 and DENV-2 parameter values that contribute to viral clearance, [32], though these differences may be incorporated via inter-individual variation in other parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our own findings are consistent with the hypothesis that serotypes that cause more severe disease may have higher replication rates [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies have indicated that viral replication rates can vary by dengue genotype, with different genotypes of the same serotype having different replication rates [20, 43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, the viral load data we have analyzed do not have genotype-level resolution, although during the time period of the clinical trial (20072008), DENV-1 genotype I and the Asian-American DENV-2 genotype were dominating [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not have information about the DENV-3 genotype circulating during this time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our serotype-specific findings are consistent with a recent meta-analysis of dengue virus kinetics in non-human primates [62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This meta-analysis found that the time to detectable viremia for DENV-1 was longer than for DENV-2 and DENV-3, indicating that DENV-1 is likely to have a lower replication rate than either DENV-2 or DENV-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is also consistent with our results that show DENV-2 and DENV-3 viral load dynamics peak before the onset of symptoms, whereas DENV-1 viral load dynamics peak after the onset of symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide an explanation for why DENV-1 viral load appears to be high relative to DENV-2 and DENV-3 viral load, despite DENV-1 infections typically resulting in less severe disease [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, they highlight that measuring viral load magnitude for DENV-2 and DENV-3 infections after the onset of symptoms may not be a good predictor of disease risk because viral clearance has already begun when measurements are typically taken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results are further relevant to understanding serotype-specific differences in population-level transmissibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For many infectious diseases, viral load levels are thought to affect transmission potential [63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also the case for dengue: the probability of transmitting dengue to Aedes Aegypti has been shown to increase with viral load of the infected individual [64].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that further characterization of serotype-specific differences in viral load dynamics can improve our understanding of dengue virus transmission at the population level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our ability to distinguish between models was in part limited by the absence of viral load data early in infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, though shorter time to viral peak and high viremia magnitude is consistently associated with more severe dengue disease [2325, 56], our models were unable to reproduce these trends because we do not have enough individual viral load data that contained viral peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fitting model ADE to only the viral peak data showed that with data on early infection dynamics we could ultimately discriminate between differences in viral replication rates between individuals differing in clinical manifestation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model was able to reproduce the earlier time to peak seen during DHF infections relative to DF infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results highlight the importance of collecting data before the onset of symptoms in order to detect viral peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, our results highlight that models that result in similar viral dynamics can display very different immune cell dynamics (S6 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetic immune cell data, along with viral load data taken before the onset of symptoms, will be very useful in future work that aims to discriminate between dengue models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dengue human infection model experiments currently underway [65] will become an important resource for understanding early viral load and immune cell dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are currently DENV-2 and DENV-3 viruses that already meet dengue fever criteria for these experiments, and models of all four serotypes are being developed [65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though these models have been developed to evaluate vaccine efficacy, infecting naive individuals with these strains and obtaining many viral and immune measurements during the infection will be very useful in deciphering within-host processes leading to severe disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A final shortcoming of the viral load data we analyzed is that we do not know the primary infecting serotype for individuals experiencing a secondary heterologous infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because order of infection is known to be an important risk factor for severe disease [10], knowledge of the primary infection serotype in further analyses would allow us to disentangle how the primary infection shapes the viral kinetics of secondary heterologous infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longitudinal dengue studies in which one dengue serotype typically predominates, such as the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study in Nicaragua [66], are thus invaluable for ultimately understanding the role that order of infection plays in shaping viral dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite limitations inherent in the data, our analyses indicate that inter-individual variation in dengue viral load patterns can shed light on which within-host processes are important in regulating viral dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collection of individual dengue viral load data at fine temporal resolution, spanning the entire infection duration, will be important for further understanding the relationships between dengue viral load, disease severity, and dengue transmissibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
