Phosphorylation of the HIV-1 capsid by MELK triggers uncoating to promote viral cDNA synthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regulation of capsid disassembly is crucial for efficient HIV-1 cDNA synthesis after entry, yet host factors involved in this process remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we employ genetic screening of human T-cells to identify maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) as a host factor required for optimal uncoating of the HIV-1 core to promote viral cDNA synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of MELK inhibited HIV-1 cDNA synthesis with a concomitant delay of capsid disassembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MELK phosphorylated Ser-149 of the capsid in the multimerized HIV-1 core, and a mutant virus carrying a phosphorylation-mimetic amino-acid substitution of Ser-149 underwent premature capsid disassembly and earlier HIV-1 cDNA synthesis, and eventually failed to enter the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a small-molecule MELK inhibitor reduced the efficiency of HIV-1 replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a dose-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of HIV-1 capsid disassembly and implicate MELK as a potential target for anti-HIV therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phosphorylation of the HIV-1 capsid has long been known to regulate viral uncoating and cDNA synthesis processes, but the cellular kinases responsible for this have remained unidentified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that a host cell kinase MELK dictates optimal capsid disassembly through phosphorylation of Ser-149 in the multimerized HIV-1 core, which leads to efficient viral cDNA synthesis in target cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphorylation-mimetic capsid mutation of Ser-149 caused aberrant capsid disassembly and too-early completion of reverse transcription, and impeded nuclear entry of HIV-1 cDNA, suggesting the importance of well-ordered capsid disassembly in the early stages of viral replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discovery will facilitate understanding of the functional link among virus uncoating, reverse transcription and nuclear entry, and is expected to contribute to developing a novel strategy for AIDS therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the course of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, the virus encounters numerous bottlenecks constituted by a variety of host cell proteins essential for or inhibitory to HIV-1 replication [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV-1 particles must attach to and fuse with the plasma membrane of target cells, releasing the viral core into the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shortly after entry, the HIV-1 capsid (CA), a major component of the viral core, starts dissociating from the core [reviewed by [25]].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that optimal dissociation of CA from the HIV-1 core is required for efficient viral cDNA synthesis in target cells [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, (i) Rhesus monkey TRIM5 abrogates productive reverse transcription (RT) by accelerating the disassembly of CA [9, 10]; (ii) CA mutations that impair HIV-1 infection are unable to achieve proper uncoating and RT [68]; (iii) The prevention of RT with RT inhibitors causes CA disassembly delay [11, 12]; and (iv) Uncoating of the HIV-1 CA core is triggered following first strand transfer of reverse transcription [13]; (v) The progression of reverse transcription causes morphological and mechanical changes in the HIV-1 cores [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these observations suggest that proper dissociation of CA is functionally linked to reverse transcription of HIV-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also supported by studies showing that cytoplasmic accumulation of CPSF6 restricts HIV-1 infection through abnormal stabilization of the HIV-1 core [1517].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV-1 CA is likely to interact with multiple host cell factors during uncoating and trafficking to the nucleus [35, 18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains poorly understood how the HIV-1 core dissociation process is triggered and regulated by host factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One important consideration lies in the phosphorylation of CA because previous studies have shown that its phosphorylation plays pivotal roles in the viral life cycle [1921].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Ser-109 located in the amino-terminal domain, Ser-149 in the flexible linker and Ser-178 in the carboxy-terminal domain have been identified as major phosphoacceptor sites in CA which are essential for virus replication [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alanine substitution at Ser-109, Ser-149 or Ser-178 reduces the phosphorylation level of CA in cell-free virions and inhibits efficient viral cDNA synthesis [19, 22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these mutations cause aberrant CA assembly or impaired core stability [2123].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of other amino acid residues in CA has also been reported to contribute to viral replication [2427].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of capsid phosphorylation by virion-associated kinases, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (C-PKA) was reported to interact with and phosphorylate CA, and thus regulate viral infectivity, although the residues that were phosphorylated were not identified [28, 29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study showed that virion-associated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) phosphorylates Ser-16 in CA [30], while an earlier study showed that HIV-1 CA is not a direct substrate of MAPK/ERK2 [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the significance of the phosphorylation of each of the amino acid residues in CA and the contribution of host cell kinases to HIV-1 replication remains to be fully elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in a human T-cell line to identify host factors that contribute to HIV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a cellular kinase, MELK, is responsible for phosphorylation of the HIV-1 CA in target cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Genome-wide_RNAi_screen_identifies_MELK_as_a_host_factor_required_for_HIV-1_replication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify host cell factors involved in HIV-1 replication in human cells, we employed a genome-wide RNAi screen in the MT4C5 lymphoid cell line, a derivative of MT4 cells expressing CCR5 and susceptible to infection with CXCR4-tropic and CCR5-tropic HIV-1 strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MT4C5 cells were transduced with ten independent pools of puromycin-marked lentivirus vectors expressing a human short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library comprising  greater than 75,000 shRNAs directed against  greater than 15,000 human genes in total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transduced cells were then infected with the HIV-1NL4-3 strain which normally kills infected MT4C5 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surviving cells were then studied further (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, 32 individual shRNA sequences were obtained that potentially target host factors, including Cyclophilin A and Transportin-SR2 (TNPO3), which are known to be essential host factors [1, 31] (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, we have characterized maternal embryonic leucine-zipper kinase (MELK) in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was identified in a sub-pool resistant to HIV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MELK is a member of the AMP-activated protein kinase-related Ser/Thr protein kinase family [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports indicated that MELK is expressed mainly in the cytoplasm and is involved in different cellular processes such as cell-cycle progression, cell proliferation and pre-mRNA splicing [3337].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, involvement of MELK in HIV-1 replication has not been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether endogenous MELK is involved in HIV-1 infection, we depleted this enzyme from MT4C5 cells (MELK-KD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lentivirus-mediated stable expression of a MELK-targeting shRNA, but not that of non-targeting shRNA (Non-T), suppressed expression of MELK mRNA (Fig 1B, lower panel, compare Non-T and MELK-KD-2) and protein (Fig 1B, upper panel, compare Non-T and MELK-KD-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parental MT4C5 and MELK-KD cells showed no significant difference in growth and surface expression of CD4 and CXCR4 (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of cell-cycle progression using propidium iodide DNA staining revealed no significant differences between Non-T and MELK-KD cells after release from synchronization by demecolcine, which arrests cells in mid-metaphase of the cell cycle (S2 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of MELK markedly reduced the infectivity of HIV-1- or VSV-G- envelope-pseudotyped NL4-3luc, although there was a small difference in the HIV-1 env/HIV-1 infectivity between parental and Non-T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results suggest that MELK is required for HIV-1 infection during a post-entry stage (Fig 1C, left and middle panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of HIV-1 infection by MELK depletion with three different MELK-targeting shRNAs, 293-MELK-KD-1, 293-MELK-KD-2 and 293-MELK-KD-3, was dependent on its level of expression in the single-round infection of HEK293 cells with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1, reducing the likelihood of an off-target effect of the shRNA (S3AS3C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, similar results were obtained with MELK-depleted and CD3/CD28-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) (S3DS3F Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, MELK depletion did not affect the infectivity of the VSV-G-pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vector (Fig 1C, right panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV-1 replication in MT4C5 cells with the replication-competent NL4-3 virus was markedly inhibited by MELK depletion (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral DNA synthesis by replication-competent HIV-1 proceeded more slowly than by VSVG-pseudotyped HIV-1, continuing until 24 h after infection, as previously reported [38, 39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, MELK depletion did not significantly affect the amount of immediate early viral cDNA quantified at the R/U5 region 2 h post-infection (Fig 1E, upper panel), but profoundly reduced it thereafter by approximately 80% compared to Non-T (Fig 1E, upper panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because amplification of the R/U5 region includes both Early and Late RT products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained by quantifying viral cDNA at the pol and env regions as Late RT products (approximately 80% reduction compared to Non-T) (Fig 1E, middle and lower panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral cDNA synthesis after HIV-1 infection in the presence of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors azidothymidine (AZT) or nevirapine (NVP) was markedly reduced (Fig 1E, compare Non-T, Non-T + AZT and Non-T + NVP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results indicate that MELK is a host factor required for efficient viral cDNA synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MELK_depletion_delays_HIV-1_capsid_disassembly  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first investigated whether MELK affects HIV-1 entry using the HIV-1 virion fusion assay with -lactamase-Vpr chimeric protein incorporated into HIV-1 virions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach revealed similar efficiencies of HIV-1 entry into control Non-T and MELK-KD MT4C5 cells and a marked inhibition of HIV-1 fusion in the presence of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 [40] (Fig 2A and 2B, compare Non-T and MELK-KD-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative RT-PCR assays also showed similar amounts of incoming viral genome RNA 2 h post infection (Fig 2C, compare Non-T and MELK-KD-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next assessed whether it is involved in proper disassembly of the viral CA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the viral core interacts with MELK, we purified One-STrEP-FLAG-(OSF)-tagged MELK protein expressed in HeLa cells, and viral cores from cell-free virions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HIV-1 envelope was removed from virions and envelope-stripped cores were enriched by ultracentrifugation through a discontinuous 10% and 30% sucrose gradient with 0.1% Triton X-100 in the 10% sucrose layer, as previously reported [20] (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The envelope-stripped cores were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showing recognizable ~100 nm cone-shaped structures similar to authentic HIV-1 cores (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified OSF (N-terminal)-tagged Cyclophilin A (CypA) or FLAG-One-STrEP (FOS) (C-terminal)-tagged rhesus monkey Trim5 (rhT5) proteins, known to be HIV-1 core-binding proteins [9, 4143], were used as positive controls for binding to the HIV-1 core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pull-down assays revealed that OSF-tagged CypA or FOS2-tagged rhT5, but not OSF-tagged Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), significantly interacted with the envelope-stripped core in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2F, lower panel CA, compare lanes 23, 67 and 89).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to CypA and rhT5, MELK interacted with the envelope-stripped core (Fig 2F, lower panel CA, compare lanes 23 and 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblot analyses revealed that the envelope-stripped cores, but not enveloped virions or the CA monomer, interacted in vitro with OSF-tagged MELK (S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next tested whether MELK affects the stability of the HIV-1 core after viral entry, using a fate-of-capsid assay, as described previously [39] and summarized in Fig 2G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports showed that uncoating was closely linked to reverse transcription, using VSVG-pseudotyped lentivirus vectors that enter target cells in large numbers [13, 18, 4446] and far more quickly by endocytosis than the replication-competent HIV-1 does through CD4- and CXCR4-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As far as we know, we used for the first time replication-competent HIV-1 in the fate of capsid assay to demonstrate how MELK acts on HIV-1 in an experimental setting more relevant to human pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose to focus on the time point 8 h post infection for this fate-of-capsid assay for the following reasons: (i) previous reports showed that reverse transcription products reached a maximum 24 h after infection with replication-competent HIV-1 [38, 39]; (ii) our requirement studies indicated that the amount of total intracellular CA 4 h after infection remained so small that it was impossible to detect pelletable CA by western blotting following ultracentrifugation (S5 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies had shown that ectopic expression of the rhT5 protein accelerated uncoating and restricted HIV-1 infection, and that a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, NVP, delayed CA disassembly [9, 11, 12, 47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the validity of this fate-of-capsid assay, we established MT4C5 cell pools stably expressing C-terminally hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged rhT5 (rhT5-HA) (Fig 2H, upper panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported previously [47], rhT5 strongly inhibited HIV-1 infection (Fig 2H, lower panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control Non-T, MELK-KD, rhT5-HA-expressing cells and Non-T cells treated with NVP were infected with wild-type HIV-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the amount of HIV-1 cores in HIV-1-infected cells expressing rhT5-HA 8 h post-infection was significantly lower than in control cells (Non-T) (Fig 2I, panel CA of fraction #3, MG132[], compare Non-T and rhT5-HA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that treatment of Non-T cells with NVP 8 h post-infection caused a marked delay of CA disassembly (Fig 2I, panel CA of fraction #3, MG132[], compare Non-T and Non-T + NVP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblot analyses 2 h post-infection revealed that the levels of CA protein in the cell lysates from Non-T or MELK-KD cells were similar, indicating similar efficiency of HIV-1 entry (Fig 2I, panel CA of cell lysate 2 h, MG132[], compare Non-T and MELK-KD-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, immunoblotting 8 h post-infection revealed that the amount of HIV-1 CA in the cell lysate from MELK-KD cells was significantly larger than that from Non-T cells in the absence of MG132 (Fig 2I, panel CA of cell lysate 8 h, MG132[], compare Non-T and MELK-KD-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference was confirmed in a quantitative manner by p24 ELISA (Fig 2I, left lower bar graph, MG132 [], compare Non-T and MELK-KD-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that CA monomers dissociated from multimerized cores undergo degradation in living cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a previous report [48], degradation of incoming CA protein in our hypotonic lysis buffer was accelerated by rhT5 (Fig 2I, panel CA of cell lysate 8h, MG132[], compare Non-T and rhT5-HA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The report also showed that the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin caused markedly increased steady-state levels of incoming CA protein in the cytosol of HeLa cells expressing non-restrictive human Trim5 or rhT5 [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore used the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to retain the CA in infected cells as far as possible in order to show how much CA was actually present in infected cells at the time of the assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the inhibition of CA degradation by the proteasome revealed that similar amounts of CA were present in infected cells (Fig 2I, panel CA of cell lysate 8 h, MG132[+], compare Non-T, MELK-KD-2, rhT5-HA and Non-T + NVP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, more viral cores were found 8 h post-infection in MELK-KD cells than in Non-T cells regardless of proteasome inhibition, indicating that depletion of MELK in MT4C5 cells impaired the dissociation of CA from the HIV-1 core (Fig 2I, panel CA of fraction #3, MG132 [] and MG132[+], compare Non-T and MELK-KD-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the ratio of pelletable CA of HIV-1 cores to total CA in MELK-KD cells quantified by p24 ELISA in the absence of MG132 was significantly increased compared to Non-T cells (Fig 2J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the effects of MELK on CA disassembly were cell type-specific, similar experiments were performed with the cells used in S6AS6C Fig Immunoblotting revealed that CA in the cell lysate (S6B Fig, left upper panel) or derived from HIV-1 cores (S6B Fig, right upper panel, fraction #3) was significantly increased in HEK293 cells 8 h after VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was accomplished without any significant difference in the efficiency of VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 entry, as in MT4C5 cells (S6A Fig, compare Non-T and 293-MELK-KD-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, confirmation was obtained by quantitative p24 ELISA (S6B Fig, bottom panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in MT4C5 cells, the proportion of pelletable CA in 293-MELK-KD-3 cells was significantly greater than in control Non-T cells (S6C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteasome inhibition by MG132 treatment indicated that there were similar amounts of CA in infected cells, suggesting that MELK depletion stabilizes intracellular CA protein as in MT4C5 cells (S6D Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CA derived from viral cores in MELK-KD MT4C5 and MELK-KD HEK293 cells were increased relative to control cells at all time points examined (S6E Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly indicate that MELK is required for optimal HIV-1 capsid disassembly in newly infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Catalytic_activity_of_MELK_regulates_HIV-1_replication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transduction of MELK-depleted MT4C5 expressing an shRNA targeting the 3-untranslated region (3-UTR) of MELK (MT4C5-MELK-KD-1) with a lentivirus vector capable of expressing wild-type MELK substantially restored HIV-1 infectivity in two independent cell pools (Fig 3A, compare lanes 4 and 5 or 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a MELK mutant (T167A) that lacks catalytic activity [37] failed to do so (Fig 3A, compare lanes 4 and 7 or 8), suggesting that the kinase activity of MELK is required for efficient HIV-1 replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of endogenous MELK as well as forced expression of exogenous MELK was verified by RT-PCR and immunoblotting (S7 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether CA is a substrate for MELK, we prepared recombinant CA fused to GST (GST-HIV-CA) and employed an in vitro luminescent kinase assay, in which the amount of ADP produced in the kinase reaction was quantified (for details, see Materials and methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MELK phosphorylated ZIPtide, a substrate for MELK [49] (Fig 3B, upper panel), which was inhibited by the small-molecule MELK inhibitor OTSSP167 [50] in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3B, lower panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3C, MELK significantly phosphorylated GST-HIV-CA, but not the control GST protein (compare GST and GST-HIV-CA) or GST-HIV-CA in the presence of OTSSP167 (compare GST-HIV-CA and GST-HIV-CA + OTSSP167).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained similar results with the GST-free recombinant HIV-1 CA protein (S8 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that CA is a substrate for MELK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the results shown in Fig 2F implied that MELK preferentially recognized multimerized CA cores, we next determined whether MELK phosphorylates CA in a structure-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro luminescent kinase assays revealed that env-stripped HIV-1 cores were much more efficiently phosphorylated by MELK than GST-HIV-CA (Fig 3D, compare GST-HIV-CA and Env-stripped HIV-1 cores).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore which Ser or Thr residue(s) in CA can be phosphorylated by MELK, we generated fifteen peptides that covered all the regions containing Ser or Thr residues in CA (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro luminescent kinase assays revealed that peptides #8 and #9 were phosphorylated by MELK in a substrate dose-dependent manner (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that Thr-119, Ser-146, Thr-148 and Ser-149 of CA could be phosphorylation targets of MELK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phosphorylation_of_Ser-149_in_CA_by_MELK_regulates_HIV-1_uncoating_in_target_cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next explored whether an amino-acid substitution that mimics phosphorylation of each serine or threonine residue, Thr-119, Ser-146, Thr-148 and Ser-149, counteracts the delay of CA disassembly and reduction in viral cDNA synthesis caused by MELK depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated four mutant pNL4-3 proviral molecular clones in which each Ser or Thr residue was substituted by a glutamic acid residue so that each mutation mimics constitutive phosphorylation of the site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutant HIV-1 bearing T119E, S146E, T148E, or S149E mutations in CA were used to evaluate the efficiency of viral cDNA synthesis in MELK-KD MT4C5 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of each input CA-mutated virus was normalized by its RT activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV-1 bearing T119E, S146E or T148E poorly restored early (Fig 4A) and late (Fig 4B) cDNA synthesis in MELK-KD MT4C5 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, viral cDNA synthesis after infection with HIV-1 bearing the S149E mutation was robustly restored, and even at an earlier time point than wild-type HIV-1 (approximately 1.7-fold increase compared to Non-T-wt, 8 h post-infection) (Fig 4A and 4B, MELK-KD-2-S149E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S149E mutation did not significantly alter the amount of incoming HIV-1 RNA in MELK-KD or control Non-T MT4C5 cells (S9G Fig, compare NL4-3wt and NL4-3 CA S149E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control MT4C5 cells expressing non-target shRNA, only the S149E mutation caused an earlier peak and subsequent downturn in viral cDNA synthesis similar to that in MELK-KD MT4C5 cells (S9AS9D Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that phosphorylation of Ser-149 is likely to play an important role in the initiation of viral cDNA synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite maintenance of efficient cDNA synthesis by the S149E mutant, production of the 2-LTR circular form of viral cDNA, a marker for nuclear import, was undetectable (Fig 4C, MELK-KD-2-S149E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that this CA mutation promotes viral cDNA synthesis, but does not favor nuclear import.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV-1 bearing T119E or T148E but not S146E mutations appeared to partially restore production of the 2-LTR circular form (Fig 4C), suggesting that although these mutants failed to substantially restore viral DNA synthesis, they were still competent for nuclear entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-round infection assays using TZM-bl or LuSIV indicator cells revealed very low but detectable infectivity of HIV-1 bearing CA T119E or T148E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, infection with S146E or S149E CA mutants was undetectable (S10C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess how the S149E mutation in CA influences the kinetics of capsid disassembly, we performed a fate-of-capsid assay in control Non-T and MELK-KD MT4C5 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S149E substitution resulted in a clear decrease of the HIV-1 core not only in MELK-KD cells but also in Non-T cells, indicating that this mutation promoted the CA disassembly irrespective of the presence of MELK (Fig 4D, right panel CA, MG132[], compare lanes 1213 and 1415).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reciprocally, the soluble form of CA was markedly increased in S149E mutant-infected cells relative to NL4-3wt-infected cells (Fig 4D, middle panel CA, MG132[], compare lanes 78 and 910).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this was not due to different efficiencies of HIV-1 entry because the amounts of incoming CA were similar in the presence of MG132, which prevents the degradation of the CA monomer dissociated from the viral core in the cytoplasm (Fig 4D, panel CA of cell lysate, MG132[+], compare lanes 23 and 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the ratio of pelletable S149E CA to total CA in the absence of MG132 quantified by p24 ELISA was significantly less than that of NL4-3wt in both MELK-KD and control Non-T cells (Fig 4E, compare WT and S149E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-149 by MELK is a trigger for CA disassembly in HIV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also attempted to characterize HIV-1 with an S149A mutation expected to confer refractoriness to phosphorylation by MELK, but the titer of the S149A virus was too low to compare its infectivity with NL4-3wt and S149E mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with a previous study that the S149A mutation affects the production of infectious virions [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore evaluated the infectivity of VSV-G-envelope-pseudotyped NL4-3luc bearing the S149A mutation in CA (VSVG/NL4-3luc CA-S149A) in Non-T and MELK-KD MT4C5 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did this because the infectivity of S149A mutant virus was reported to be rescued specifically by pseudotyping with the VSV envelope protein [22, 23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S149A mutation greatly reduced the VSVG/NL4-3luc-derived reporter gene activity in parental and Non-T cells, and also, but less markedly, in MELK-KD cells (S11A Fig, panels MT4C5, Non-T and MELK-KD-2, compare CA-wt and CA-S149A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, depletion of MELK modestly reduced the reporter gene activity of VSVG/NL4-3luc CA-S149A compared to Non-T control cells (S11B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings may in part reflect unidentified dysfunctionality of this mutant CA, but also raise the possibility that MELK regulates HIV-1 replication in a manner in addition to phosphorylating CA Ser-149.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A GST-linked S149A CA (GST-HIV-CA S149A) was analyzed using the in vitro luminescent kinase assay to determine whether any other residues in CA can be phosphorylated by MELK (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Essentially no phosphorylation could be detected when activated MELK was incubated with increasing amounts of GST-HIV-CA S149A (Fig 5A, compare GST-HIV CA and GST-HIV CA S149A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To directly test the ability of MELK to phosphorylate Ser-149 in CA, we generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize only phosphorylated Ser-149 in CA (CA-S149p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5B shows that phosphorylation of virion-associated CA was undetectable with CA-S149p (top panel CA-S149p, lanes 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay with envelope-stripped core prepared as in Fig 2D to determine whether MELK phosphorylates Ser-149 of CA in the multimerized viral core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation of envelope-stripped core with recombinant MELK induced phosphorylation of S149 in a time-dependent manner (Fig 5B, top panel CA-S149p, lanes 37), which was undetectable in the presence of the immunizing peptide for CA-S149p (Fig 5B, panel Immunizing peptide [CA: 140154 S149p]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that CA-S149p specifically detects phosphorylation of S149 in CA, which was diminished in the presence of OTSSP167 (Fig 5B, panels OTSSP167 [100 nM] and OTSSP167 [500 nM]) or calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Fig 5B, bottom panel CIAP, CA-S149p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the phosphorylation of Ser-149 by MELK in vivo, we performed Phos-tag analysis to detect any mobility shift of phosphorylated proteins using Manganese2+-phos-tag SDS-PAGE [51] (Fig 5C and 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migration of CA was faster from MELK-KD MT4C5 cells than from control (Non-T) cells, indicating that MELK phosphorylates CA in HIV-1-infected cells (Fig 5C, top panel CA, compare lanes 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of cell lysate with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) further down-shifted the bands (Fig 5C, top panel CA, lanes 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, essentially no difference in the mobility shift was observed with CA-S149A in Non-T and MELK-KD cells, suggesting that the Ser-149 residue is the sole phosphorylation target of MELK (Fig 5D, top panel CA, compare lanes 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results clearly indicate that MELK regulates optimal capsid disassembly and efficient viral cDNA synthesis in target cells through phosphorylation of Ser-149 in CA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, according to the HIV Sequence Compendium 2016 published by Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Ser-149 residue in CA is highly conserved among HIV-1 strains, suggesting its important role in HIV-1 replication (S12 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Our observation that constitutive phosphorylation of Ser-149 caused premature capsid disassembly and early viral cDNA synthesis but failed to support nuclear import of viral DNA suggests that a well-ordered phosphorylation of Ser-149 during CA disassembly is required for optimal uncoating, viral cDNA synthesis and nuclear import.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next examined whether forced expression of MELK in MT4C5 cells affects HIV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of exogenous and endogenous MELK mRNA was monitored by RT-PCR (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess how MELK overexpression influences the kinetics of capsid disassembly, we performed a fate-of-capsid assay in control (CSII-control), MELK-expressing (CSII-MELK) and catalytically inactive MELK-expressing (CSII-MELK T167A) MT4C5 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of wild-type MELK resulted in an obvious decrease in pelletable CA (Fig 6B, right panels, compare CSII-control and CSII-MELK), whereas the catalytically inactive MELK rather increased them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the catalytic activity of MELK controls CA disassembly (Fig 6B, right panels, compare CSII-control and CSII-MELK T167A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of MELK but not the MELK mutant inhibited HIV-1 infection (Fig 6C, compare CSII-control, CSII-MELK and CSII-MELK T167A) and resulted in aberrant viral cDNA synthesis quite similar to the S149E CA mutant (Fig 6D, compare CSII-Control, CSII-MELK and CSII-MELK-T167A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results strongly suggest that optimal phosphorylation of CA by MELK is required for efficient HIV-1 infection at the early stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MELK_inhibitor_suppresses_HIV-1_replication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assessed whether OTSSP167 affects HIV-1 replication in MT4C5 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-round infection assays revealed that viral infectivity in the presence of OTSSP167 was substantially reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OTSSP167 compromised viral cDNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 7B) and also reduced viral infectivity in PHA-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from two healthy donors (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar results were obtained with the macrocyclic thiazole antibiotic Siomycin A (Fig 7D7F), initially identified as an inhibitor of the transcription factor FOXM1b and thereafter reported to reduce MELK expression in brain tumor stem-like cells in vitro [5254].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MELK expression was reduced by Siomycin A in a dose-dependent manner (S13A Fig), while there was no effect on MELK mRNA levels in MT4C5 cells (S13B Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV-1 replication in MT4C5 cells with the replication-competent NL4-3 virus in the presence of Siomycin A was markedly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (S13C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that a small-molecule inhibitor of MELK has potential as an anti-HIV lead compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main finding of the present study is that MELK regulates CA disassembly to promote viral cDNA synthesis through the phosphorylation of Ser-149 in CA during the early stages of HIV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MELK depletion did not significantly alter the efficiency of HIV-1 entry (Fig 2A2C), but did impair viral cDNA synthesis in association with a significant delay of CA disassembly during the early stages of HIV-1 infection (Figs 1E, 2I and 2J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although MELK was identified based on HIV-1 infection-resistant cells during a spreading-infection, the inhibition by MELK-depletion in single-round infection assays was not complete (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This seems to be due, at least in part, to the difference in MOI between single-round infection assays (MOI, 1) and the initial genome-wide RNAi screen (MOI, 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different level of inhibitory effects shown in the uncoating (~2 fold) and infectivity (~10 fold) results may be explained by the widely observed finding that changes in uncoating influence reverse transcription and nuclear translocation, thereby amplifying the effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The marked suppression of the spread of HIV-1 infection in MELK-depleted cells further suggests a role for MELK in other stages of virus replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is currently under investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct interaction of MELK with envelope-stripped core, but not with the monomeric form of CA, suggests an association between the host cell MELK and the incoming viral core in the cytoplasm (Fig 2D2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the results in Fig 3D indicate that the env-stripped HIV-1 core is a much better substrate of MELK than GST-HIV-CA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Host cell core-binding factors such as MELK that accelerate CA dissociation from the viral core, and those that stabilize the core, such as CPSF6 [1517], are likely required to achieve optimal stability of the viral core which is necessary for efficient viral cDNA synthesis in target cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further document, for the first time, phosphorylation of S149 in the multimerized viral core by MELK, and provide compelling evidence of in vivo phosphorylation of S149 (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro phosphorylation assays have shown that the HIV-1 CA is a substrate of MELK (Fig 3C) and that Thr-119, Ser-146, Thr-148, and Ser-149 are the candidate phosphorylation targets (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ser-146, Thr-148 and Ser-149 are located in the flexible linker region that may allow movement of the C-terminal domain (CTD) relative to the N-terminal domain (NTD) [5557], whereas Thr-119 is located in the amino-terminal domain of CA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The restoration of viral cDNA synthesis in MELK-KD cells by the S149E mutation is consistent with a previous report that the flexible linker region has a critical role in optimal core stability and efficient HIV-1 replication [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S149E mutation caused an earlier peak and subsequent reduction of viral cDNA synthesis in control cells as in MELK-KD cells (S9D Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection of cells overexpressing MELK with wild-type HIV-1 resulted in premature CA disassembly and aberrant viral cDNA synthesis (Fig 6B and 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results collectively indicate that unusual phosphorylation of S149 in CA by MELK misguides capsid disassembly and viral cDNA synthesis (Figs 4 and 6 and S9D Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV-1 with T119E, S146E or T148E mutations yielded less late RT product in MELK-KD cells than in control Non-T cells probably because in these mutants S149 remains intact (S9AS9C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They produced late RT products in control Non-T cells much less efficiently than did wild-type so that the proportional reduction in the late RT product was not as marked as in the wild-type (S9AS9C Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction indicates that these mutants are sensitive to MELK depletion and that the essential target of MELK is not T119, S146 or T148.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T119E and S146E mutants produced a little more late RT product than did the wild-type in MELK-KD cells (Fig 4B) and eventually failed to increase or retain this at 24 h post-infection, suggesting that these mutations promoted reverse transcription independently of MELK (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous report showed that the CA mutations E128A/R132A increased the stability of the viral core and impaired viral cDNA synthesis, while CA mutations Q63A/Q67A accelerated CA disassembly and viral cDNA synthesis, but severely impaired viral infectivity [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This appears consistent with our results that MELK depletion caused both the delay of CA disassembly and reduction in viral cDNA synthesis in target cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed here that the S149E mutation, like Q63A/Q67A mutations, accelerated CA disassembly and viral cDNA synthesis, and severely impaired nuclear import of the viral cDNA (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that successful viral cDNA synthesis may largely depend on the S149 phosphorylation-triggered CA disassembly and that appropriate timing and perhaps location of CA disassembly is necessary for the efficient nuclear import of viral cDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, previous reports showed that HIV-1 CA interacts directly with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) by binding to the cyclophilin-like domain of Nup358 [58, 59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is plausible that aberrant disassembly of S149E CA potentially at an inappropriate location renders recognition of CA by Nup358 difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapid decline in the amount of viral cDNA in S149E mutant-infected cells (Fig 4A4C and S9D Fig) also suggests that premature uncoating promotes viral DNA degradation in the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poor production of the S149E mutant virus (S10A and S10B Fig) may further explain why this residue has to be phosphorylated after entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MELK-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-149 after entry may have evolved to optimize production of infectious virions and achieve an ordered CA disassembly and efficient nuclear entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of the coupled RT and capsid disassembly, it is tempting to postulate that phosphorylation of CA leads to a conformational change that unlocks the initiation of reverse transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would in turn influence the activities of cytoplasmic factors involved in the regulation of capsid disassembly, such as MELK, and thereby further promote disassembly of the core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The poor ability of the VSVG/NL4-3luc CA-S149A virus to infect control MT4C5 cells differs from a previous observation that VSVG-pseudotyped env-deleted HIV-1 CA-S149A mutants can infect LuSIV, TZM-bl and MAGIC-5B HeLa cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be due in part to the different reporter systems and cell lines used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation that alanine substitution of Ser-149 (S149A) ablated CA phosphorylation in vitro by MELK suggests that the Ser-149 residue is the sole phosphorylation target of MELK in CA (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of difference in mobility shift of S149A CA in Non-T and MELK-KD cells shown in the Phos-tag assay further reinforces this notion (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous report showed that phosphorylation of three serine residues (Ser-109, Ser-149, and Ser-178) in CA is required for efficient reverse transcription and uncoating [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore generated S109E and S178E mutant viruses, and found that this failed to support viral cDNA synthesis in both Non-T and MELK-KD cells, suggesting that MELK is not involved in phosphorylation of Ser-109 or Ser-178 (S9E and S9F Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Phos-tag result that treatment of lysates from HIV-1-infected MELK-KD cells with CIAP further down-shifted the CA bands suggests that CA is phosphorylated by other cellular kinases in HIV-1-infected cells (Fig 5C, top panel CA, compare lanes 3 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results from S149E mutation experiments and overexpression of MELK regarding effects on viral DNA synthesis and nuclear import strongly suggest that phosphorylation of S149 under temporally and spatially appropriate conditions is important for enabling HIV-1 to proceed through the early stages of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OTSSP167 inhibits the catalytic activity of MELK while Siomycin A reduces its expression, both of which interfere with the function of MELK as a kinase and similarly reduce the infectivity of HIV-1 in PBMC (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decreases the likelihood of off-target effects of these drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, the essential role of MELK at an early stage of HIV-1 infection exemplifies another aspect of the functional links between viral capsid disassembly, cDNA synthesis and nuclear import.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings contribute to our understanding of early viral life-cycle events and raise the possibility of developing a new class of anti-HIV agents targeting viral capsid disassembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In vitro phosphorylation assays were performed with the ADP-Glo MELK kinase assay kit, following the manufacturers instructions (Promega Corp, Madison, WI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 100 ng of recombinant activated MELK was incubated with either GST, GST-HIV-CA or Env-stripped HIV-1 core proteins ranging from 100 to 2,000 ng or synthetic peptides, ZIPtide, ranging from 500 to 2,000 ng for 60 min at 30Â°C in the presence of ultrapure ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light emission was measured using the GloMAX multidetection system (Promega Corp, Madison, WI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIPtide was used as a phosphorylation standard for MELK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the detection of phosphorylated CA protein in the multimerized viral core, 200 ng of recombinant activated MELK was incubated with envelope-stripped HIV-1 core containing 100 ng of p24 at 30Â°C in the presence of ultrapure ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphorylation reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 Ã sample buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteins were subsequently processed for immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phospho-S149-CA, mouse monoclonal antibody to HIV-1 p24 (Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA), mouse monoclonal antibody to HIV-1 p17 (Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA), goat polyclonal antibody to gp120 (Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA), or rabbit monoclonal antibody to MELK (Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phos-tag_assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Briefly, 5 Ã 106 Non-T or MELK-KD MT4C5 cells were inoculated together with 2 Ã 107 RT counts of wild-type HIV-1 (HIV-1NL4-3 strain) or 5 Ã 106 RT counts of VSV-G/NL4-3luc or VSV-G/NL4-3 CA-S149A viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation at 4Â°C for 30 min, cells were further incubated at 37Â°C for 8 h. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS(-) containing 0.005% Trypsin/EDTA to remove virions from the cell surface and once with ice-cold PBS(-) to remove Trypsin/EDTA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Washed cells were resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail (NACALAI TESQUE, INC, Kyoto, Japan) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)] and incubated on ice for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Swollen cells were lysed in a 7 ml-Dounce homogenizer with a tight pestle (15 gentle strokes making a half-turn of the pestle at each stroke) and cell lysates cleared by centrifugation at 2,000 Ã g for 3 min at 4Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were separated in 10% precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels prepared with 50 M acrylamide-pendant Phos-tag ligand (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and were analyzed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-p24 antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All data are obtained from at least three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average values are presented with error bars indicating the standard deviation (SD) and the statistical significance was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnetts or Tukeys multiple comparison tests, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukeys or Sidaks multiple comparison test, or Students t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values below 0.05 (Pless_than0.05, *; Pless_than0.01, **; Pless_than0.001, ***) were considered significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unpaired two-tailed Students t-test was used for the data shown in Fig 2B, 2C, 2H and 2J to test whether the means of the two groups were significantly different (five biological replicates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnetts multiple comparison test was used for data in Figs 1C, 2I, 3A, 6B, 6C, 7B, 7C, 7E and 7F to determine whether the means of multiple groups were significantly different from a single group (five biological replicates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-way ANOVA with Tukeys multiple comparison test was used in Fig 4D to determine whether the means of four groups were significantly different from each other (five biological replicates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-way ANOVA with Tukeys multiple comparison test was used in Figs 3C, 3D and 5A to determine significant difference by comparing of the means specified by two factors (five biological replicates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-way ANOVA with Sidaks multiple comparison test was used in Fig 7A and 7D to determine significant difference by pairwise comparison of the means specified by two factors (five biological replicates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
