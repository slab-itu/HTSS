The African cynodont Aleodon (Cynodontia, Probainognathia) in the Triassic of southern Brazil and its biostratigraphic significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this contribution we report the first occurrence of the enigmatic African probainognathian genus Aleodon in the Middle-early Late Triassic of several localities from the state of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aleodon is unusual among early probainognathians in having transversely-expanded postcanine teeth, similar to those of gomphodont cynognathians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This genus was previously known from the Manda Beds of Tanzania and the upper Omingonde Formation of Namibia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Brazilian record of this genus is based upon multiple specimens representing different ontogenetic stages, including three that were previously referred to the sectorial-toothed probainognathian Chiniquodon theotonicus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a new species of Aleodon (A. cromptoni sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.) based on the specimens from Brazil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we tentatively refer one specimen from the upper Omingonde Formation of Namibia to this new taxon, strengthening biostratigraphic correlations between these strata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inclusion of A. cromptoni in a phylogenetic analysis of eucynodonts recovers it as the sister-taxon of A. brachyrhamphus within the family Chiniquodontidae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of numerous specimens of Aleodon among the supposedly monospecific Chiniquodon samples of Brazil raises concerns about chiniquodontid alpha taxonomy, particularly given the extremely broad geographic distribution of Chiniquodon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of Brazilian Aleodon and new records of the traversodontid Luangwa supports the hypothesis that at least two subzones can be recognized in the Dinodontosaurus Assemblage Zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The South American fossil record of non-mammalian eucynodonts is one of the most diverse known worldwide [13] and includes representatives of most of the major Triassic subclades (e.g., cynognathids, gomphognathids, traversodontids, chiniquodontids, ecteniniids, probainognathids, ictidosaurs, and mammaliaforms; for review see [1, 4]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While most South American Triassic eucynodont species appear to be local endemics, several have trans-basinal distributions that are useful for strengthening biostratigraphic correlations both among South American basins and with other rock units globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notable examples of South American taxa with trans-Gondwanan distributions include the cynognathian species Cynognathus crateronotus and Diademodon tetragonus from the Middle Triassic of southern Africa, Antarctica, and Argentina [510] (see also Discussion), the traversodontid genus Luangwa from the late Middle Triassic of Brazil, Namibia, and Zambia [1113], the chiniquodontid genus Chiniquodon from the late Middle to middle Late Triassic of Argentina, Brazil, Namibia, and Madagascar [1315], and the traversodontid species Menadon besairiei from the Late Triassic of Brazil and Madagascar [1618].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this contribution we report the first occurrence of the enigmatic African probainognathian Aleodon in the Middle-early Late Triassic of several localities from the state of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aleodon is unusual among early probainognathians in having transversely-expanded postcanines, similar to those of gomphodont cynognathians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new record is based upon multiple specimens, including three that were previously referred to the sectorial-toothed probainognathian Chiniquodon [14, 19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a new species of Aleodon based on the new specimens from Brazil (Fig 1) and discuss its biostratigraphic importance, as well as commenting on other Middle to Late Triassic faunal associations in South America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Aleodon_crompton_1955_Background  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aleodon brachyrhamphus was initially described by Crompton [20] based on a partial skull and lower jaws (the holotype, UMZC T906) collected by F. R. Parrington in 1933 in the Lifua Member of the Manda Beds of Tanzania [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holotype was found at locality B29 of Stockley [22], located between Gingama and Tschikongo in the southwestern portion of the Ruhuhu Valley.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crompton [20] originally described Aleodon as a gomphodont cynodont, and diagnosed it as a new genus based on the possession of a short snout and only two lower incisors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Referral to Gomphodontia was based primarily on the presence of three types of postcanines, including circular anterior, transversely expanded, ovate middle, and sectorial posterior teeth, similar to the postcanine pattern of the well-known gomphodont Diademodon tetragonus [2324].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hopson and Kitching [25] disputed the gomphodont affinities of Aleodon based on unpublished specimens with less worn dentition, and transferred Aleodon to the Chiniquodontidae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proposal was accepted in the majority of subsequent studies (e.g., [2628]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In their revision of the Chiniquodontidae, however, Abdala and Giannini [14] excluded Aleodon from the family because of well-developed lingual cingular platforms on the postcanines, which are supposed to be absent in Chiniquodon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also noted that the majority of Aleodon specimens from the Manda Beds, such as those housed in the collections of the Natural History Museum in London, are currently undescribed [14] and that further study is necessary to elucidate the phylogenetic position of this taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, Abdala and Smith [13] described a partial skull with poorly preserved dentition as Aleodon sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from the upper Omingonde Formation of Namibia, extending the geographic distribution of the genus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also provided an emended diagnosis of the species A. brachyrhamphus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Sidor et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ([29]; see also [3031]) briefly reported on new finds from the Manda Beds of Tanzania, including multiple more complete specimens of A. brachyrhamphus currently awaiting description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compared to coeval cynodonts known from extensive cranial material, Aleodon brachyrhamphus has been included in relatively few analyses of phylogenetic relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hopson and Kitching [32] were the first to include A. brachyrhamphus in a phylogenetic analysis, followed by Sidor [28] and Ruta et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these analyses recovered Aleodon as the sister taxon of Chiniquodon, with this clade nested between Lumkuia/Ecteninion and the large clade containing Probainognathus plus other, more crownward probainognathians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Access_to_specimens  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The specimens described here (Table 1) and those used for comparison belong to public collections and were examined with the explicit permission of appropriate curators and/or collection managers (see Acknowledgments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repository locations and abbreviations for all specimens cited in the text are listed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We followed all Brazilian regulations for fossil studies and we complied with the PLoS Paleontological Ethics Statement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cynodont specimens from the Dinodontosaurus Assemblage Zone (AZ; Fig 2) [3435] of southern Brazil were examined firsthand by the lead author, leading to the discovery of eight specimens referable to Aleodon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons with the type species A. brachyrhamphus were based on direct examination of specimens housed at the UMZC (Cambridge) and NHMUK (London).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements of the Aleodon specimens from Brazil are detailed in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The database of localities and tetrapod species from the Dinodontosaurus AZ (Fig 2) was based on the literature (see S1 File) and personal observation of various specimens (other than probainognathians), particularly those deposited in institutions in Rio Grande do Sul (e.g., MCN-PV, MMACR-PV-T, MPDC, UFRGS-PV-T, UFSM; see Institutional Abbreviations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the study of similarities among localities we used the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient to construct the dendrograms, using the software Past v3.13 [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GPS coordinates of the mentioned Dinodontosaurus AZ localities are available by contacting the corresponding author.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The new species named herein (Aleodon cromptoni) was included in the phylogenetic data matrix of Ruta et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [33], which includes 54 cynodont operational taxonomic units (including A. cromptoni) and 150 discrete cranial, dental, and postcranial characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modifications of character-states of some taxa (i.e., Chiniquodon, Aleodon brachyrhamphus, Probainognathus) and the complete data matrix are available in the S1 and S2 Files.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The modified data matrix (S2 File) was analyzed under equally-weighted parsimony using TNT 1.5 [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A heuristic search of 500 replicates of Wagner trees, followed by TBR branch-swapping algorithm (holding 10 trees per replication), was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All characters were treated as non-additive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bremer support [39] and bootstrap resampling analysis [40] were conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assignment_of_the_Brazilian_specimens_to_Aleodon  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MPDC-501-117 is referred to the genus Aleodon based on the presence of labiolingually-expanded postcanines with a tall main labial crest, dominated by a main cusp and a well-developed lingual platform in the preserved upper postcanine teeth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lingual platform is not developed to the same degree in any other Triassic probainognathian, including chiniquodontids [14, 15, 7879, 84], ecteniniids [8587], probainognathids [3, 74], and prozostrodontians [3, 34, 78, 79, 8891].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A posterior lower postcanine of Candelariodon barberenai, from the Dinodontosaurus AZ, was originally thought to be similar to Aleodon [92]; however, it has since been demonstrated that its dentition more closely resembles that of some prozostrodontians (e.g., Prozostrodon) and that the tooth in question is actually broken [93].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another interesting taxon in this regard is the Middle Triassic Cromptodon mamiferoides (holotype PVL 3858) from Mendoza Province, Argentina [94].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also has postcanines with a wide lingual cingulum, but unfortunately only the lower jaws are known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the lower dentition of Cromptodon is clearly distinct from that of both Aleodon species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Cromptodon, the lower postcanines have a sectorial labial crest with a conspicuous main cusp a, mesial cusp b and distal cusps c and d (cusp height = a greater than b greater than c greater than d), whereas in Aleodon the sectorial labial crest bears a conspicuous and bulbous main cusp, one very tiny mesial cusp, and two small distal cusps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sectorial labial border of the lower postcanines of Aleodon is more similar to the morphology of Chiniquodon and ecteniniids, with the main cusp strongly posteriorly angled, than that of Cromptodon, in which the main cusps are more vertically positioned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Cromptodon, the lingual cingulum is less developed, bears discrete cusps, and reaches its maximum width in the middle of the tooth row (pc3-pc4), then decreases in width in the posterior teeth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the well-preserved jaw MCN-PV 10338 of Aleodon cromptoni the lingual cingulum is the most conspicuous structure in all the postcanine teeth, being greatly expanded in both labiolingual and mesiodistal dimensions relative to the labial portion of the crown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only known specimen of Cromptodon is extremely small (~27mm dentary length), contrasting considerably with the size sample for Aleodon cromptoni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the presence of a canine-postcanine diastema in the former taxon would indicate a sub-adult or adult individual; therefore, the size difference between both taxa is notable and probably reflective of real taxonomic distinction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The postcanine dentition of Aleodon is distinctive even when compared with gomphodont cynodonts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter group, the upper postcanines bear a transverse crest, with a different position in each family, which is connected to the labial sectorial crest [80, 9596].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower postcanines are usually subrectangular with a transverse crest, usually positioned on the mesial edge in traversodontids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both upper and lower postcanine teeth develop conspicuous basins that, in conjunction with the crests, produce a mechanism for grinding [80, 96].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Aleodon, the upper and lower postcanines have a sectorial labial crest and a lingual platform, capable of rudimentary crown-to-crown occlusion, without a transverse crest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the upper and lower postcanine teeth of Aleodon exhibit a similar pattern of cusp and basin, differing from traversodontids in which the morphology of the upper postcanine teeth is clearly differentiated from that of the lowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The additional Brazilian specimens described above can also be referred to Aleodon based on the presence of postcanine teeth with a large lingual platform, and excluded from gomphodonts due to some combination of lengthy secondary palate, lack of tranverse crest on upper/lower postcanine teeth, and lack of maxillary platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some of these specimens are poorly preserved, taken together they provide a nearly-complete view of various aspects of the osteology of A. cromptoni, such as dentition (MPDC-501-117; MCN-PV 10338, UFRGS-PV-0071-T, UFRGS-PV-0146-T), primary and secondary palates (UFRGS-PV-0071-T, UFRGS-PV-0125-T, UFRGS-PV-0274-T, UFRGS-PV-0146-T), dentary morphology (MCN-PV 10338, UFRGS-PV-0122-T, UFRGS-PV-0146-T), parietal and temporal morphology (UFRGS-PV-0122-T, UFRGS-PV-0125-T, UFRGS-PV-0146-T), and postcranial morphology (UFRGS-PV-0146-T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aleodon_brachyrhamphus_and_A_cromptoni  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aleodon cromptoni and A. brachyrhamphus are clearly closely-related taxa, and at present can only be distinguished based on features of the dentition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The publication of better preserved cranial specimens of A. brachyrhamphus (hopefully forthcoming) will be required to establish additional autapomorphies of these species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we discuss the key points of comparison currently available between Aleodon cromptoni and A. brachyrhamphus:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_the_Namibian_specimen_GSN_EN-3_as_A_cromptoni  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Abdala and Smith (2009) described an isolated skull with worn dentition (GSN EN-3) from the upper Omingonde Formation of Namibia as a specimen of Aleodon (Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This specimen was referred to Aleodon on the basis of its snout proportions, secondary palate length, and tooth morphology (specifically the labiolingually-expanded, ovoid-ellipsoid postcanine crowns).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abdala and Smith [13] did not identify this specimen to species (leaving it as Aleodon sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), presumably because of its great geographic separation from the Manda Beds of Tanzania.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only possible difference they noted between this specimen and the Tanzanian material was the presence of a pineal foramen in UMZC T906 (holotype of A. brachyrhamphus), which was mentioned as present by Crompton [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they also noted that they could find no evidence of a pineal foramen when re-examining UMZC T906, and subsequent examination of that specimen by the authors of this paper (AGM and CFK) corroborates its absence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cranial morphology of GSN EN-3 is typical for Aleodon, with a tall, well-developed parietal crest and deep, robust zygomatic arches (Fig 16A and 16B), but the cranium alone does not exhibit any characters that permit identification as either A. brachyrhamphus or A. cromptoni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The postcanine tooth rows in this specimen are externally concave and point posterolaterally, terminating lateral to the subtemporal fossa in ventral view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The right postcanine tooth row preserves only one tooth (PC8), but also 11 alveoli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The left postcanine tooth row preserves 11 intact but badly worn crowns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high degree of wear on these teeth makes species referral based on their morphology somewhat suspect, which is why we consider the following identification to only be tentative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this noted, two features of the postcanine tooth row of GSN EN-3 are notable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One is the marked increase in tooth size between PC2 and PC3 (seen via alveolar dimensions on the right side) (Fig 16D and 16E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other is the very broad, rounded lingual platform present in the best-preserved postcanine crowns (particularly the left PC6, 7, and 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are both characteristics that distinguish A. cromptoni from A. brachyrhamphus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is possible that the Namibian material represents a third, endemic species of Aleodon, based on the above characters, the close geographic proximity of Rio Grande do Sul and Namibia during the Triassic, and the recent discovery of other characteristic elements of the Dinodontosaurus AZ in the upper Omingonde Formation (i.e., Stahleckeria potens; [46]), we consider it more likely that this specimen represents A. cromptoni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aleodon_versus_Chiniquodon  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Abdala and Giannini [14] revised the taxonomic composition of Chiniquodontidae, which at the time was restricted to the Middle-Late Triassic of Argentina and Brazil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They synonymized Probelesodon [73, 75, 82, 84] and the large-bodied taxon Belesodon [97] with the genus Chiniquodon [97], a taxon initially described from the Santa Maria Formation of southern Brazil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously stated differences between these taxa were explained as ontogenetic factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, material referred to Chiniquodon sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  was recognized in the Santacruzodon AZ of southern Brazil [98] and the upper Omingonde Formation of Namibia [13], and a new species, C. kalanoro, was described from the basal Isalo II beds of Madagascar [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the Chiniquodontidae currently includes: Chiniquodon theotonicus from the Chañares Formation of Argentina and Dinodontosaurus AZ of Brazil, C. sanjuanensis from the Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina, and C. kalanoro from basal Isalo II beds of Madagascar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, this genus spans a remarkably broad geographic and temporal range, extending across much of Gondwana and minimally from the Carnian to the Norian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aleodon was excluded from the Chiniquodontidae by Abdala and Giannini [14], in contrast to the previous proposals of Hopson [26] and Hopson and Kitching [32].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The features diagnosing Chiniquodontidae include (see [14]): (a) robust zygomatic arch, flared laterally; (b) angulation between the ventral edge of the maxillary zygomatic process and the anteroventral margin of the jugal; (c) pterygoid flanges greatly elongated, ending in a thin projection; (d) long secondary osseous palate; and (e) postcanines with backwardly recurved main cusps, lacking cingula or with tiny lingual cingular cusps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new described specimens of Aleodon clearly demonstrate that both Chiniquodon and Aleodon possess the same general cranial morphology, because they share the aforementioned traits (a-d), differing only in the dental feature (e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aleodon is characterized by having non-sectorial postcanine teeth bearing a conspicuous, basined lingual platform, not sharply-recurved sectorial teeth throughout the postcanine row.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The posteriormost upper postcanines of Aleodon are more sectorial in shape and bear recurved main cusps, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphology of these teeth adds additional support for a close relationship between these taxa, as previously proposed by Hopson and Kitching [32] and Ruta et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy how congruent the skull and jaw morphologies are between Chiniquodon and Aleodon despite their disparate dental forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Skull morphology is fairly consistent among the specimens referred to A. cromptoni, in which the skull length ranges from ~13cm (estimated from UFRGS-PV-0071-T) to 31cm (UFRGS-PV-0122-T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have a short, wide snout, large zygomatic arches, robust jaws, and large canines (even in the smallest specimen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the sample of specimens referred to Chiniquodon theotonicus is noticeably more heterogeneous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens from the Chañares Formation from Argentina are usually smaller in size and more slenderly built, with long, narrow snouts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This morphotype is also observed in at least one specimen that comes from the Dinodontosaurus AZ, the holotype of Probelesodon kitchingi (MCP-PV-1600-T; [81, 82]) (Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most other specimens of Chiniquodon from Brazil are poorly preserved [14, 97] and several referred specimens are still unprepared and in concretions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent of size, this morphotype bears a short snout and robust zygomatic arches (UFRGS-PV-0066-T, UFRGS-PV-1331-T (ex UFRGS-PV-0066-Tg by Abdala and Giannini [14]), with a marked concave outline between the parietal crest and the roof of the snout in lateral view (see dotted line in Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the sample from the Chañares Formation and the specimen MCP-PV-1600-T from the Dinodontosaurus AZ have a more straight dorsal outline in lateral view, slightly tapering anteriorly (Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This outline in the Chiniquodon sample from Brazil is not considered a product of postmortem processes because it appears in several specimens, with different sizes and states of preservations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, robust or gracile forms, all the postcanine teeth are sectorial (Fig 17), distinguishing Chiniquodon from Aleodon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further preparation of the extensive Brazilian sample of Chiniquodon would be greatly beneficial towards resolving the Chiniquodon-Belesodon-Probelesodon complex, and permit testing whether the aforementioned heterogeneity is attributable to taxonomy, ontogeny, and/or sexual dimorphism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The referred sample for Aleodon cromptoni includes specimens reaching skull lengths greater than any known for Chiniquodon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specimens UFRGS-PV-0274-T (27.7cm) and UFRGS-PV-122-T (31cm), both cited as the largest Chiniquodon individuals by Abdala and Giannini [14], are here considered to belong to A. cromptoni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the largest specimen currently retained in Chiniquodon is the holotype of Belesodon magnificus (GPIT/RE/7112) at 26cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining specimens from Brazil and Argentina range from ~5 to ~20cm, with the most common size range between 10 and 15cm (see [14]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_placement_of_Aleodon_cromptoni  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cladistic analysis resulted in 75 most parsimonious trees of 529 steps (Ci = 0.35, Ri = 0.72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A selected part of the strict consensus tree is shown in Fig 18 (see S1 File for the complete tree), depicting Aleodon cromptoni as sister-taxon of A. brachyrhamphus, within Chiniquodontidae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both species are supported by three ambiguous sinapomorphies: tooth-to-tooth contact because of widened postcanines (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  108(3)), bucco-lingually expanded upper postcanines (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  110(3)), and well developed lingual cingulum in lower postcanines (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  124(2)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chiniquodontidae, including Chiniquodon plus Aleodon species, is supported by four ambiguous synapomorphies: large extranasal process of the premaxilla but not contacting nasal (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2(1)), suborbital angulation between maxilla and jugal (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26(1)), posterolateral end of maxilla forms right angle ventral to jugal contact (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49(1)), and length of the secondary palate longer than the anterior border of orbit (ch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52(2)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the inter-relationships of probainognathians are not the scope of the present contribution, the clade Chiniquodontidae and the placement of the new species (A. cromptoni) are well-supported within Probainognathia, with high Bremer support values (see Fig 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biostratigraphic_implications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In recent years, radioisotopic dating from various continental formations has substantially altered our understanding of Triassic chronology and the relative ages of the major tetrapod clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, these dates have cast doubts on the reliability of vertebrate biostratigraphy for establishing the age of Triassic faunal assemblages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, interbasinal correlations were historically made at very rough levels, often establishing equivalency based on "family"-level taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, new fieldwork and re-evaluation of historic specimens has revealed significant lower-level taxonomic overlap between cynodont faunas in South America and southern Africa (Fig 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss these biostratigraphic issues below, establishing context for the importance of Aleodon in Brazil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We describe a new species of Aleodon, A. cromptoni, based on several specimens from the Dinodontosaurus AZ of the Pinheiros-Chiniquá Sequence, Santa Maria Supersequence of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One specimen, GSN EN-3, from the upper Omingonde Formation of Namibia is also tentatively referred to this species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aleodon cromptoni is clearly differentiated from A. brachyrhamphus from the Manda Beds of Tanzania [20] on the basis of its upper and lower postcanine dentition, and includes individuals that reached larger skull sizes (up to 31cm skull length) than the known sample of the Tanzanian species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inclusion of this taxon in a phylogenetic analysis provides further evidence for close relationship between Aleodon and Chiniquodon, as originally proposed by Hopson and Kitching [25], and we include both taxa in the family Chiniquodontidae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both genera share a very similar cranial morphology despite conspicuous differences in their dentition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recognition of Aleodon in Brazil, hidden in most collections with cynodonts from the Dinodontosaurus AZ, and the comparisons with the known sample of Chiniquodon from Argentina and Brazil brings to light taxonomic problems with the latter genus that require additional study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of Aleodon cromptoni in the Dinodontosaurus AZ reinforces its similarity to the upper Omingonde Formation of Namibia, which also share the dicynodont Stahleckeria potens [46] and the cynodonts Luangwa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Chiniquodon sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [13], making this one of the most strongly-correlated Gondwanan Triassic faunal associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biostratigraphic issues in South America are still controversial and further taxonomic refinements and new radiometric and geological data are required to resolve the biostratigraphy for the Middle-Late Triassic of Gondwana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
