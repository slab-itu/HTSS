Carnivore conservation needs evidence-based livestock protection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Carnivore predation on livestock often leads people to retaliate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Persecution by humans has contributed strongly to global endangerment of carnivores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preventing livestock losses would help to achieve three goals common to many human societies: preserve nature, protect animal welfare, and safeguard human livelihoods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 2016 and 2018, four independent reviews evaluated  greater than 40 years of research on lethal and nonlethal interventions for reducing predation on livestock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 114 studies, we find a striking conclusion: scarce quantitative comparisons of interventions and scarce comparisons against experimental controls preclude strong inference about the effectiveness of methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For wise investment of public resources in protecting livestock and carnivores, evidence of effectiveness should be a prerequisite to policy making or large-scale funding of any method or, at a minimum, should be measured during implementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An appropriate evidence base is needed, and we recommend a coalition of scientists and managers be formed to establish and encourage use of consistent standards in future experimental evaluations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Synthesis_of_the_science_on_functional_effectiveness  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our four reviews [69] jointly screened  greater than 27,000 candidate studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four sets of inclusion criteria differed in geographic coverage, carnivore species, and standards of evidence and research design (see S1 Table), which limited overlap in the studies that passed screening (only 19% of studies were included in two or more of the four reviews; no study was included in all four, S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differing inclusion criteria also meant that it was not possible to conduct a quantitative comparison (meta-analysis) combining the data from our four reviews, but we suggest that such an analysis should be conducted in the future as evidence increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our reviews came to remarkably similar conclusions, irrespective of methods, suggesting that our conclusions are robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among the 114 studies that passed screening in one or more reviews (S2 Table), representing  greater than 40 years of research, we found few that yielded strong inference about functional effectiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, many widely used methods have not been evaluated using controlled experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, few interventions have been compared side by side or tested singly under diverse conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These deficiencies in the literature are further compounded by disagreement among scientists, managers, and peer-reviewed journals about standards of evidence, such as which study designs produce strong inference [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge the challenges of regional experiments amid dynamic, complex ecologies, publics, and jurisdictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a handful of random-assignment experimental studies without bias (gold standard) have proven that the obstacles are surmountable [8, 10, 11, 12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We summarize our four sets of results by category of intervention in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our reviews agree that several methods have been tested numerous times with high standards of evidence and have been found effective: livestock guardian animals, enclosures for livestock, and a visual deterrent called fladry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we should recognize that the effectiveness of different methods will vary under different contexts, and there is currently a bias among research toward certain geographic regions and predator types (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we agree that standards of evidence have been higher for nonlethal methods, and there remains a need to ensure data on all interventions are collected appropriately and consistently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, building on existing criticism of the lack of appropriate data collection in environmental management [1316], our reviews collectively highlight the need to improve standards of evidence used in evaluating interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We need to develop a comprehensive evidence base that allows us to compare the effectiveness of interventions for reducing carnivore predation on livestock and inform consistent policy in any jurisdiction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sample sizes inside disks represent the number of studies or tests, as some studies reported more than one test of the same or different interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Darker colors represent reviews that included experimental or quasiexperimental controls; lighter colors represent reviews that also included comparative or correlative studies (see S1 Table for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deterrents include nonlethal interventions such as audio or visual deterrents, fladry, and livestock protection collars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enclosure/barrier includes electrified and nonelectrified fencing and corralling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guarding includes human shepherding and livestock guardian animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lethal removal includes hunting, poison baiting, and other lethal methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-lethal removal refers to translocation of carnivores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other includes carnivore sterilization and diversionary feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eklund and colleagues measured effectiveness using RR and classified Effective as RR less_than 0.90, Ineffective = 0.901.10, and Counterproductive RR  greater than  1.10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treves and colleagues measured effectiveness as significant change in livestock loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that Treves and colleagues initially contained 12 studies with 14 separate tests using gold or silver standards, but one test was subsequently removed after review of the methods found it impossible to draw strong inference [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  van Eeden and colleagues measured effectiveness as Hedges d and classified Effective as d less_than 0.05, Ineffective 0.05  greater than  d less_than 0.05, and Counterproductive d  greater than  0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Miller and colleagues measured effectiveness as percentage change in livestock loss (or carnivore behavior change) and classified Effective as d  greater than  0% change, Ineffective = 0%, and Counterproductive less_than 0%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RR, relative risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Importance_of_rigorous_experimental_design_and_evaluation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Societal values and, accordingly, policies for humancarnivore coexistence have changed over the millennia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The almost exclusive use of lethal interventions has given way to nonlethal interventions as important supplements to or replacements for prior lethal methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immense logistical and financial resources are invested in protecting livestock and carnivores, so the scarcity of rigorous scientific evidence for effectiveness should be a concern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We encourage governments to adopt proven methods from similar systems of carnivores and human interests, with systems in place to review and adapt management actions as new evidence becomes available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When governments contemplate large-scale implementation or funding for interventions, scientific evidence of functional effectiveness deserves priority to avoid wasting resources on ineffective methods, no matter if the latter are ethical or easy to implement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When no proven method is available, scientific evaluation of functional effectiveness should coincide with implementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strong inference in any scientific field demands control over potentially confounding variables and testable claims about functional effectiveness of interventions [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our context, all methods present opposable hypotheses, i.e., method X works or does not work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several experimental design components are essential to strong inference about that hypothesis, and we focus here on the three of topmost priority for yielding strong inference about livestock protection interventions: controls, randomization, and replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The strongest inference results from experiments that achieve the gold standard through random assignment to control and treatment groups without bias (systematic error) in sampling, treatment, measurement, or reporting [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This requires that an intervention be used to protect a livestock herd (treatment) and that its effectiveness is compared against a livestock herd that is not exposed to the intervention (placebo control).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both treatment and control should be replicated using multiple independent herds of livestock that are distributed so that the effects of treatment on one herd do not confound the effects on another herd, which would eliminate independence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Random assignment of treatments avoids sampling or selection bias that is common in our field [8], as in others [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Implementing random assignment for actual livestock herds can be challenging, but several studies have succeeded, such as those conducted by Davidson-Nelson and Gehring [10] and Gehring and colleagues [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Chilean altiplano, 11 owners of alpacas (Vicugna pacos) and llamas (Lama glama) joined a randomized reverse treatment (crossover) experiment to evaluate light devices in deterring carnivores [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, if large numbers of replicates are infeasible or replicates are unavoidably heterogeneous, then crossover, reverse treatment designs should help to increase the strength of inference about interventions [8, 12, S2 Table].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Silver standard designs provide weaker inference because of nonrandom assignment to treatment and then repeated measures of the replicate at two or more time points (before-and-after comparison of impact or quasiexperimental designs, also called case control).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both time passing and the treatment might explain changes in replicates, in addition to the extraneous nuisance variables present in agro-ecosystems at the outset [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The weakest standard of evidence is the correlative study, which compares livestock predation among herds that varied haphazardly in past protection or varied systematically if people intervened only where livestock had died.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In correlational studies, confounding variables inevitably create selection or sampling bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although correlative studies may be useful as an initial exploratory step and help direct further research, confidence in their findings should be low, especially if there is large variation in the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlative studies cannot substitute for the silver or gold standards described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Implementation of interventions must be consistent to avoid treatment bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the functional effectiveness of livestock-guarding dogs might vary with breed, individual, training, and maintenance of the dog.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, tests of lethal methods have never controlled the simultaneous use of several methods of intervention (e.g., pooling shooting and trapping as one treatment), which is inadvisable for strong inference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent maintenance of interventions throughout a study should also minimize treatment bias [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Well-designed experiments should incorporate evaluation along multiple dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Was the intervention implemented as planned?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Did attacks on livestock diminish?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurement bias arises from systematic error in documenting implementation or losses in treatment or response variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in biomedical research, which sometimes uses patient self-reports as a subjective measure of effectiveness alongside objective measures of health outcomes, there are valid reasons to measure owners perceptions of effectiveness of interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humanwildlife interactions, peoples attitudes can influence the adoption or rejection of interventions independently of scientific evidence [14,19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of the reviews included metrics of perceived effectiveness among livestock owners, yet perception alone is not a reliable measure of functional effectiveness because of widespread placebo effects, whereby patients feel better simply because they have participated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies should therefore either blind their participants or use an independent, verifiable measure of effectiveness (i.e., livestock loss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We recognize that gold or silver standards may be difficult to achieve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systematic errors can be difficult to eliminate entirely, so we urge careful consideration of methods during the design process, including peer review prior to initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethical considerations about exposing animals to lethal risks may limit experimental designs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inherent difficulty for controlled experiments may explain why some published experiments were completed in artificial settings (e.g., using captive carnivores or measuring bait consumption rather than livestock loss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although most of our reviews omitted experiments for protecting property other than livestock, strong inference from such studies merit tests for livestock protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, given that several examples of gold standard experiments overcame the complexities of people and wild ecosystems [5, 10, 11, 12], we urge greater effort and recommend government support and accolades for the highest standards of experimentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Incorporating_science_into_conflict_mitigation_and_conservation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many governments have institutionalized support for livestock protection from predators and implemented various interventions at landscape scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The European Council Directive 98/58/EC, concerning protection of animals kept for farming purposes, states that animals not kept in buildings shall where necessary and possible be given protection from adverse weather conditions, predators and risks to their health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Swedish Animal Welfare Act of 1988 mandates care should be given to injured animals as soon as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This obligation is in practice relevant subsequent to carnivore attacks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When trained field observers confirm livestock attacks by large carnivores, they also implement rapid response interventions, such as fladry and portable electric fences, to prevent recurrent attacks [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the United States, in 2013 alone, the US Department of Agriculture killed  greater than 75,000 coyotes, 320 gray wolves (Canis lupus), and 345 cougars (Puma concolor) [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in some Australian states, landowners and managers are required by law to actively control dingoes (C. dingo) on their property.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the weak state of current evidence about effectiveness, decisions to use interventions are most likely based on subjective factors (e.g., ethics, opinions, or perceptions) or nonscientific (and thus possibly biased) evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, many people have deeply rooted perceptions that an intervention is effective or not [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, research, promoted by policy, is needed to validate that perceptions align with measurable and scientifically defensible outcomes [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially crucial in cases of lethal interventions, which entail multiple drawbacks, including ethical criticisms and the potential to hasten carnivore declines and impede population recoveries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, scientists alone cannot transform policies for implementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pursuit of science-based management must be truly interdisciplinary and involve carnivore ecologists, animal husbandry scientists, social scientists, natural resource managers, ethicists, and other scholars and practitioners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Political leaders can also play a role to prioritize, coordinate, and fund partnerships across government agencies and nongovernment organizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we anticipate continued debate over the standards of effectiveness, we recommend a coalition be formed to clearly distinguish standards for evaluation and experimental protocols, which would be distinct from coalitions convened to consider local factors that affect decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through collaboration, scientists, managers, and policy leaders can help to protect livestock within healthy ecosystems that include carnivores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constituents worldwide increasingly support the restoration of carnivore populations and accordingly are calling for humancarnivore coexistence and minimizing conflicts [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enabling coexistence through evidence-based solutions will give the public strong confidence in methods promoted by scientists and governments, particularly when implementation is difficult or the ethics are controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
