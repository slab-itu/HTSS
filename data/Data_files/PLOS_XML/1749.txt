Imagining the open university: Sharing scholarship to improve research and education  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Open scholarship, such as the sharing of articles, code, data, and educational resources, has the potential to improve university research and education as well as increase the impact universities can have beyond their own walls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To support this perspective, I present evidence from case studies, published literature, and personal experiences as a practicing open scholar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I describe some of the challenges inherent to practicing open scholarship and some of the tensions created by incompatibilities between institutional policies and personal practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, I propose several concrete actions universities could take to support open scholarship and outline ways in which such initiatives could benefit the public as well as institutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, I do not think most of these actions would require new funding but rather a redistribution of existing funds and a rewriting of internal policies to better align with university missions of knowledge dissemination and societal impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over the last few years, we have seen growth of grassroots movements to increase access to scholarly products, such as articles, code, data, and educational resources (e.g., [15]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also seen a rise in the number of government and private funders mandating open access and open data [6,7] and the emergence of the Open Research Funders Group (http://www.orfg.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These initiatives have been key in raising awareness and acceptance of open scholarship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite these advances, I believe we have hit a wall that is impeding widespread adoption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While increasing numbers of academics may ideologically support sharing their work, many are concerned with how these practices will affect their career prospects and advancement [813].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Academic institutions are one of the primary influencers affecting how faculty perceive open scholarship and how willing they are to engage in certain practices [8, 13, 14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faculty often cite a lack of institutional support for open access, especially in evaluations, as one reason they are reluctant to publish in these journals [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, faculty express fear that open scholarship practices, especially those that fall outside the traditionally rewarded research products, will not only not be rewarded but may even hurt their evaluations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, one respondent of a 2011 survey of medical faculty [15] wrote,  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Faculty understandably pay attention to what institutions value and where evaluation committees place the most weight to decide where to invest the most personal effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a University of Idaho faculty member wrote in response to a 2013 survey [11],  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A 2015 survey in the United Kingdom found that academics are increasingly tailoring their scholarly production and publication decisions to fit institutional evaluation criteria [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, I believe universities are in a unique position to support open scholarship and break through some of the barriers to widespread adoption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This support could come in many forms, including recognition of open access and open data in promotion and tenure evaluations, small grants to support the development of open educational resources, and redirecting existing funds from proprietary software to support creation and training in open source solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simple actions could demonstrate that universities value sharing, thereby changing faculty behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such support could, in turn, have benefits for institutions, such as increased funding, visibility, and recruiting power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, the sharing of scholarly outputs could help universities meet their stated missions to create and disseminate knowledge for broader public good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What_should_universities_consider_open_scholarship?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is no one unanimously accepted definition of open scholarship; the debate continues as to what the minimum requirements and best practices are for different types of open content [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the earliest and perhaps most well-accepted international open standards are the Budapest Open Access Initiative (2002) [18], the Bethesda Statement (2003) [19], and the Berlin Declaration (2003) [20]all of which deal with open access to articles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the time these declarations were written, they were revolutionary, and their original language still guides open scholarship efforts today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, research has rapidly changed over the last 1015 years, and projects are now producing much more than just articles, including large amounts of data, different types of digital media, electronic notebooks, and complex software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, open science has emerged as an umbrella term to refer to open access, open data, open notebooks, open source, or any other aspect of our work as researchers that can be shared [21, 22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  International standards for these products have emerged, including the Open Source Definition (2007) [23] for openly licensed software and the Panton Principles for open data (2010) [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
More recently, there has been recognition that open science may not be as inclusive a term as we might like [25], and some have opted instead to refer to open research to include disciplines like the humanities [26, 27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I will use the even broader term open scholarship to encompass sharing of research and nonresearch products, such as those arising from educational and outreach activities [28, 29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I see inclusivity as crucial to the success of open scholarship as a social movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While open scholarship can encompass all of the aforementioned practices, academics do not have to engage in all of these to contribute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Openness can be considered a continuum of practices [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Researchers can start with simple actions, like self-archiving free copies of their articles, and work their way up to sharing code, data, or notebooks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Educators can begin by sharing electronic copies of their class notes and work their way up to the creation of open textbooks or interactive online materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important we welcome people at whatever level of sharing with which they are comfortable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For this to work, it is in turn important that universities have ways of recognizing diverse scholarly products and different types of sharing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But with all the different standards, how are universities to determine what counts as open scholarship?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I propose that universities take guidance from perhaps the simplest and all-encompassing international standard, the Open Definition from Open Knowledge, which states, "Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose" [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This definition can be applied to any educational or research product, allowing universities to set a clear baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colleges, schools, and departments could then set more specific standards to fit disciplinary needs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Open_scholarship_can_transform_research_and_education  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A comprehensive discussion of the benefits of open scholarship is beyond the scope of this paper (see instead [6, 31, 32]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, I focus on just a few ways sharing can transform research and education, falling largely into the democratic (equal access for all) and pragmatic (sharing improves research and education) schools of thought [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each section, I begin by outlining some of the democratic and pragmatic benefits of open scholarship, then describe how I see such practices also benefiting universities and fitting in well with institutional missions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While many of the societal benefits of open scholarship have sometimes been considered to be at odds with the interests of institutions, I argue there are several points of intersection at which what is good for the public may also be good for the university.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In my opinion, many universities have drifted away from their stated missions of knowledge dissemination, community engagement, and public good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Open scholarship provides an opportunity for universities to return to these core values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Personal_practice_of_open_scholarship  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As described previously, the success of institutional open scholarship initiatives depends in large part on the commitment of individual academics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best way researchers can support open scholarship is to share their own work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2014, at the SPARC open access meeting in Kansas City, I publicly pledged to only edit for, review for, and publish in open access journals [92].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the years since, I have committed to sharing more products of my research and teaching (Box 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other researchers have made similar individual commitments [9395] or signed on to organized pledges, both as authors (e.g., http://www.openaccesspledge.com and https://moreopenaccess.net) and as reviewers (e.g., https://opennessinitiative.org and [96]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A collection of links to open scholarship pledges can be found via [97].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Personal commitments to open scholarship are not made lightly and are often made knowing that many academic environments do not, at present, adequately support such stances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Practicing open scholarship comes with a variety of challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following is not an exhaustive list of these challenges but are some I have faced personally, along with suggestions as to how they could be addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I do not believe any of these challenges are insurmountable, but they should be considered if universities want to increase adoption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Personal_practice_meets_institutional_policy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In my view, one of the biggest challenges open scholars face at the institutional level is how they are evaluated for promotion and tenure decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are tensions created by inconsistencies between stated institutional values and evaluations in practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, institutions often emphasize the importance of community engagement and public outreach in their mission and vision statements (e.g., [62, 114, 115]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, surveys show that faculty feel this support rarely translates into recognition in promotion and tenure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretenure faculty report being actively "discouraged" from spending time on community engagement or public outreach activities that take time away from producing real scholarship, like peer-reviewed articles [60, 116118].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Harley et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  conclude that academics who spend significant time on activities like writing for the general public may be "stigmatized for being 'public intellectuals [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarly, institutions often tout the importance of collaborative and interdisciplinary research (e.g., [119, 120]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, many evaluation systems continue to focus primarily on individual accomplishments, insisting that researchers demonstrate independence, and may even include criteria that disadvantage those working in collaborative efforts [60, 121].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, some evaluation systems give priority to first or corresponding authorships and devalue middle authorships on publications, especially with larger numbers of authors [122, 123].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dominance of the journal article over other products as the "basic unit of scholarship" [124] is also a problem lamented by faculty [60, 125].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surveys report that data, software, online resources, and other digital products are often relegated to tool development, given secondary status, and may not count at all unless worked somehow into article format [60, 116].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be true even when there is interest in and use of the product by academic peers, creating a mismatch between community and institutional recognition [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The use of proxy measures, like journal impact factor (IF), to judge the quality and importance of articles is still pervasive in academic evaluations [60, 126] (e.g., [127, 128]), despite studies showing that IF correlates poorly with the scientific quality of individual works [129].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faculty report feeling intense pressure to publish in specific high IF venues [60, 126, 130].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Institutional requirements may also lead researchers to break apart research projects into smaller, less in-depth units to increase publication numbers [60, 130] or communicate their research in venues that may not reach their ideal audience, just for the sake of prestige [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is understandable that people align their practices with institutional policies related to hiring, promotion, and tenure and with the academic culture in which they find themselves embedded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, as researchers, want to get, keep, and be successful at our jobs so we can continue doing the work we enjoy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We want recognition from our peers and institution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not hard to imagine that making decisions that are contrary to what we believe is right or good for our research could create stress, job dissatisfaction, and, in some cases, weaker scholarship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of these outcomes is good for either faculty or institution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Those in senior leadership roles at universities can support faculty and promote open scholarship by ensuring that incentives exist to encourage and reward sharing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the action items listed throughout, I propose several ways that shared code, data, educational resources, outreach activities, preprints, and more could be recognized by committees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These and other suggestions to reform promotion and tenure evaluations are summarized in Box 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of these recommendations arose from discussions among the Advancing Research Communication & Scholarship (ARCS), OpenCon, and SPARC communities (http://bit.ly/PTreform), which include students, postdocs, and pretenure faculty who are understandably concerned about how evaluation criteria will affect their career prospects and advancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, while early-career researchers (ECRs) may be the best equipped to say how evaluation criteria affect career development or to propose ways of evaluating new forms of digital scholarship, they are rarely given formal opportunities to do so.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Senior leadership could support ECRs by giving them more of an institutional voice and including ECR representatives on faculty senates, hiring committees, and tenure review boards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Institutions may take even stronger stances in favor of open scholarship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A policy similar to that at the University of Liège, which requires that faculty upload their work to the institution's open access repository to be considered in promotion and tenure evaluations [132], could be put in place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, for institutions in which the governance structure does not support such a top-down approach, open scholarship initiatives will have to be discussed and agreed upon on at the level of colleges, schools, or even individual departments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Universities can also take guidance from the Leiden Manifesto on research metrics, which includes recommendations for better aligning evaluation criteria with institutional missions, considering disciplinary differences, and taking into account qualitative indicators [133].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_importance_of_institutional_culture_and_signals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reforming evaluations will be a huge step towards more widespread adoption of open scholarship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, changing policies alone will likely not be enough to transform universities and make sharing the norm rather than the exception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Problems with evaluation systems can be viewed as a symptom of a much bigger problem, namely, an academic culture that has come to favor quantity over quality, labels over content, individual over group accomplishments, and prestige over public good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Universities play a crucial role in determining this cultural environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through career advancement decisions, funding and space allocations, faculty prizes, press releases, and even website content, the university signals to academics what it values and what is required to be an accepted member of the community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in any culture, there is a sense of belonging fostered by what is seen to be a set of shared interests and values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Missions statements are intended to explicitly outline those shared interests and values for the university community, but these words can end up being empty when the institution signals through its actions that its values are different or conflicting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faculty pay acute attention to these signals and can feel strong pressure to align their practices accordingly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be especially true for faculty just starting out, who are working to integrate themselves into their new environment and become valued community members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, "the culture of an institutionis a strong force affecting faculty values and activities" [134].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, I see the actions I have proposed throughout not so much as a dramatic shift towards new academic cultural values, but more as a return to old ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broadening our definition of scholarship, valuing public engagement, wanting the university to be a force for positive social changethese are not new ideas [134136].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are old ideas that have taken a back seat to increasingly distorted priorities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I think what universities need is a realignment such that what they say they value is better reflected in how they act.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  University mission statements have to be more than just words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
I have outlined my vision of a university that endorses the principles of open scholarship, not just in words but in practice, and actively supports faculty in sharing their work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This support can span a continuum from simple steps, like providing space on evaluation forms for faculty to describe their open scholarship or outreach efforts, to more complicated actions, like the redistribution of institutional funds to finance open initiatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I realize universities may not be able to enact all the reforms I have proposed; some may not be possible due to certain university governance structures, and others may meet with significant resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if universities work towards just a few of these reforms over the next 2 to 5 years, I think they could significantly increase the adoption of open scholarship practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most impactful reforms, as suggested by faculty surveys, are likely to be changes made to evaluation criteria to better recognize and reward diverse types of open scholarship, accompanied by outward signaling from universities that these activities are valued.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such changes may be challenging to enact, but I argue it is worth the effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As universities embrace sharing, they will likely find it has broad benefits, increasing their visibility, funding, and recruitment power and, most importantly, helping institutions meet core missions like dissemination of knowledge and positive contributions to society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
