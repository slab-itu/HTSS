Genetic assessment of age-associated Alzheimer disease risk: Development and validation of a polygenic hazard score  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Background  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Identifying individuals at risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD) is of utmost importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although genetic studies have identified AD-associated SNPs in APOE and other genes, genetic information has not been integrated into an epidemiological framework for risk prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods_and_findings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using genotype data from 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls from the International Genomics of Alzheimers Project (IGAP Stage 1), we identified AD-associated SNPs (at p less_than 105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then integrated these AD-associated SNPs into a Cox proportional hazard model using genotype data from a subset of 6,409 AD patients and 9,386 older controls from Phase 1 of the Alzheimers Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), providing a polygenic hazard score (PHS) for each participant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining population-based incidence rates and the genotype-derived PHS for each individual, we derived estimates of instantaneous risk for developing AD, based on genotype and age, and tested replication in multiple independent cohorts (ADGC Phase 2, National Institute on Aging Alzheimers Disease Center [NIA ADC], and Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], total n = 20,680).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the ADGC Phase 1 cohort, individuals in the highest PHS quartile developed AD at a considerably lower age and had the highest yearly AD incidence rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among APOE 3/3 individuals, the PHS modified expected age of AD onset by more than 10 y between the lowest and highest deciles (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% CI 2.624.24, p = 1.0 × 1022).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In independent cohorts, the PHS strongly predicted empirical age of AD onset (ADGC Phase 2, r = 0.90, p = 1.1 × 1026) and longitudinal progression from normal aging to AD (NIA ADC, CochranArmitage trend test, p = 1.5 × 1010), and was associated with neuropathology (NIA ADC, Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangles, p = 3.9 × 106, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease score for neuritic plaques, p = 6.8 × 106) and in vivo markers of AD neurodegeneration (ADNI, volume loss within the entorhinal cortex, p = 6.3 × 106, and hippocampus, p = 7.9 × 105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional prospective validation of these results in non-US, non-white, and prospective community-based cohorts is necessary before clinical use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have developed a PHS for quantifying individual differences in age-specific genetic risk for AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the cohorts studied here, polygenic architecture plays an important role in modifying AD risk beyond APOE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With thorough validation, quantification of inherited genetic variation may prove useful for stratifying AD risk and as an enrichment strategy in therapeutic trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, places a large emotional and economic burden on patients and society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increasing health care expenditures among cognitively impaired elderly individuals [1], identifying individuals at risk for developing AD is of utmost importance for potential preventative and therapeutic strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inheritance of the 4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) on Chromosome 19q13 is the most significant risk factor for developing late-onset AD [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  APOE 4 has a dose-dependent effect on age of onset, increases AD risk 3-fold in heterozygotes and 15-fold in homozygotes, and is implicated in 20%25% of AD cases [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in APOE, recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous AD-associated SNPs, most of which have a small effect on disease risk [4,5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although no single polymorphism may be informative clinically, a combination of APOE and non-APOE SNPs may help identify older individuals at increased risk for AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite their detection of novel AD-associated genes, GWAS findings have not yet been incorporated into a genetic epidemiology framework for individualized risk prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Building on a prior approach evaluating GWAS-detected genetic variants for disease prediction [6] and using a survival analysis framework, we tested the feasibility of combining AD-associated SNPs and APOE status into a continuous-measure polygenic hazard score (PHS) for predicting the age-specific risk for developing AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed replication of the PHS using several independent cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participant_samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We followed three steps to derive the PHS for predicting age of AD onset: (1) we defined the set of associated SNPs, (2) we estimated hazard ratios for polygenic profiles, and (3) we calculated individualized absolute hazards (see S1 Appendix for a detailed description of these steps).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the IGAP Stage 1 sample, we first identified a list of SNPs associated with increased risk for AD, using a significance threshold of p less_than 105.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we evaluated all IGAP-detected AD-associated SNPs within the ADGC Phase 1 casecontrol dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a stepwise procedure in survival analysis, we delineated the final list of SNPs for constructing the PHS [14,15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, using Cox proportional hazard models, we identified the top AD-associated SNPs within the ADGC Phase 1 cohort (excluding NIA ADC and ADNI samples), while controlling for the effects of gender, APOE variants, and the top five genetic principal components (to control for the effects of population stratification).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We utilized age of AD onset and age of last clinical visit to estimate age-specific risks [16] and derived a PHS for each participant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each step of the stepwise procedure, the algorithm selected the one SNP from the pool that most improved model prediction (i.e., minimizing the Martingale residuals); additional SNP inclusion that did not further minimize the residuals resulted in halting of the SNP selection process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent overfitting in this training step, we used 1,000× bootstrapping for model averaging and estimating the hazard ratios for each selected SNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed the proportional hazard assumption in the final model using graphical comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess for replication, we first examined whether the predicted PHSs derived from the ADGC Phase 1 cohort could stratify individuals into different risk strata within the ADGC Phase 2 cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next evaluated the relationship between predicted age of AD onset and the empirical (actual) age of AD onset using cases from ADGC Phase 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We binned risk strata into percentile bins and calculated the mean of actual age of AD onset in that percentile as the empirical age of AD onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar fashion, we additionally tested replication within the NIA ADC subset classified at autopsy as having a high level of AD neuropathological change [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because casecontrol samples cannot provide the proper baseline hazard [17], we used previously reported annualized incidence rates by age estimated from the general US population [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each participant, by combining the overall population-derived incidence rates [18] and the genotype-derived PHS, we calculated the individuals instantaneous risk for developing AD, based on their genotype and age (for additional details see S1 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To independently assess the predicted instantaneous risk, we evaluated longitudinal follow-up data from 2,724 cognitively normal older individuals from the NIA ADC with at least 2 y of clinical follow-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed the number of cognitively normal individuals progressing to AD as a function of the predicted PHS risk strata and examined whether the predicted PHS-derived incidence rate reflected the empirical progression rate using a CochranArmitage trend test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We examined the association between our PHS and established in vivo and pathological markers of AD neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using linear models, we assessed whether the PHS associated with Braak stage for NFTs and CERAD score for neuritic plaques, as well as CSF A142 and CSF total tau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using linear mixed effects models, we also investigated whether the PHS was associated with longitudinal CDR-SB score and volume loss within the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all analyses, we co-varied for the effects of age and sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Polygenic_hazard_score__Model_development__relationship_to_APOE__and_independent_replication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the IGAP cohort, we found 1,854 SNPs associated with increased risk for AD at p less_than 105.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, using the Cox stepwise regression framework, we identified 31 SNPs, in addition to two APOE variants, within the ADGC cohort for constructing the polygenic model (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 illustrates the relative risk for developing AD using the ADGC Phase 1 casecontrol cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graphical comparisons among KaplanMeier estimations and Cox proportional hazard models indicate that the proportional hazard assumption holds for the final model (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the additional prediction provided by polygenic information beyond APOE, we evaluated how the PHS modulates age of AD onset in APOE 3/3 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these individuals, we found that age of AD onset can vary by more than 10 y, depending on polygenic risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, for an APOE 3/3 individual in the tenth decile (top 10%) of the PHS, at 50% risk for meeting clinical criteria for AD diagnosis, the expected age of developing AD is approximately 84 y (Fig 2); however, for an APOE 3/3 individual in the first decile (bottom 10%) of the PHS, the expected age of developing AD is approximately 95 y (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hazard ratio comparing the tenth decile to the first decile is 3.34 (95% CI 2.624.24, log rank test p = 1.0 × 1022).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we also evaluated the relationship between the PHS and the different APOE alleles (2/3/4) (first figure in S1 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings show that, beyond APOE, the polygenic architecture plays an integral role in affecting AD risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess replication, we applied the ADGC Phase 1trained model to independent samples from ADGC Phase 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the empirical distributions, we found that the PHS successfully stratified individuals from independent cohorts into different risk strata (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among AD cases in the ADGC Phase 2 cohort, we found that the predicted age of onset was strongly associated with the empirical (actual) age of onset (binned in percentiles, r = 0.90, p = 1.1 × 1026; Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, within the NIA ADC subset with a high level of AD neuropathological change, we found that the PHS strongly predicted time to progression to neuropathologically defined AD (Cox proportional hazard model, z = 11.8723, p = 2.8 × 1032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Predicting_population_risk_of_Alzheimer_disease_onset  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the risk for developing AD, combining the estimated hazard ratios from the ADGC cohort, allele frequencies for each of the AD-associated SNPs from the 1000 Genomes Project, and the disease incidence in the general US population [18], we generated population baseline-corrected survival curves given an individuals genetic profile and age (panels A and B of second figure in S1 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that PHS status modifies both the risk for developing AD and the distribution of age of onset (panels A and B of second figure in S1 Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given an individuals genetic profile and age, the corrected survival proportion can be translated directly into incidence rates (Fig 4; Tables 3 and S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously reported in a meta-analysis summarizing four studies from the US general population [18], the annualized incidence rate represents the proportion (in percent) of individuals in a given risk stratum and age who have not yet developed AD but will develop AD in the following year; thus, the annualized incidence rate represents the instantaneous risk for developing AD conditional on having survived up to that point in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, for a cognitively normal 65-y-old individual in the 80th percentile of the PHS, the incidence rate (per 100 person-years) would be 0.29 at age 65 y, 1.22 at age 75 y, 5.03 at age 85 y, and 20.82 at age 95 y (Fig 4; Table 3); in contrast, for a cognitively normal 65-y-old in the 20th percentile of the PHS, the incidence rate would be 0.10 at age 65 y, 0.43 at age 75 y, 1.80 at age 85 y, and 7.43 at age 95 y (Fig 4; Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As independent validation, we examined whether the PHS-predicted incidence rate reflects the empirical progression rate (from normal control to clinical AD) (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the PHS-predicted incidence was strongly associated with empirical progression rates (CochranArmitage trend test, p = 1.5 × 1010).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Association_of_polygenic_hazard_score_with_known_markers_of_Alzheimer_disease_pathology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the PHS was significantly associated with Braak stage of NFTs (-coefficient = 0.115, standard error [SE] = 0.024, p-value = 3.9 × 106) and CERAD score for neuritic plaques (-coefficient = 0.105, SE = 0.023, p-value = 6.8 × 106).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We additionally found that the PHS was associated with worsening CDR-SB score over time (-coefficient = 2.49, SE = 0.38, p-value = 1.1 × 1010), decreased CSF A142 (reflecting increased intracranial A plaque load) (-coefficient = 0.07, SE = 0.01, p-value = 1.28 × 107), increased CSF total tau (-coefficient = 0.03, SE = 0.01, p-value = 0.05), and greater volume loss within the entorhinal cortex (-coefficient = 0.022, SE = 0.005, p-value = 6.30 × 106) and hippocampus (-coefficient = 0.021, SE = 0.005, p-value = 7.86 × 105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, by integrating AD-associated SNPs from recent GWASs and disease incidence estimates from the US population into a genetic epidemiology framework, we have developed a novel PHS for quantifying individual differences in risk for developing AD, as a function of genotype and age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PHS systematically modified age of AD onset, and was associated with known in vivo and pathological markers of AD neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In independent cohorts (including a neuropathologically confirmed dataset), the PHS successfully predicted empirical (actual) age of onset and longitudinal progression from normal aging to AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even among individuals who do not carry the 4 allele of APOE (the majority of the US population), we found that polygenic information was useful for predicting age of AD onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a casecontrol design, prior work has combined GWAS-associated polymorphisms and disease prediction models to predict risk for AD [1924].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than representing a continuous process where non-demented individuals progress to AD over time, the casecontrol approach implicitly assumes that normal controls do not develop dementia and treats the disease process as a dichotomous variable where the goal is maximal discrimination between diseased cases and healthy controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the striking age dependence of AD, this approach is clinically suboptimal for estimating the risk of AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Building on prior genetic estimates from the general population [2,25], we employed a survival analysis framework to integrate AD-associated common variants with established population-based incidence [18] to derive a continuous measure, the PHS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the PHS can estimate individual differences in AD risk across a lifetime and can quantify the yearly incidence rate for developing AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings indicate that the lifetime risk of age of AD onset varies by polygenic profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the annualized incidence rate (risk for developing AD in a given year) is considerably lower for an 80-y-old individual in the 20th percentile of the PHS than for an 80-y-old in the 99th percentile of the PHS (Fig 4; Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across the lifespan (panel B of second figure in S1 Appendix), our results indicate that even individuals with low genetic risk (low PHS) develop AD, but at a later peak age of onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain loci (including APOE 2) may protect against AD by delaying, rather than preventing, disease onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our polygenic results provide important predictive information beyond APOE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among APOE 3/3 individuals, who constitute 70%75% of all individuals diagnosed with late-onset AD, age of onset varies by more than 10 y, depending on polygenic risk profile (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 60% AD risk, APOE 3/3 individuals in the first decile of the PHS have an expected age of onset of 85 y, whereas for individuals in the tenth decile of the PHS, the expected age of onset is greater than 95 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are directly relevant to the general population, where APOE 4 accounts for only a fraction of AD risk [3], and are consistent with prior work [26] indicating that AD is a polygenic disease where non-APOE genetic variants contribute significantly to disease etiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the PHS strongly predicted age of AD onset within the ADGC Phase 2 dataset and the NIA ADC neuropathology-confirmed subset, demonstrating independent replication of our polygenic score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the NIA ADC sample, the PHS robustly predicted longitudinal progression from normal aging to AD, illustrating that polygenic information can be used to identify the cognitively normal older individuals at highest risk for developing AD (preclinical AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a strong relationship between the PHS and increased tau-associated NFTs and amyloid plaques, suggesting that elevated genetic risk may make individuals more susceptible to underlying AD pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with recent studies showing correlations between AD polygenic risk scores and markers of AD neurodegeneration [22,23], our PHS also demonstrated robust associations with CSF A142 levels, longitudinal MRI measures of medial temporal lobe volume loss, and longitudinal CDR-SB scores, illustrating that increased genetic risk may increase the likelihood of clinical progression and developing neurodegeneration measured in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From a clinical perspective, our genetic risk score may serve as a risk factor for accurately identifying older individuals at greatest risk for developing AD, at a given age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceptually similar to other polygenic risk scores (for a review of this topic see [27]) for assessing coronary artery disease risk [28] and breast cancer risk [29], our PHS may help in predicting which individuals will test positive for clinical, CSF, or imaging markers of AD pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, a continuous polygenic measure of AD genetic risk may provide an enrichment strategy for prevention and therapeutic trials and could also be useful for predicting which individuals may respond to therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a disease management perspective, by providing an accurate probabilistic assessment regarding the likelihood of AD neurodegeneration, determining a genomic profile of AD may help initiate a dialogue on future planning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a similar genetic epidemiology framework may be useful for quantifying the risk associated with numerous other common diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are several limitations to our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We primarily focused on individuals of European descent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that AD incidence [30], genetic risk [25,31], and likely linkage disequilibrium in African-American and Latino individuals is different from in white individuals, additional work will be needed to develop a polygenic risk model in non-white (and non-US) populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the participants evaluated in our study were recruited from specialized memory clinics or AD research centers and may not be representative of the general US population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to be clinically useful, we note that our PHS needs to be prospectively validated in large community-based cohorts, preferably consisting of individuals from a range of ethnicities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The previously reported population annualized incidence rates were not separately provided for males and females [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we could not report PHS annualized incidence rates stratified by sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that we primarily focused on genetic markers and thus did not evaluate how other variables, such as environmental or lifestyle factors, in combination with genetics impact age of AD onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another limitation is that our PHS may not be able to distinguish pure AD from a mixed dementia presentation since cerebral small vessel ischemic/hypertensive pathology often presents concomitantly with AD neurodegeneration, and additional work will be needed on cohorts with mixed dementia to determine the specificity of our polygenic score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we focused on APOE and GWAS-detected polymorphisms for disease prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the flexibility of our genetic epidemiology framework, it can be used to investigate whether a combination of common and rare genetic variants along with clinical, cognitive, and imaging biomarkers may prove useful for refining the prediction of age of AD onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, by integrating population-based incidence proportion and genome-wide data into a genetic epidemiology framework, we have developed a PHS for quantifying the age-associated risk for developing AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measures of polygenic variation may prove useful for stratifying AD risk and as an enrichment strategy in clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
