Eight New Species of Charinus Simon, 1892 (Arachnida: Amblypygi: Charinidae) Endemic for the Brazilian Amazon, with Notes on Their Conservational Status  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eight new species of Charinus Simon, 1892 are described for the Brazilian Amazon, from the states of Pará (C. bichuetteae sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. bonaldoi sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. carajas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. ferreus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. guto sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. orientalis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n.) and Amazonas (Charinus brescoviti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. ricardoi sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All new species can be differentiated from the other species of the genus by the number of pseudo-articles in basitibia IV, the presence/absence of median eyes, and the shape of the female gonopod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brazil now becomes the country with the largest diversity of Amblypygi in the world, with 25 known species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half of the new species described here have a high degree of endangerment: C. bichuetteae sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. is threatened by the flood caused by the hydroelectric dam of Belo Monte, and C. carajas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. ferreus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. orientalis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. are endangered by the iron mining in Carajás municipality and surroundings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Charinus species here described are endemic to the Amazon Region, so in order to assure their preservation, it is strongly recommended a special care with their habitats (type localities) which are facing increasing rates of destruction and deforestation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Amblypygi is a small arachnid order with a worldwide distribution and the largest number of described species in the Neotropics [1, 2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, circa of 170 species are known and several new ones have been described in the last few years from all over the world [316].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this increase in knowledge of whip spider diversity, some countries with recognized enormous diversity of fauna still have few known Amblypygi species described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a 8,514,877 km² territory size [17] and six biomes (Amazon Forest (humid broad leaf forest), Caatinga (small woody and herbaceous deciduous, caducifolious, spiny species [18]), Cerrado (open tree and shrub woodland [19]), Atlantic Forest (costal forest), Pantanal (tropical swampland) and Pampa (grasslands)) Brazil has records of just 17 species of these arachnids in all biomes, except in the Pampa where amblypygids are not found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its presence in all these heterogenic regions shows Brazils potential to harbor high diversity due to proper environmental condition, such as favorable temperature, humidity, and availability of food, each environment in its own way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among the different Brazilian biomes, the Amazon region stands out for its huge diversity, enigmatic biogeography, and little knowledge about the species that live there.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Influenced by tectonics [20], marine transgression [2124], climate change [25, 26] paleoenvironmental changes [27], niche conservatism [2830] and dispersal ability [31], several speciation events occurred in Amazonia during the last 53 million years and there is still a lot to be unveiled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even after centuries of scientific expeditions to that forest, new species and subspecies of big vertebrates, like monkeys [32], continue to be discovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite of its incredible biodiversity, conservative measures are not efficient and several human activities threaten the Amazonian environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current most important are the construction of highways, hydroelectric dams and mining activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highways crossing areas of Amazonia effects the dispersal and migration of many species, causes border effect, allows the entry of squatters and causes deforestation by itself [3335].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydroelectric dams kill and force the migration of several species due to floods of large areas; moreover, the reservoir build artificial islands affecting the composition, abundance and richness of the species living on them [36, 37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, mining is a central issue, once this practice irreversibly destroy unique habitats, like caves; in Brazil the concern regarding conservation versus mining is even higher due to recent changes in laws which allows exploitation of protected areas and indigenous lands [38, 39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the increasing threats towards the Amazon forest it is important to unveil whip spider diversity before they disappear, as most of them are extremely sensitive to environmental changes [2] and could help identifying priority areas for directing conservation efforts [2, 14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By now only one species of Charinidae is known from this region [7], but in this paper eight new are described and illustrated; moreover, an identification key is provided for all species from the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this, the number of whip spiders' species in the country is almost doubled, and the knowledge of the group morphology is considerably increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Laboratory_procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In general, for measurements and nomenclature, we followed the proposals of Quintero [40] and for the nomenclature of the male gonopod we followed Giupponi and Kury [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pedipalp article, called tarsus by Quintero [40], is here divided in distitarsus and tarsal claw (pretarsus) as the two articles are not fused in Charinidae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements of pedipalp articles were taken between the external condiles of each segment in order to establish fixed points and proper length measurements [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were taken from several specimens (number indicated as n =) and the median value is given followed by the range in parentheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurement accuracy is indicated in the legend of each figure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maps were created using ArcMap 10.2 [42], with vector layers for countries and states/provinces and ancillary data including water body data [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparative_morphology_and_taxonomy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The female genitalia of whip spiders is considered the most reliable structure to identify and determine species identity [2, 44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weygoldt [45] defined four species groups of Charinus based on this structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are: Charinus australianus species group, Charinus brasilianus species group, Charinus bengalensis species group, and Charinus seychellarum species group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The australianus group is the most widely distributed, with species in Australia, Brazil, Cuba, New Guinea, New Caledonia, and Peru (C. australianus (L. Koch, 1867), C. acosta (Quintero, 1983), C. koepckei Weygoldt, 1972, C. milloti Fage, 1939, C. neocaledonicus Simon, 1895 in Kraepelin, 1895, C. pecki Weygoldt, 2006, C. pescotti Dunn, 1949 and C. vulgaris) [7, 12, 4652].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The group is recognized by the cushion-like gonopod and basitibia IV divided in three or four articles (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All species here described also have a rounded cushion-like gonopod (Fig 4A4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly to the only other Amazonian species of Charinus (C. vulgaris), none of the newly described species have basitibia IV divided in four articles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. brescoviti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. ricardoi sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. bonaldoi sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. bichuetteae sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. have basitibia divided in two articles, and C. guto sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. orientalis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. ferreus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. have basitibia IV divided in three articles (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All Caribbean and one of the north South American Charinus species with described gonopod also have rounded cushion-like gonopods, and should be included in the C. australianus species group; they are C. cubensis (Quintero, 1983), C. perezassoi Armas, 2010, C. platnicki (Quintero, 1986), and C. victori Armas, 2010 [3, 53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way, the number of species in the australianus species group increases to 22, and this number can get higher once more gonopods of the known and new species are described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another feature of the Amazonian species of Charinus is the small size of their structures and appendages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All species known so far from Amazonia are smaller than those of the western part of South America (C. brasilianus, C. montanus, C. asturius, C. acaraje, C. mysticus, C. troglobius, C. eleonore, C. potiguar and C. jiboassu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides that, the Amazonian species have lower number of teeth on the chelicerae claw (Charinus potiguar, C. eleonorae and C. troglobius, for example, have 11, 10 and 9 teeth, respectively; on the other hand Charinus ferreus has 7; C. brescoviti, C. carajas and C. bichuetteae, 6; C. ricardoi and C. guto, 5; and C. bonaldoi, C. orientalis and C. vulgaris, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
