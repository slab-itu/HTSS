A systems genetics resource and analysis of sleep regulation in the mouse  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sleep is essential for optimal brain functioning and health, but the biological substrates through which sleep delivers these beneficial effects remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a systems genetics approach in the BXD genetic reference population (GRP) of mice and assembled a comprehensive experimental knowledge base comprising a deep sleep-wake phenome, central and peripheral transcriptomes, and plasma metabolome data, collected under undisturbed baseline conditions and after sleep deprivation (SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present analytical tools to interactively interrogate the database, visualize the molecular networks altered by sleep loss, and prioritize candidate genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a one-time, short disruption of sleep already extensively reshaped the systems genetics landscape by altering 60%78% of the transcriptomes and the metabolome, with numerous genetic loci affecting the magnitude and direction of change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systems genetics integrative analyses drawing on all levels of organization imply -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor trafficking and fatty acid turnover as substrates of the negative effects of insufficient sleep.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses demonstrate that genetic heterogeneity and the effects of insufficient sleep itself on the transcriptome and metabolome are far more widespread than previously reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Sleep is essential for optimal brain functioning and health, but the biological substrates through which sleep delivers these beneficial effects remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a systems genetics approach in a large, diverse reference population of mice and assembled a comprehensive experimental knowledge base comprising sleep-wake data, central and peripheral gene expression, and plasma metabolic indicators, collected under undisturbed baseline conditions and after sleep deprivation (SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present analytical tools to interactively interrogate the database, visualize the molecular networks altered by sleep loss, and prioritize candidate genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a brief, one-time disruption of sleep extensively reshaped the transcriptome in cerebral cortex and liver, and the plasma metabolome, with numerous genetic loci affecting the magnitude and direction of change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrative analyses drawing on multiple sources of data imply -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor trafficking and fatty acid turnover as substrates of the negative effects of insufficient sleep.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses demonstrate that genetic heterogeneity and the effects of insufficient sleep on gene expression and metabolism are far more widespread than previously reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insufficient or disrupted sleep characterizes the 24 h lifestyle of modern society and represents a serious public health concern, as it is associated with increased risk for, e.g., obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure, and impairs cognitive performance, which in turn increases the likelihood of accidents, medical errors, and loss of productivity [1,2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several hypotheses concerning sleeps still elusive function converge on the notion that staying awake imposes a burden that can only be efficiently alleviated during sleep [37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This concept of a need for sleep accumulating during wakefulness and recovering while asleep is central in sleep research and is referred to as sleep homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insight into the molecular substrates of the sleep homeostatic process is instrumental in advancing our basic understanding of sleep need under both physiological and pathological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The impact of acute sleep deprivation (SD) on recovery sleep and cognitive performance is under strong genetic control [813], and genetic approaches therefore seem promising in uncovering the molecular pathways important in sleep homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reductionist studies in mice and flies deleting genes through gene targeting (for review, see [8]) or in mutagenesis screens [1416] have demonstrated that single genes can have large effects on various aspects of sleep, including its homeostatic regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such large single-gene (mendelian) effectsoften assessed on 1 genetic background onlyare, however, likely to be the exception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, susceptibility to sleep loss in the general population is assumed to be determined by the interactions of many genes, their natural allelic variants, and their interaction with the environment (lifestyle), a complexity that only recently has begun to be appreciated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such complexity can best be assessed in so-called genetic reference populations (GRPs), which are designed for the study of complex traits inherited in a nonmendelian fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BXD panel of advanced recombinant inbred lines (ARILs) is the largest and best-characterized GRP to date, consisting of well over 150 lines in which 2 parental (C57BL/6J [B6] and DBA/2J [D2]), now fully sequenced genomes are segregating (www.genenetwork.org; [17]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As each line represents a reproducible clone of animals, many mutually reinforcing datasets can be collected and compared at multiple levels across many biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach has been termed systems genetics, which in essence allows for making inferences about biological phenomena by assessing the flow of information from DNA to phenotype at the level of a population and how this flow is perturbed by environmental challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because systems genetics generalizes results to a population level, it is considered critical for predicting disease susceptibility [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systems genetics has been applied with great success in the BXD set for, e.g., mitochondrial function and metabolic- and aging-related phenotypes [1921].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Systems genetics approaches for sleep have been pioneered in the fly and mouse [22,23], but neither study reported on the effects of sleep loss on intermediate phenotypes, such as the metabolome and transcriptome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present an extensive and comprehensive dataset interrogating the BXD set at the levels of the genome, the brain and liver transcriptomes, the plasma metabolome, and finally, the phenome including sleep-wake state, electroencephalography (EEG)-, and locomotor activity (LMA)-related phenotypes, both under undisturbed baseline conditions and after an acute SD challenging the sleep homeostatic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that SD profoundly impacted all 3 phenotypic levels and that genetic background not only determined the magnitude but also the direction of the SD-evoked changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular pathways associated with these effects will be illustrated here to introduce our integrated data resource.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular signaling circuitry underlying the equally profound phenotypic differences observed under baseline conditions will be reported in subsequent molecular-driven validations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Systems genetics is an emerging field, and innovative ways to improve data access, portability, and reproducibility; tools to display and mine these data; and statistical models to extract the multidimensional relationships across datasets are areas of intense research [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size and complexity of our current dataset necessitated the development of new analytical tools and data sharing strategies such as (i) a supervised machine learningbased algorithm to annotate sleep-wake states on EEG/electromyogram (EMG) tracks, (ii) a gene-prioritization strategy that draws on all levels of the experimental dataset to assist the search for candidate genes within quantitative trait locus (QTL) intervals, and (iii) the implementation and integration of a recently developed systems genetics visualization tool [25] in a dynamic web-based interface that, in addition, provides access to the data presented and enables interactive data mining (https://bxd.vital-it.ch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This section is organized as follows: study design and the types of data contributing to our resource are shortly described first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then ascertain the contribution of genetic factors to all the intermediate and end phenotypes we quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the tools to interactively visualize the systems genetics relationships and to prioritize candidate genes will be described in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our current focus is on the effects of enforced wakefulness, we describe the SD-evoked changes at the level of the GRP, as well as the genetic effects thereon, before closing with 4 examples that, aided with the prioritization tool, point to novel molecular pathways shaping the marked genetic variability in the response to sleep loss at all levels of organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_design_and_input_data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We subjected mice from 33 BXD/RwwJ lines (see https://bxd.vital-it.ch; Downloads, General_Information.xlsx for a listing), the 2 parental strains (B6 and D2), and F1 individuals from reciprocal crosses between the parental lines to a deep behavioral and molecular phenotyping across 4 levels of organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1 set of mice, we recorded sleep-wake behavior, brain activity (by EEG), and LMA for 4 d (Fig 1, Experiment 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 3, mice underwent an SD challenge during the first 6 h of the light period, when mice normally sleep most of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During SD, an average of 8.6 ± 0.7 successful attempts at sleep were observed lasting 14.2 ± 0.6 s on average, resulting in a total of 1.8 ± 0.1 min (range: 0.09.8 min, n = 198 over the 33 BXD lines) of sleep or 0.5% of the 6 h intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the number of sleep episodes and total time spent asleep varied according to BXD line (1-way ANOVA, p less_than 0.0001 for both variables), while response time of the experimenter (i.e., episode duration) did not (p = 0.66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aided by a specifically developed, supervised machine learningbased algorithm (see Materials and methods and S1 Fig), we could extract a comprehensive set of EEG/behavioral phenotypes (see https://bxd.vital-it.ch; Downloads, General_Information.xlsx), which were separated into 3 main biological categories related to (i) LMA, (ii) EEG signal features, and (iii) the prevalence and time structure of sleep-wake state, collectively referred to as LMA, EEG, and State, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3 phenotypic categories were divided further into subcategories (see Materials and methods) and by experimental condition (baseline, SD, and recovery).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because some of the 341 phenotypes we quantified were tightly linked (e.g., the time spent in non-REM [NREM] sleep and wakefulness), we estimated the total number of distinct phenotypic clusters or modules to be 120 or 148 when considering phenotypes of different subclasses (e.g., EEG, State, or LMA) within a given module as separate (S2 Fig, Materials and methods, and https://bxd.vital-it.ch; Downloads, General_Information.xlsx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most phenotypes were unique or were grouped in modules of 2 phenotypes only (67%; median: 2 phenotypes/module, range: 113).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of these modules (49/120) were associated into 3 larger superclusters (Supercluster IIII; S2 Fig), containing 18, 20, and 11 modules, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supercluster I grouped almost exclusively State-related phenotypes (80/83), while Supercluster II was composed mostly of EEG-related phenotypes (65/73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supercluster III was composed of 10 LMA-related and 30 State-related phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our analyses, we still used all available phenotypes to detect potential regulatory differences among even closely related phenotypes and to avoid analysis bias arising from selecting a representative phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A second set of mice, representing the same lines, was processed in parallel for collection of brain, liver, and plasma (Fig 1, Experiment 2) to measure gene expression in cortex and liver and metabolites in plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These transcriptomic and metabolomic data are collectively referred to as (intermediate) molecular phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified 124 metabolites (see https://bxd.vital-it.ch; Downloads, General_Information.xlsx) using targeted metabolomics covering 5 important metabolite classes (i.e., amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and glycerophospholipids).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cortex and liver transcript levels were measured using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and we detected about 14,900 expressed genes in the cortex and about 14,100 genes in the liver after filtering and normalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the RNA-seq alignments also to genotype the lines to verify that no mix-up occurred during the breeding and data collection phase, and to increase mapping resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the around 500,000 detected genotypes with the publicly available 3,500-genotype set for the same BXD lines from GeneNetwork (2005 release; see Materials and methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed only an approximately 1% discrepancy and merged both genotype sets, resulting in a set of about 11,000 tag variations, which increased the number of haplotype blocks from 551 (GeneNetwork) to 1,071 (RNA-seq + GeneNetwork).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All analyses we report here were based on our merged map (see https://bxd.vital-it.ch; Downloads, Genotypes.GeneNetwork2005AndRNAseq.geno).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, by the completion of this publication, an updated set of BXD genotypes was released with an estimated haplotype block number of 816 for the specific lines we used (GeneNetwork, 2017 release http://genenetwork.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 61 significant phenotypic quantitative trait loci (phQTLs) we detected (see below), 54 were also detected using either GeneNetwork genotypes (the 2005 or 2017 release), while the remaining 7 significant phQTLs were unique to our merged genotype map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Heritability_and_QTLs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain a first sense of the contribution of genetic factors to the phenotypic variability contained within our BXD set, we examined the heritability of the EEG/behavioral and metabolic phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated narrow sense heritability [26] among the EEG/behavioral phenotypes was high overall (median h2 = 0.68, Fig 2A), consistent with what has been reported in previous human and mouse studies [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirm that various aspects of the EEG signal are among the most heritable traits with, in our dataset, theta-peak frequency (TPF) in REM sleep ranking highest (h2 = 0.89).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heritability for differential EEG/behavioral phenotypes (i.e., recovery versus baseline; green symbols in Fig 2A) were consistently lower by around 0.2 points compared with the heritabilities obtained for recovery or the baseline values per se.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrasting individual recovery values to the baseline strain averages, instead of to each animals individual baseline value (thereby keeping within strain variance similar to that of the absolute recovery values), we found that this effect did not simply reflect increased variability due to combining recovery and baseline values and thus suggests a smaller genetic contribution to the response to sleep loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall heritability of plasma metabolite levels was somewhat lower than for EEG/behavioral phenotypes (median h2 = 0.50), with alpha-aminoadipic acid (-AAA) displaying the highest heritability (h2 = 0.88; Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Average-to-high heritabilities are a requirement to attribute phenotypic variation to gene loci, but even then, there is no guarantee to find genome-wide significant QTL(s); e.g., for the TPF in REM sleep phenotype mentioned above, only 4 suggestive phQTLs of small effect size were identified (see https://bxd.vital-it.ch; Downloads, QTL_Mapping.xlsx) that together could nevertheless account for 58% of the variance (estimated using an additive model, see Materials and methods), suggesting that perhaps higher-order loci interactions (e.g., epistasis), which cannot be captured using the single-marker linkage analysis we used here, underlie differences in this EEG trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome scans revealed a total of 61 significant (false discovery rate [FDR]  0.05), 65 highly suggestive (0.05 less_than FDR  0.10), and 923 suggestive (0.10 less_than FDR  0.63) [28,29] phQTLs and 21 significant, 40 highly suggestive, and 528 suggestive metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTLs; Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several phenotypes from distinct phenotypic categories were associated with overlapping genomic regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, differences in baseline wake consolidation, gain in REM sleep time after SD, EEG delta power (1.04.0 Hz) in REM sleep, baseline levels of serotonin and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl (PC-aa)-C34:4, and levels of PC-aa-C34:4 and PC-aa-C36:6 after SD all mapped to one 30 Mb region on chromosome 10 (5080 Mb), each with a significant or highly suggestive QTL (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These overlapping QTLs may point to pleiotropic effects of 1 underlying gene or close but distinct underlying QTLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also performed QTL analysis for gene expression, but because many more linkage tests were required for transcriptome mapping, we used a more suitable method than for ph- and mQTL mapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The format for reporting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) will therefore differ from that used for ph- and mQTLs (see Materials and methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of individual genes was mapped separately for cis-eQTLs with genetic markers within a 2 Mb window and trans-eQTLs with markers positioned throughout the genome (see Materials and methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcriptome of BXD mice showed strong linkage with genotypic variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in the cortex, the expression of 5,704 genes (i.e., 38% of all expressed genes) was significantly driven by a cis-variation (Fig 2C and https://bxd.vital-it.ch; Downloads, cis_eQTL.xlsx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, 2,465 (34%) of all genes under cis-eQTL effect in both tissues passed the 0.05 FDR cutoff in a single condition and tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factors contributing to this tissue/condition specificity are the absence of gene expression in one of the 2 tissues or a different gene regulatory environment on which SD had pervasive effects (see Pervasive effects of SD at all levels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This important tissue/condition specificity also applied to trans-eQTLs with 5,537 (53% of 10,450) being under trans-eQTL effect only in one specific tissue or condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the observation that a large portion of eQTLs reached significance in 1 tissue and condition only does suggest widespread gene × environment interactions regulating gene expression, reaching the 0.05 FDR threshold or not does not prove this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore compared linkage strength of significant cis-eQTLs that were specific for 1 tissue and condition with that in the 3 other RNA-seq sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 870 genes with a significant cis-eQTL effect in sleep-deprived cortex only (Fig 2C), 175 (20%) showed a significant difference in linkage signal (FDR less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proportion was similar in the control cortex and liver (19% and 21%, respectively) and somewhat higher in sleep-deprived livers (32%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Systems_genetics_visualization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The complexity of multilevel networks can only be appreciated through visual aids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the widely used hairball representation, in which biological factors are represented as nodes and their interconnections as edges, is hardly interpretable due to its nondeterministic structure (Fig 3A), we opted for a structured representation more suitable for the visualization of complex systems, namely, hiveplots [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hiveplots were laid out as follows: each plot represents 1 EEG/behavioral phenotype and its associated molecular networki.e., only the genes and metabolites strongly correlated with a given phenotype are displayed (Fig 3B; see Materials and methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each hiveplot is composed of 3 radial axes containing the molecular data with nodes assigned to the 2 bottom axes for genes expressed in the cortex (Fig 3B left, in blue) and liver (Fig 3B right, in red), while nodes on the vertical axis (Fig 3B top, in yellow) represent metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On top, we added a separate genetic axis (Fig 3B top, white) containing the genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The node position on the 3 (molecular) radial axes was determined by the response to SDi.e., molecules positioned closer to the center were down-regulated more strongly, while more up-regulated genes/metabolites can be found closer to the axes perimeter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Edges connecting nodes represent positive/negative correlations (red/blue, respectively) between measurements of expression/metabolite levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic markers linked to genes by eQTLs connect the genetic and molecular space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hiveplot representation allows investigation of the molecular network associated with an EEG/behavioral phenotype in a structured manner and comparison of phenotypes using all intermediate phenotypic layers available in the dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in presence or absence of nodes/edges between 2 phenotypes indicates which association was gained or lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the importance of the SD effect on these nodes can be visually estimated by their position along the axis (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the interphenotype connectivity present in the hairball representation is lost in the printed format of these hiveplots, this aspect can be easily accessed through our web interface (https://bxd.vital-it.ch) by highlighting common edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The web interface also allows for an in-depth exploration of the data by displaying node details, such as gene and metabolite name, and variation identifiers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also lets the user modify the parameter settings, such as the correlation strength used to include correlated genes and metabolites, with which the hiveplots are generated (see S3 Fig and the tutorial on https://bxd.vital-it.ch; Help).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Systems_genetics_prioritization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed an unbiased, data-driven approach to select candidate genes associated with our EEG/behavioral and metabolic phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on genes located in the associated genomic regions found by QTL analyses (see Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate these often quite large regions (mean = 9.8 Mb, range = 0.734.7 Mb for significant and highly suggestive phQTLs), we implemented a scoring strategy inspired by the similarity profiling prioritization strategy [30], which combines multiple sources to prioritize a gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each gene, we computed an integrated score composed of (i) the genomic position of the gene with respect to the ph-/mQTL peak, (ii) a detected cis-eQTL driving the expression of the gene, (iii) a protein-damaging annotation of a variant, (iv) differential expression (DE) after SD, and (v) correlation between expression and phenotype of interest (Fig 3D, S4 Fig, see Materials and methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our prioritization strategy thus aimed at identifying genes that are sensitive to sleep loss, correlated with the phenotype being evaluated, associated to a cis-eQTL, and/or carrying a protein-damaging variant that could contribute to trait variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Henikoff weighting algorithm was applied to correct for intrinsic correlations among the 5 analysis scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One informative example of such intrinsic correlation is a cis-eQTL located within a phQTL region, in which case the phenotypegene expression correlation will be influenced by linkage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The algorithm decreases the cis-eQTL score accordingly, and cis-eQTLs therefore usually contributed with a low score to the prioritization (see S1 Table for examples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrated score for each gene was computed with the given formula (Fig 3D), and an FDR was computed by performing 10,000 permutations (S4 Fig and Materials and methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each QTL, we kept the gene with the highest significant integrated score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scoring strategy was applied to cortex and liver data separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To illustrate our prioritization algorithm, we applied it to the metabolite with the highest heritability, -AAA (see above), and for which we obtained a highly significant mQTL on chromosome 2 (logarithm of odds ratio [LOD] = 9.25, 111 Mb).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We readily identified Dhtkd1 as the top-ranked significant candidate gene in liver within the chromosome 2 mQTL (Fig 3E) because of (i) the strong correlation of Dhtkd1 expression with -AAA levels, (ii) Dhtkd1 is under a cis-eQTL effect (rs222492362, chr2: 5.8 Mb, q = 1.5e17), (iii) the marker of the cis-eQTL is located within the peak of the mQTL, and (iv) both -AAA and Dhtkd1 levels are affected similarly by SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 5 scores and weights of this example and those obtained in Examples 14 (see below) are detailed in S1 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This result can be taken as a first validation of our scoring strategy because Dhtkd1 encodes an enzyme subunit involved in lysine degradation known to control -AAA levels in BXD lines [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although with this particular example, the prioritization tool did successfully select the causative gene underlying the -AAA mQTL, it is important to note that, as opposed to other tools that have been developed (e.g., [32,33]), our algorithm cannot infer causality and is designed to help select likely candidate genes within m- and phQTLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pervasive_effects_of_SD_at_all_levels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The EEG/behavioral and molecular phenotypes were assessed both under undisturbed baseline conditions and after 6 h SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SD profoundly and significantly impacted a majority of measurements at all levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed the well-known increase in EEG delta power (1.04.0 Hz) during NREM sleep as well as the increase in the time spent asleep (Fig 4A), both reflective of an accumulated homeostatic sleep pressure during SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gain in time spent in NREM sleep was strongest during the initial 12 h following the SD, with an average gain of +23 min (compared with values reached during corresponding baseline hours) during the first 6 h after the SD (zeitgeber time [ZT]612) and +32 min during the first 6 h of the following dark period (ZT1218).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most strongly affected sleep phenotype concerned time spent in REM sleep, which displayed a 3.3-fold gain during the first 6 h of darkness (ZT1218) after SD (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SD thereby doubled the proportion of REM sleep to NREM sleep in this interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locomotor activity and waking phenotypes were generally decreased during the light period immediately following the SD (ZT612).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, the plasma metabolome was profoundly altered by SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 124 measured metabolites, 75 (60%) were significantly up- or down-regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of all amino acids were significantly altered after SD, the majority being down-regulated, with the exception of glutamine, glutamate, and tryptophan, which were up-regulated (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent publication reported similar effects on amino acid levels in brain dialysates of sleep-deprived rats [35], suggesting that plasma can report on central changes in amino acid levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, tryptophan was the only amino acid that was found significantly changed during SD in humans using the same methodology [36].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2 acylcarnitines present in our dataset (C18:1 and C18:2) were both strongly up-regulated with a greater than 2-fold change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were found in humans, with acylcarnitines levels increased in blood and carnitines increased in urine after sleep loss [36,37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transcriptome was especially sensitive to SD, with 78% of all expressed genes being differentially expressed in cortex and 60% in liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cortex, the most strongly differentially expressed genes were activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc), early growth response 2 (Egr2), and perilipin 4 (Plin4), with an almost 8-fold increase in expression after SD (see S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arc is an immediate early gene crucial for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arc is among the most consistently up-regulated transcripts after SD [39] and features in a short list of 78 genes, the expression of which we found reliably and significantly changed by extended wakefulness under a number of experimental conditions [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty-nine other genes in this short list featured among the top 5% most affected transcripts of the current experiment (S2 Table and blue symbols in Fig 4C left; enrichment p = 5.6e43, Fisher test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 29 of this short list were all significantly affected by SD also in the current study, 15 of which were found in the 5%10% tile, and all ranked in the top 26% of most differentially expressed genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, Egr2 is 1 of 3 Egr genes that are rapidly induced by SD in several species [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Egr1 and Egr3 appear on our short list of 78, and all 3 Egrs are among the top-100 differentially expressed cortical genes in the current study (S2 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Egr family are immediate early genes encoding transcription factors important in neuronal plasticity [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plin4, which encodes a lipid dropletassociated protein involved in lipid storage [41], has not been reported previously as part of the SD response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tubulin tyrosine ligase-like family 8 (Ttll8), encoding a ligase that glycylates microtubules [42], and family with sequence similarity 107, A (Fam107a), a stress- and glucocorticoid-regulated gene [43,44], were the top differentially expressed genes in liver (S3 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the short list of 78 was based on forebrain samples, 17 genes were also present in the top 5% differentially expressed genes in the liver (blue symbols in Fig 4C right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, 13 genes were common to the top 5% list in cortex, liver, and the 78 genes of the short list (Hspa1a/b, Cirbp, Fos, P4ha1, Chordc1, Dusp1, Slc5a3, Hsph1, Creld2, Tra2a, Zbtb40, and Pfkfb3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genes might be interesting candidates for tissue-independent biomarkers of sleep pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genetics_of_the_effects_of_SD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the context of our project, a key question is whether genetic background modifies these pervasive effects of SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found evidence for this at all 3 levels of organization and detected genomic loci predicting differences not only in the magnitude of the response to SD but also in the direction of the response (illustrated in Fig 4D4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the analyses, we included both the levels reached after the SD and these levels contrasted with their baseline levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These contrasts will be referred to as change, increase, gain, decrease, or DE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For 7 EEG/behavioral gain phenotypes we discovered a significant QTL (https://bxd.vital-it.ch; Downloads, QTL_Mapping.xlsx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Illustrated in Fig 4D is the gain in time spent in REM sleep, which mapped significantly to chromosome 18 (LOD = 3.9; 5762 Mb) with B6-allele carriers gaining more REM sleep than D2-carriers (genotype × SD interaction: p = 2.0e5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three more gain phenotypes will be discussed in detail below (see Example 1, 3, and 4 in the Systems genetics of the effects of SD section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also illustrated in Fig 4D is an EEG/behavioral gain phenotype with a pronounced genotype effect on the direction of change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SD-induced changes in EEG activity in the fast gamma band (5580 Hz) in NREM sleep mapped suggestively to chromosome 6 (LOD = 2.83; 7789 Mb), with a majority of B6-allele carriers at the QTL peak position having a significant decrease in fast gamma, while several D2-allele carriers showed a significant increase (genotype × SD interaction: p = 1.0e5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Examples of 2 genetically driven metabolic responses to SD are illustrated in Fig 4E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in PC-ae-C32:2 after SD mapped significantly to chromosome 5 (LOD = 3.6; 5869 Mb; genotype × SD interaction: p = 2.0e3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in acylcarnitine C18:1, the strongest among all metabolites assayed (Fig 4B), mapped suggestively to chromosome 18 (LOD = 3.6; 7375 Mb; genotype × SD interaction: p = 2.0e3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an additional 79 metabolites, a significant genotype × SD interaction was obtained that mapped at the suggestive level (see https://bxd.vital-it.ch; Downloads, Genotype_SD_Interaction.xlsx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, significant cis-eQTLs were detected for the DE (i.e., recovery versus control) of 195 genes after SD in cortex and 62 in liver (see https://bxd.vital-it.ch; Downloads, Genotype_SD_Interaction.xlsx and cis_eQTL.xlsx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strongest cis-allele in cortex was found for the DE of phospholipase A2, group IVE (Pla2g4e; rs47077493, chr2: 118.3 Mb, q = 1.2e9) with a down-regulation that was 2-fold larger in B6- than in D2-allele carriers (genotype × SD interaction: p = 1.0e9; Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also illustrated are the effects of SD on malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (Mlycd) expression for which a cis-eQTL was identified (rs33610973, chr8: 120.8 Mb, q = 1.9e5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BXD lines carrying a B6-allele at the cis-eQTL position, a down-regulation of Mlycd was observed, while the opposite was true for D2-allele carriers (genotype × SD interaction: p = 2.0e4; Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pla2g4e encodes a phospholipase promoting the formation of free fatty acids (FFAs), while Mlycd encodes an enzyme promoting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One last example of a significant differential cis-eQTL, for Werner syndrome RecQ like helicase (Wrn), will be discussed in detail below (see Example 1 in the Systems genetics of the effects of SD section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that for most of the significant differential cis-eQTLs, including Wrn, DE and the absolute expression after SD were highly correlated (0.5; 140/195 in cortex), and both were regulated by shared cis-eQTLs (161/195).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Systems_genetics_of_the_effects_of_SD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the following 4 sections, we highlight 4 phenotypes quantified during recovery from SD that emerged from our systems genetics analyses because of the presence of strong genetic evidence at all levels of organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two concern the levels of EEG delta power reached after SD, 1 concerns the gain in time spent in NREM sleep during recovery, and, as a last example, the changes in TPF during REM sleep in recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While for the first 3 phenotypes abundant evidence exists documenting their change with SD and their relevance in optimal daytime functioning and health, the latter phenotype (which has not been reported on previously) illustrates that, depending on genotype, a phenotype can either increase or decrease after sleep loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this example shows that phenotypes considered strictly central (i.e., the frequency of hippocampal theta oscillations) are strongly associated with genomic loci affecting gene expression in the periphery and not in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to point out that the genomic loci identified for these 4 recovery phenotypes appear after SD only and not (even at the suggestive level) under baseline conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of equal importance is pointing out that our analyses cannot provide causal proof; instead, the systems genetics approachs power lies in generating new hypotheses that need experimental confirmation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first step in that direction was made in Example 4 below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have generated a rich, multidimensional, experimentally determined knowledge base, drawing on 4 levels of organization from the DNA level to steady-state RNA levels in brain and liver, circulating metabolites, and a deep phenome of sleep-wake-related phenotypes, all under 2 experimental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the core of this knowledge base is the BXD ARIL resource.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mouse GRP provides a population model with a controlled and stable degree of genetic variation, each line carrying a fixed and unique pattern of recombination of the 2 parental chromosomes [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The panel segregates for approximately 5.2 million sequence variants corresponding to about half of all common genetic variation among classic laboratory mouse strains [97].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This level of genetic complexity exceeds that in many human populations, such as the Icelandic and Finnish populations that have been so useful in genetics of disease [98100].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results underscore the power of the BXD panel in discovering the genetic and molecular underpinnings of clinically relevant traits already demonstrated in other research fields [1921].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We extracted 341 sleep-wake-related phenotypes belonging to 120 distinct phenotypic modules from each individual mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half of these phenotypes had higher than 0.68 heritability, indicating that they are amenable to genetic dissection even when using only 33 ARILs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although numerous knockout studies have shown that (lack of) single genes impact many of the phenotypes we quantified (for review, see [8,101]), we demonstrate here that even highly heritable traits are determined by the interaction of several small-effect loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two striking examples of such traits are TPF during REM sleep and the gain in 2 power after SD, for which we identified 4 and 5 suggestive QTLs, respectively, that together explained 58% and 75% of the genetic variance in these 2 traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while reductionist approaches have been successful at identifying genes affecting sleep in a mendelian fashion, when studied at a more natural population level, most of these phenotypes represent complex traits, and mendelian (or null) alleles are likely to play a lesser role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To systematically explore these nonadditive, multiloci interactions at the level of the whole genome, innovative algorithms in the area of machine learning are needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, more than 2-way epistatic interactions are computationally challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are therefore now exploring novel multiloci epistatic approaches to extract this type of information (see, e.g., [102,103]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the 4 examples described, we could only illustrate a fraction of all the novel information contained in our experimentally derived knowledge base.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we focused on the effects of sleep loss exclusively because systems genetics resources in this research domain are lacking and because of the immediate clinical relevance of these effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the pathways we identified were unique to the sleep-deprivation condition and did not explain phenotypic variance of the respective traits under undisturbed baseline conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This illustrates that already a relatively mild sleep disruption (preventing sleep during half of the rest phase) extensively reshapes the systems genetics landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The power of systems genetics lies in generating hypotheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current dataset, several observations imply SD to challenge fatty acid turnover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides Acot11which regulates the levels of FFAs and, as we show here, the recovery of NREM sleepalso Cyp4a32, which contributes to the SD-induced shift in the frequency of theta oscillation in REM sleep, encodes an enzyme regulating fatty acid levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This frequency shift was strongly correlated with levels of the branched amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which, in turn, are part of a fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The link between Cyp4a32 and the dominant frequency of theta oscillatory activity also illustrates the importance of a peripheral molecular pathway in regulating brain activity, as Cyp4a32 was not expressed in brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is of relevance because although many studies have emphasized the deleterious effect of sleep loss on peripheral systems, research on the substrate of sleep need largely remains brain centric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Pla2g4e and Mlycd, the 2 genes with the strongest cis-eQTL effect for their DE after SD, both encode enzymes affecting fatty acid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acot11, the Cyp4a gene family, FFA levels, and sleep restriction have all been linked to obesity and insulin resistance [82,91,9396].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another pathway of importance in mediating the effects of sleep loss concerns AMPA-R trafficking supported by the 8-fold increase in cortical Arc expression and Kif16bs role in shaping 2 power after SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both genes encode proteins involved in the endosomal trafficking of AMPA-Rs (see Results) that have already been explored as therapeutic targets to counter the deleterious effects of SD on cognition [73,76].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Wrns association with EEG slow waves during NREM sleep offers a model system to mechanistically study the molecular pathways underlying the characteristic age-related decrease in the prevalence of EEG slow waves and sleep quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hypotheses concerning the involvement of the pathways in the sleep homeostatic process we discovered need to be further tested experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a reverse genetics approach, we could already confirm Acot11s role in the recovery of sleep time lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is, however, not always informative or possible, because a lack of protein on a given genetic background is unlikely to mimic the impact of an allelic variant in a genetically diverse population, or the knockout might be lethal, as is the case for Kif16b [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts to comprehensively phenotype (including sleep) knockouts for all known and predicted mouse genes by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC; www.mousephenotype.org) are ongoing, but unfortunately, no knockouts for the 4 genes we highlight here have been submitted for phenotyping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another important community resource is the mostly mouse-oriented database GeneNetwork (www.genenetwork.org), which hosts a massive amount of phenotypic and molecular information collected by the many researchers using the same BXD resource.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are in the process of structuring our database to enable sharing of the integrated data in GeneNetwork according to the FAIR data management concepts [104].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, cross-species validation in, e.g., humans, flies, and Caenorhabditis elegans and Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) and biobank database searches are important additional ways of validating and extending our mouse observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the human GWAS databases grasp.nhlbi.nih.gov and www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/, SNP variants in Acot11 are significantly associated with (among others) the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease, behavioral disinhibition, cardiovascular disease, and triglyceride levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants in Wrn are associated with aging and time to death, cardiovascular disease, cholesterol, and daytime rest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, variants in the human ortholog of Cyp4a32, CYP4A11, are associated with blood metabolite levels, including amino acids and acyl carnitines, and Kif16b variants with intelligence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A first evaluation of the systems genetics field has highlighted a clear need for better communication, open science, and collaboration among groups [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toward this aim, we have shared our results and analyses through an easily accessible and reproducibility-oriented web interface that accompanies this publication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope that the interactivity of the web interface will encourage the reader to further mine our data, thereby reproducing our conclusions and, hopefully, discovering other key regulators and pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our analyses, we have also strived to follow the concepts of the FAIR data management approach [104], resulting in a data life cycle management plan, open access provided by the web interface for data mining, and, importantly, interoperability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implementation of the FAIR approach will be illustrated in an accompanying publication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have applied a systems genetics approach to uncover new genes and pathways associated with the effects of sleep loss, an approach thought critical for predicting disease susceptibility [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This integrative, multilevel approach allowed us to follow the flow of information from DNA variants to molecular intermediate phenotypes to behavioral and electrophysiological end phenotypes, and to assess how this network of multiscale effects is perturbed by an environmental challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The information gained could not have been achieved through other genetic approaches that are based on the 1-gene-to-1-phenotype approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, with the tools and web interface we developed, our open-access knowledge base provides a unique resource that goes well beyond merely cataloguing and ranking ph-, m-, and eQTLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, owing to the use of a GRP, the database and its content are easily scalable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first challenge will be to complement the dataset with females of the same lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we are expanding the database with an additional intermediate phenotypenamely, the SD-induced changes in chromatin accessibilityaiming to identify the variants in noncoding regulatory elements that could predict the varying molecular and phenotypic response to sleep loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteome, microbiome, and inflammasome data are obvious other intermediate phenotypes that will further strengthen this knowledge base and increase its value to, e.g., assist with identifying biomarkers gauging sleep pressure and potential therapeutic targets for sleep-wake-related disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ethics_statement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experiments followed international guidelines and were approved by the veterinary authorities of the state of Vaud, Switzerland (SCAV authorization #2534).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals assigned to Experiment 1 (see Experimental design below and Fig 1) were equipped with chronic EEG and EMG electrodes under deep anesthesia according to methods described in detail in [105].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, IP injection of Xylazine (10 mg/kg)/Ketamine (100 mg/kg) ensures a deep plane of anesthesia for the duration of the surgery (i.e., around 30 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analgesia was provided the evening prior and the 3 d after surgery with Dafalgan in the drinking water (200300 mg/kg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were allowed to recover for at least 10 d prior to baseline recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals assigned to Experiment 2 (see Experimental design below and Fig 1) were killed by decapitation after being anesthetized with isoflurane, upon which blood, cerebral cortex, and liver samples were collected immediately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Animals__breeding__and_housing_conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We phenotyped 33 BXD RI strains originating from the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (Memphis, TN, United States of America).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 33 lines were randomly chosen from the then available, newly generated ARIL panel [17], although lines with documented poor breeding performance were not considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two breeding trios per BXD strain were purchased from a local facility (EPFL-SV, Lausanne, Switzerland) and bred in-house until sufficient offspring was obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parental strains D2 and B6 and their reciprocal F1 offspring (B6D2F1 [BD-F1] and D2B6F1 [DB-F1]) were bred and phenotyped alongside.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suitable (age and sex) offspring was transferred to our sleep-recording facility, where they were singly housed, with food and water available ad libitum, at a constant temperature of 25°C and under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (LD12:12, fluorescent lights, intensity 6.6 cds/m2, with ZT0 and ZT12 designating light and dark onset, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male mice aged 1114 wk at the time of experiment were used for phenotyping, with a mean of 12 animals per BXD line among all experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that 3 BXD lines had a lower replicate number (n), with respectively BXD79 (n = 6), BXD85 (n = 5), and BXD101 (n = 4) because of poor breeding success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the remaining 30 BXD lines, replicates were distributed as follows: for EEG/behavioral phenotyping (Experiment 1 in Fig 1; mean = 6.2/line; 5  n  7) and for molecular phenotyping (Experiment 2 in Fig 1; mean = 6.8/line; 6  n  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, to assess the stability of outcome variables over time, parental lines were phenotyped twicei.e., at the start (labeled B6-1 and D2-1) and end (labeled B6-2 and D2-2) of the breeding and data-collecting phase, which spanned 2 y (March 2012December 2013).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To summarize, distributed over 32 experimental cohorts, 227 individual mice were used for behavioral/EEG phenotyping (Experiment 1) and 256 mice for tissue collection for transcriptome and metabolome analyses (Experiment 2), the latter being divided into sleep deprived (SD) and controls (Ctr; see Experimental design section below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We strived to randomize the lines across the experimental cohorts so that biological replicates of 1 line were collected/recorded on more than 1 occasion while also ensuring that an even number of mice per line was included for tissue collection so as to pair SD and Ctr individuals within each cohort (for behavioral/EEG phenotyping, each mouse serves as its own control).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The study consisted of 2 experiments, i.e., Experiments 1 and 2 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals of both experiments were maintained under the same housing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals in Experiment 1 underwent surgery and, after a 10 d recovery period, EEG and LMA were recorded continuously for a 4 d period starting at ZT0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first 2 d were considered baseline (B1 and B2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first 6 h of Day 3 (ZT06), animals were sleep deprived in their home cage by gentle handling [105].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 18 h of Day 3 and Day 4 were considered recovery (R1 and R2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half of the animals included in Experiment 2 were sleep deprived (SD) alongside the animals of Experiment 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other half was left undisturbed in another room (i.e., control or Ctr).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both SD and Ctr mice of Experiment 2 were killed at ZT6 (i.e., immediately after the end of the SD) for sampling of liver and cerebral cortex tissue as well as trunk blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were left undisturbed for at least 2 d prior to SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA-seq_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA-seq data were processed using the Illumina Pipeline Software version 1.82.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All RNA-seq samples passed FastQC quality thresholds (version 0.10.1) and could thus be used in subsequent analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For gene expression quantification, we used a standard pipeline that was already applied in a previous study [111].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads were mapped to MGSCv37/mm9 using the STAR splice aligner with the 2pass pipeline [112].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Count data was generated using htseq-count from the HTseq package using parameters stranded = reverse and mode = union [113].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene boundaries were extracted from the mm9/refseq/reflat dataset of the UCSC table browser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EdgeR was then used to normalize read counts by library size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes with a mean raw read count below 10 were excluded from the analysis, and the raw read counts were normalized using the TMM normalization [114] and converted to log counts per million (CPM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although for both tissues, the RNA-seq samples passed all quality thresholds, and among-strain variability was small, more reads were mapped in cortex than in liver (S6 Fig), and we observed a somewhat higher coefficient of variation in the raw gene read count in liver than in cortex (S6 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the DE between the sleep-deprived and control conditions, we used the R package limma [115] with the voom weighting function followed by the limma empirical Bayes method [116].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-seq data are deposited in NCBI GEO (accession code GSE114845).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The RNA-seq dataset was also used to complement the publicly available GeneNetwork genetic map (www.genenetwork.org), thus increasing its resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-seq variant calling was performed using the Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK) from the Broad Institute, using the recommended workflow for RNA-seq data [117].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To improve coverage depth, 2 additional RNA-seq datasets from other projects using the same BXD lines were added [111].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 6 BXD datasets from 4 different tissues (cortex, hypothalamus, brainstem, and liver) were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hard filtering procedure was applied as suggested by the GATK pipeline [117119].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, genotypes with more than 10% missing information, low quality (less_than5,000), and redundant information were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GeneNetwork genotypes, which were discrepant with our RNA-seq experiment, were tagged as unknown (mean of 1% of the GeneNetwork genotypes/strain [0.05%  n  8%]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, GeneNetwork and our RNA-seq genotypes were merged into a unique set of around 11,000 genotypes, which was used for all subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This set of genotypes was already used successfully in a previous study of BXD lines [111] and is available through our Swiss-BXD web interface (https://bxd.vital-it.ch; Downloads, Genotypes.GeneNetwork2005AndRNAseq.geno).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although overall, a close to 50/50 balance between B6 and D2 genotypes was observed across the genome, a minority of sites displayed a strong imbalance toward either genotype (S7 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed a minor but general trend toward more D2 than B6 genotypes per strain (S7 Fig), which was also found in the GeneNetwork genotypes for the BXD strains used in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

QTL_mapping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The R package qtl/r [120] was used for interval mapping of behavioral/EEG phenotypes (phQTLs) and metabolites (mQTLs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pseudomarkers were imputed every cM, and genome-wide associations were calculated using the Expected-Maximization (EM) algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p-values were corrected for FDR using permutation tests with 1,000 random shuffles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance threshold was set to 0.05 FDR, a suggestive threshold to 0.63 FDR, and a highly suggestive threshold to 0.10 FDR according to [28,29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QTL boundaries were determined using a 1.5 LOD support interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To preserve sensitivity in QTL detection, we did not apply further p-value correction for the many phenotypes tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effect size of single QTLs was estimated using 2 methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Method 1 does not consider eventual other QTLs present and computes effect size according to 1  10^((2/n)*LOD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Method 2 does consider multi-QTL effects and computes effect size by each contributing QTL by calculating first the full, additive model for all QTLs identified and, subsequently, estimating the effects of each contributing QTL by computing the variance lost when removing that QTL from the full model (drop-one-term analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Method 2, the additive effect of multiple suggestive, highly suggestive, and significant QTLs was calculated using the fitqtl function of the qtl/r package [121].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this method, the sum of single QTL effect estimation can be lower than the full model because of association between genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Results section, Method 1 was used to estimate effect size, unless specified otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that the effect size estimated for a QTL represents the variance explained of the genetic portion of the variance (between-strain variability) quantified as heritability and not of the total variance observed for a given phenotype (i.e., within- plus between-strain variability).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For detection of eQTLs, cis-eQTLs were mapped using FastQTL [122] within a 2 Mb window for which adjusted p-values were computed with 1,000 permutations and beta distribution fitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The R package qvalue [123] was then used for multiple-testing correction as proposed by [122].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the q-values are reported for each cis-eQTL in the text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trans-eQTL detection was performed using a modified version of FastEpistasis [124], on several million associations (approximately 15,000 genes × 11,000 markers), applying a global, hard p-value threshold of 1E4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_damage_prediction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Variants detected by our RNA-seq variant calling were annotated using Annovar [125] with the RefSeq annotation dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonsynonymous variations were further investigated for protein disruption using Polyphen-2 version 2.2.2 [126], which was adapted for use in the mouse according to recommended configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hiveplot_visualization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hiveplots were constructed with the R package HiveR [25] for each phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression and metabolite levels represented in the hiveplots come from either the Ctr (control) or SD molecular datasets according to the phenotype represented in the hiveplot; i.e., the Ctr dataset is represented for phenotypes related to the baseline (bsl) condition, while the SD dataset is shown for phenotypes related to recovery (rec and rec/bsl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a given hiveplot, only those genes and metabolites were included (depicted as nodes on the axes) for which the Pearson correlation coefficient between the phenotype concerned and the molecule passed a data-driven threshold set to the top 0.5% of all absolute correlations between all phenotypes on the one hand and all molecular (gene expression and metabolites) on the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This threshold was calculated separately for Bsl phenotypes and for Rec and Rec/Bsl phenotypes and amounted to absolute correlation thresholds of 0.510 and 0.485, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter was used for the recovery phenotypes in Results Examples 14 and for the printed hiveplots (other thresholds can be chosen in the interactive website https://bxd.vital-it.ch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross-associations between genes and metabolites represented by the edges in the hiveplot were filtered using quantile thresholds (top 0.05% genegene associations, top 0.5% genemetabolite associations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We corrected for cis-eQTL confounding effects by computing partial correlations between all possible pairs of genes (see Results and Fig 4B and 4C for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Candidate-gene_prioritization_strategy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to prioritize genes in identified QTL regions, we chose to combine the results of the following analyses: (i) QTL mapping (phQTL or mQTL, Fig 2C), (ii) correlation analysis, (iii) expression QTL (eQTL, Fig 2B), (iv) protein damagingvariation prediction, and (v) DE (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each result was transformed into an analysis score using a min/max normalization, in which the contribution of extreme values was reduced by a winsorization of the results (S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analysis scores were first associated with each gene (see below) and then integrated into a single "integrated score" computed separately for each tissue, yielding 1 integrated score in cortex and 1 in liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation analysis score, eQTL score, DE score, and protein damagingvariation score are already associated to genes, and these values were therefore simply attributed to the corresponding gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To associate a gene with the ph-/mQTL analysis score (which is associated to markers), we used the central position of the gene to infer the associated ph-/mQTL analysis score at that position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of a cis-eQTL linked to a gene or a damaging variation within the gene, we used the position of the associated marker instead (S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To emphasize diversity and reduce analysis score information redundancy, we weighted each analysis score using the Henikoff algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The individual scores were discretized before using the Henikoff algorithm, which was applied on all the genes within the ph-/mQTL region associated with each phenotype (S4 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrated score (formula in Fig 4D) was calculated separately for cortex and liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a 10,000-permutation procedure to compute an FDR for the integrated scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each permutation procedure, all 5 analysis scores were permutated, and a novel integrated score was computed again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximal integrated score for each permutation procedure was kept, and a significance threshold was set at quantile 95.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying the Henikoff weighting improved the sensitivity of the gene prioritization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E.g., among the 91 behavioral/EEG phenotypes quantified with 1 or more suggestive/significant QTL after SD, 40 had at least 1 gene significantly prioritized with Henikoff weighting, against 32 without.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of analysis scores and weight can be found in S1 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

S2_Fig_Relatedness_among_EEG_and_behavioral_phenotypes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the relationship among phenotypes and to identify unique phenotype modules, we cross-correlated all 341 phenotypes using Spearman correlations followed by hierarchical clustering (average linkage).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting dendrogram was cut at a height of 0.3, thereby defining 120 modules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotypes belonging to the same module but not to the same (sub-) category were counted separately, yielding 148 distinct phenotypic modules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modules are represented by node color, and phenotype categories by node shape (see Fig 2A and Materials and methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Edges were filtered for top correlation (|s|  0.7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three superclusters (Supercluster IIII) grouping several modules were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 4 recovery phenotypes discussed in Results section (Examples 14) are marked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EEG, electroencephalography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

S4_Fig_Gene_prioritization_strategy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(A) Five analysis scores (right; see Fig 3, main text, and Materials and methods) are derived from the actual statistics (left) for (i) ph-/mQTL FDR-adjusted p-value, (ii) eQTL q-value, (iii) genetic variant annotation, (iv) Pearson correlation p-value, and (v) DE FDR-adjusted p-value (from top to bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compute a single gene variant score, we sum the following values for each gene and for each detected variant: splicing = 10; stop-gain = 10; stop-loss = 10; frameshift indel = 10; nonsynonymous = 10 * polyphen2-probability value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) We used the central position of the gene to infer the associated ph-/mQTL analysis score at that position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in cases where the associated cis-eQTL score or the damaging gene variant score gave a higher value than the ph-/mQTL score, the position of the relevant associated marker was used instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A case of the former is illustrated with the gene Naa30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gene is located near a recombinant region with the central gene position (green arrow) located in a low ph-/mQTL associated region, while the cis-eQTL-associated marker (red arrow) is located in a highly associated ph-/mQTL region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Naa30, its associated cis-eQTL score was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Henikoff weighted scores computed for each phenotype after sleep deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black line at 0.2 represents the line of equality among the 5 scores (summed weight = 1.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ph-/mQTL scores generally have higher weights than the other 4 scores because it is the only non-transcript-derived score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other scores are based in part on the RNA-seq data, and the Henikoff lowers their respective weights because of this dependency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DE, differential expression; eQTL, expression quantitative trait locus; FDR, false discovery rate; ph-/mQTL, phenotypic/metabolic quantitative trait locus; RNA-seq, RNA sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#
