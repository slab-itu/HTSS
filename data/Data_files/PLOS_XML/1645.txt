Anti-cancer stem cell activity of a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Ambrosia arborescens and of a synthetic derivative  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
New regimens are constantly being pursued in cancer treatment, especially in the context of treatment-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are assumed to be involved in cancer recurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we investigated the anti-cancer activity of sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) isolated from Ambrosia arborescens and of synthetic derivatives in breast cancer cell lines, with a specific focus on activity against CSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, JIMT-1, and HCC1937 and the normal-like breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A were treated with the SLs damsin and coronopilin, isolated from A. arborescens, and with ambrosin and dindol-01, synthesized using damsin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) values were obtained from dose-response curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on IC50 values, doses in the M range were used for investigating effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle phase distribution, cell death, micronuclei formation, and cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis was used to investigate proteins involved in cell cycle regulation as well as in the NF-B pathway since SLs have been shown to inhibit this transcription factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific CSC effects were investigated using three CSC assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All compounds inhibited cell proliferation; however, damsin and ambrosin were toxic at single-digit micromolar ranges, while higher concentrations were required for coronopilin and dindol-01.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the four cell lines, the compounds had the least effect on the normal-like MCF-10A cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibition of cell proliferation can partly be explained by downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All compounds inhibited tumour necrosis factor--induced translocation of NF-B from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Damsin and ambrosin treatment increased the number of micronuclei; moreover, another sign of DNA damage was the increased level of p53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with damsin and ambrosin decreased the CSC subpopulation and inhibited cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that these compounds should be further investigated to find efficient CSC-inhibiting compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The major cause for cancer mortality is the recurrence of treatment-resistant cancer cells found locally or as metastases at distant organ sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conventional treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and irradiation apparently do not obliterate all cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current research shows that a tumour is an hierarchical organization of cells with different phenotypes and genotypes [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the top of the cancer cell hierarchy is the proposed cancer stem cell (CSC) [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CSC has the main properties of a normal stem cell, i.e., self-renewal and differentiation [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, similar to a normal stem cell, CSCs appear to have an increased survival capacity towards different types of damage caused by chemical and physical insults [4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The targeting of the small population of CSCs may lie at the centre of identifying a cure for cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CSCs were first identified in leukaemia [4] but have henceforth been found in solid tumours [5] and in cancer cell lines derived from different organs [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CSCs are identified based on cell surface and intracellular markers [6] and functional capacities, such as tumour formation in immunocompromised animals [7] or colony formation under serum-free conditions in vitro [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a growing interest in finding compounds that lead to the development of new drugs and can be used in the clinic to target CSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study focused on sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) isolated from Ambrosia arborescens, a plant used in traditional medicine in many South American countries [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SLs are a group of secondary metabolites found across the plant kingdom [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A feature of SLs is the presence of an -methylene--lactone ring, resulting in a high alkylating ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these molecules are thought to act by alkylating nucleophiles in the cell, namely, proteins containing sulfhydryl groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One specific target suggested for SLs is p65, one of the members of the heterodimeric transcription factor NF-B, which regulates a broad range of biological activities such as immune responses, development, survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis [11] [12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on the SLs damsin and coronopilin isolated from A. arborescens [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we included the two compounds ambrosin and dindol-01, which were synthesized from the isolated damsin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We initially found that all compounds inhibited tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-)-induced translocation of NF-B to the cell nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dose response assays showed that all compounds were cytotoxic to the breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, JIMT-1, and HCC1937) as well as to the MCF-10A normal-like breast epithelial cell line; however, the latter cell line was least affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most toxic compound was ambrosin, which was also found to reduce the CSC subpopulation of the JIMT-1 cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compounds_and_stock_solutions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The natural sesquiterpene lactones used in this study, damsin and coronopilin, were isolated from A. arborescens [14] (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ambrosin and dindol-01 were semi-synthesized from damsin [14] (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO as a 100 mM stock solution, which was stored at -20°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compounds were then diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 8 g/l NaCl, 0.2 g/L KCl, 1.15 g/l Na2HPO4, 0.2 g/l KH2PO4, pH 7.3) to prepare the working solutions at the appropriate concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The controls were supplemented with PBS containing DMSO at the same concentrations as the working solutions of the compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final DMSO concentration was equal to or less than 0.1% in all assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_lines_and_culture_conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (HTB-22) and HCC1937 (CRL-2336) as well as the human normal-like breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (CRL-10317) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MCF-7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS) (VWR, Lund, Sweden), 1 mM non-essential amino acids (VWR), 10 g/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden), and 100 U/ml penicillin/100 g/ml streptomycin (VWR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MCF-10A cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (VWR) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (VWR), 1 mM non-essential amino acids (VWR), 10 g/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich), 250 ng/ml hydrocortisol (Sigma-Aldrich), and 100 U/ml penicillin/100 g/ml streptomycin (VWR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HCC1937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (VWR) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (VWR), 1 mM non-essential amino acids (VWR), 10 g/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 U/ml penicillin/100 g/ml streptomycin (VWR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human breast carcinoma cell line JIMT-1 (ACC589) was purchased from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) and routinely cultured in DMEM/Hams F-12 medium (VWR) supplemented with 10% FCS (VWR), 1 mM non-essential amino acids (VWR), 10 mg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 100 U/ml penicillin/100 g/ml streptomycin (VWR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All cell lines were kept at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the experiments, cells were seeded at the following densities: MCF-10A: 104 cells/cm2, MCF-7: 2×104 cells/cm2, HCC1937: 2×104 cells/cm2 and JIMT-1: 1.5×104 cells/cm2, in tissue culture vessels of the appropriate size to obtain the desired cell number for the different assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume of medium used was 0.20.3 ml per cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were allowed to attach for 24 hours before the addition of the compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MTT_assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the MTT assay, cells were detached by trypsinization and counted in a haemocytometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then seeded into 96-well plates at a density described above in 180 l medium per well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-four hours after incubation in the CO2 incubator, the compounds were added to a final concentration 0.1, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 M. At 72 hours following drug treatment, 20 l of MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well, and the 96-well plates were returned to the CO2 incubator for 1 hour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blue formazan product, formed by reduction in live attached cells, was dissolved by adding 100 l of 100% DMSO per well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plates were gently swirled at room temperature for 10 minutes to dissolve the precipitate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absorbance was monitored at 540 nm using a Labsystems iEMS Reader MF (Labsystems Oy, Helsinki, Finland) and the software DeltaSoft II v.4.14 (Biometallics Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dose-response curves and IC50 values were obtained using GraphPad Prism software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least 3 dose-response experiments were performed for each compound, and the mean IC50 ± SD was calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inhibition_of_TNF--induced_translocation_of_p65_NF-B_to_the_nucleus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Round glass cover slips (13 mm diameter) were placed in 12-well plates, and JIMT-1 or MCF-7 cells (0.1 × 106) were seeded in the wells in complete medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 12-well plates were incubated for 24 hours to allow attachment of the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cover slips were transferred to new 12-well plates, and 800 l medium supplemented with 0.1% FCS was added to each well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were treated with the compounds at IC50 for 60 minutes in the incubator, and then, TNF- (25 ng/ml) was added to each well and incubation was continued for another 40 minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the cells were fixed with 2 ml of 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at 4°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To block nonspecific binding sites and to permeabilize the cells, the samples were incubated with blocking/permeabilization buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 1% Tween 20 in PBS) at room temperature for 1 hour and then washed twice with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-p65/NF-B (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) (diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer), and incubation was continued for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by washing and incubation with Alexa 488 anti-rabbit-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, USA) diluted 1:900 in blocking buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, the cover slips were mounted onto glass slides in 10 l Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich) and kept in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were viewed on an Olympus/Nikon epifluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Japan), and images were taken with a digital camera (Nikon Imaging Japan Inc., Japan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The localization of p65/NF-B was also investigated in cells treated for 72 hours with a 5 M concentration of the compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were fixed, labelled, and imaged as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Growth_curves_and_sampling_for_flow_cytometric_analysis_of_cell_cycle_phase_distribution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were seeded at the density described above and incubated for 24 hours before the addition of the appropriate compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compounds were added to the final concentrations of 1, 2.5, or 5 M. Cells were sampled every 24 hours for 96 hours for cell counting and then pelleted and fixed in 70% ethanol for flow cytometric evaluation of cell cycle phase distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_cell_cycle_phase_distribution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cells fixed in 70% ethanol were washed once with PBS, and after pelleting, the cells were resuspended in propidium iodide (PI)-nuclear isolation medium (PBS containing 100 g/ml PI (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.6% NP-40, and 100 g/ml ribonuclease A (Sigma-Aldrich)) for at least 30 minutes at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were analysed using a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were analysed using MultiCycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Wound-healing_assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The wound-healing assay was performed as described by Huang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compounds were added to the final concentrations of 1 or 5 M. The maximal DMSO concentration used was 0.001%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_blot_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were seeded at the density described above and incubated for 24 hours before the addition of the compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compounds were added to the final concentrations of 1, 2.5, or 5 M. After 72 hours of treatment, cells were sampled for cell counting and then pelleted; the dry pellets were stored at -80°C before Western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellets were diluted in sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5% -mercaptoethanol, 1% NP-40; 100,000 cells/15 l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were sonicated twice for 20 seconds each, boiled for 7 minutes and stored at -20°C until further application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pre-cast polyacrylamide gels (412% acrylamide Bis-Tris) were loaded with 15 l of prepared samples per lane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gel electrophoresis was performed in an XCell Surelock Mini-Cell electrophoresis system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Stockholm, Sweden) at 150 V for 90 minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using an iBlot Dry Blotting System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with primary antibodies against p53 (BD Biosciences, Stockholm, Sweden, 554294), p21 (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany, sc-6246), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) (Santa Cruz), cyclin D1 (BD Biosciences, 554180), total p65 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, ab76311), total IB (Abcam, ab7217), phosphorylated IB (pIB, Abcam, ab12135), and -actin (Abcam).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at room temperature, the membranes were exposed to enhanced chemiluminescent solution (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) to detect the protein bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were collected and analysed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensities of the bands were determined by densitometric scanning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_surface_markers_identified_by_flow_cytometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identification of cell surface markers was performed as described by Huang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compounds were added to the final concentrations of 1, 2.5, or 5 M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ALDEFLUOR_assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
JIMT-1 cells were seeded at the density described above and incubated for 24 hours before the addition of the compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compounds were added to the final concentrations of 1, 2.5, or 5 M. The ALDEFLUOR kit (Stem Cell Technologies, Grenoble, France) was used according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were harvested by Accutase treatment and kept on ice; after cell counting, two test tubes (200,000 cells in each tube) with assay buffer were prepared for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the test tubes was used as a negative control receiving the specific ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the ALDH substrate BODIPY-aminoacetaldehyde was added to both tubes, which were incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in 500 l assay buffer before analysis using the BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DEAB-treated cells served as a control to set the ALDH+ region for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CFlow software was used to evaluate the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Micronuclei_as_a_measure_of_DNA_double-strand_breaks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were seeded onto glass cover slips at the densities described above and incubated for 24 hours before the addition of the compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compounds were added to the final concentrations of 2.5 or 5 M. After fixation with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes and subsequent washing in PBS, the cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 1% Tween 20 and 1% FCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were stained with bisbenzimide (1 g/l in PBS) for 2 minutes and finally washed with PBS before mounting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were viewed on an Olympus/Nikon epifluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Japan), and images were taken with a digital camera (Nikon Imaging Japan Inc., Japan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each slide was imaged at randomly chosen areas using 100x and 40x objectives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence of all the images was analysed using ImageJ software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Colony_formation_assay_in_soft_agar  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
JIMT-1 cells were seeded at the density described above and incubated for 24 hours before the addition of the compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compounds were added to the final concentrations of 1, 2.5, or 5 M. After 72 hours of incubation with the different treatments, the cells were harvested using Accutase for 10 minutes at 37°C and then kept on ice during cell counting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mammary epithelial basal medium (CC-4136 kit) (Cambrex, Walkersville, Maryland, USA), supplemented with hydrocortisone, insulin, and EGF (all from the CC-4136 kit) as well as with B27 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific), basic fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/ml) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml), was heated to 42°C and mixed with agar to a final concentration of 0.4%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the cell suspension was added to a concentration of 1000 cells/ml, followed by immediate addition of 500 l of this mixture to the inner wells of hydrophobic 48-well plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize evaporation, the outer wells were filled with 1 ml PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plates were wrapped in saran wrap and incubated in 5% CO2 in humidified air at 37°C for 14 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colonies were counted manually using an inverted phase-contrast microscope using a 10x objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analysed by one-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak multiple comparison test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 95% confidence interval in the multiple comparisons was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inhibition_of_TNF--induced_NF-B_translocation_to_the_nucleus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SLs have been shown to exert their effects by interfering with the NF-B pathway by binding to p65 [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we decided to investigate whether the compounds were indeed active in inhibiting TNF--induced NF-B translocation to the nucleus using immunofluorescence microscopy after labelling with antibodies against p65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our hypothesis was that if the compounds bound p65, they would inhibit the translocation of the NF-B complex to the nucleus [16].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this initial assay to assess activity, we chose the 5 M concentration based on previous reports of toxicity [17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNF- treatment alone induced the translocation of p65/NF-B to the nucleus; however, the translocation was inhibited by a 1-hour pretreatment period with a 5 M concentration of all compounds (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dose-response_assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After confirming the compounds were active, we performed dose-response testing using an MTT assay to obtain an overall view of toxicity of the compounds in the breast-derived cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 1 shows the IC50 values obtained after treating the cells lines for 72 hours with the different compounds (dose-response curves in S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the four compounds, damsin and ambrosin were the most toxic, with the latter being somewhat more toxic than the former (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IC50 values of coronopilin and dindol-01 were approximately two times or more as high as those of damsin and ambrosin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inhibition_of_cell_proliferation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the dose-response curves, we performed a kinetic investigation of the inhibition of cell proliferation after treatment with the most toxic compounds, damsin and ambrosin, in the four cell lines (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were seeded, and 24 hours later, the compounds were added to the final concentrations of 1, 2.5, or 5 M to cover a range of inhibitory responses in all cell lines; the cell number was determined every 24 hours for a total of 72 hours of treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were used to construct growth curves, which showed dose- and time-response effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ambrosin was more toxic in all cell lines compared to damsin (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with a 5 M concentration of ambrosin resulted in complete inhibition of cell proliferation already 24 hours after addition of the compound in all cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Altered_cell_cycle_phase_distribution_and_induced_cell_death  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA histograms were used to investigate the effects on the cell cycle phase distribution and if cell death was induced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, after cell counting, the cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with PI, and the cell cycle phase distribution was evaluated by flow cytometry (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with 1 M and 2.5 M damsin had no clear effect on the cell cycle phase distribution (Fig 4A4D), while treatment with 5 M resulted in increased S and/or G2 phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ambrosin treatment resulted in an apparent increase in the S and G2 phases and at a lower concentration compared to damsin (Fig 4I4L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell cycle phase distribution was more affected in the JIMT-1 cell line than in the other cell lines, especially by ambrosin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When cells death occurs by either apoptosis or necrosis, the DNA content is reduced by various mechanisms, and the nuclei/parts of nuclei appeared in the sub-G1 region (% debris).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different cell lines had different degrees of spontaneous cell death (see the control in Fig 3E3H and Fig 4M4P).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Damsin treatment did not result in any major difference in the sub-G1 region compared to the control (Fig 4E4H), except in MCF-7 cells at a 5 M concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ambrosin treatment increased cell death in all cell lines, especially at a 5 M concentration (Fig 4M4P).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_on_proteins_involved_in_cell_cycle_regulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain an understanding of the possible mechanisms involved in the inhibition of cell proliferation, we investigated proteins involved in cell cycle regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyclin D1 and CDK2, which are important for G1 phase progression and S phase transition, respectively, were investigated in JIMT-1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5 shows that the level of cyclin D1 increased in JIMT-1 cells treated for 72 hours with 1 M damsin; however, treatment with 5 M damsin or 1 and 5 M ambrosin had no effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, CDK2 was downregulated by treatment with both damsin and ambrosin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tumour suppressor p53 has a regulatory role in the transition from G1 to S phase by upregulating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in response to DNA damage and oxidative stress [18] and in the regulation of G2/M transition [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a trend towards increased expression of p53 in MCF-7 and JIMT-1 cells treated with damsin and ambrosin (Fig 5A and 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MCF-7 cells containing wild-type p53, there was a trend towards increased p21 (Fig 5B), while p21 was not detected in JIMT-1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is in agreement with the p53 protein in JIMT-1 cells containing a point mutation and thus preventing its action as a transcription factor for p21 [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Formation_of_micronuclei_by_treatment_with_damsin_and_ambrosin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since there was a trend towards increased p53 expression, and p53 has been connected to DNA damage, we analysed micronuclei in cells after treatment with damsin and ambrosin (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MCF-10A cells, only ambrosin treatment resulted in increased formation of micronuclei (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both compounds increased the micronuclei in MCF-7 and JIMT-1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ambrosin treatment resulted in the formation of more nuclei than damsin treatment (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of micronuclei largely reflects the sub-G1 region (compare Figs 4 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effects_on_the_protein_levels_of_NF-B_and_IB  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After 72 hours of treatment with a 5 M concentration of the compounds, we could not see any difference in the localization of NF-B compared to control cells, as evaluated using immunofluorescence microscopy, and NF-B was found mainly in the cytoplasm (not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain a better estimate of the levels of inactive (non-phosphorylated p65/NF-B) and active (phosphorylated p65/NF-B), we performed a Western blot analysis of the proteins in MCF-7 and JIMT-1 cells (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also investigated the level of the NF-B inhibiting protein IB (total level) as well as of its phosphorylated form, i.e., pIB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There was a trend towards increased total level of p65 in MCF7 and JIMT-1 cells after treatment with damsin or ambrosin (Fig 7A and 7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphorylated form of p65 was not detected in any Western blots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding the NF-B inhibitor IB and its phosphorylated form, pIB, there was a trend towards increased total levels in JIMT-1 cells (Fig 7F and 7G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MCF-7 cells, there was a trend towards increased IB in treated cells (Fig 6B), while the level of the phosphorylated form of the protein was unchanged apart from treatment with 5 M ambrosin, which resulted in a significant decrease (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data imply that there was a decrease in the proportion of phosphorylated IB in cells treated with ambrosin and damsin, implying that the NF-B heterodimer was partly inhibited from entering the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effects_on_cancer_stem_cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CSCs are thought to be at the top of a hierarchical cancer cell organization, and thus, eliminating these cells may result in a higher probability of curing cancer [21].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate CSC specific effects, we used three assays that are presumed to reflect changes in this subpopulation (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high expression of CD44 paired with absent/low expression of CD24 on the cell surface has been used as a CSC marker in breast tumours [22] (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another marker of breast CSCs is increased ALDH activity [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colony forming efficiency in serum free soft agar is a functional assay, which has been used to investigate the survival of cells with stem cell properties [24] (Fig 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with 5 M ambrosin decreased the CSC population by more than 50% in all assays (Fig 8), while treatment with 5 M damsin had a lower effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inhibition_of_cell_migration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cancer cells, specifically CSCs, are endowed with the property of migration, which gives rise to distant metastases [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, drugs that can inhibit this process are desirable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The JIMT-1 cell line was used to investigate the effect on cell migration of damsin and ambrosin using a wound-healing assay (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell migration was inhibited by treatment with either compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SLs have been considered in cancer treatment for quite a while because of their chemical properties and biological activities [26].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SLs are, in fact, a large group of compounds that can be categorized into several smaller groups based on the carbocyclic skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four compounds used in this study belong to the pseudoguanolides group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The toxicities of damsin, ambrosin, and coronopilin have been investigated previously, while dindol-01 is a new SL in biological studies [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, we found that damsin and ambrosin were more toxic than coronopilin and dindol-01, and thus, we used these two former compounds for more extensive investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in a study with CaCo-2 colon cancer cells, coronopilin was shown to exhibit somewhat higher toxicity than damsin, but the concentrations used (25100 M) were much higher than in the present study [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The toxicity of ambrosin and damsin was investigated in a number of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cell lines [28].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IC50 values for ambrosin and damsin were similar in the previous study, and in general, higher IC50 values were obtained compared to those in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are many causes for differences in IC50 values of the same compounds between different studies, and one obvious difference is the cell lines used and culture conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To the best of our knowledge, no extensive studies of the effects of these compounds on cell proliferation kinetics have been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show the kinetics of inhibition of cell proliferation in growth curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, increasing the concentrations of a compound showed increasing effects on cell proliferation kinetics, and this trend was clear for the doses chosen for ambrosin in all cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, regarding damsin, this trend was clear for the breast cancer cell lines, while it was less obvious for the MCF-10A cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, it is beneficial to find that normal cells are not affected at a dose where cancer cells are affected; however, general conclusions regarding differences between cancer cells and normal cells cannot be drawn on the basis of data from one normal-like cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ambrosin did not display this difference in inhibition of cell proliferation between MCF-10A and the breast cancer cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When cell proliferation is inhibited by treatment with toxic compounds, it may result in changes in cell cycle phase distribution as a reflection of which cell cycle phases are affected [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Damsin and ambrosin treatment resulted in an increased fraction of cells in S and G2 phases, which suggests the induction of DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That DNA damage was indeed induced as was demonstrated by an increased number of micronuclei and a tendency to increased p53, a DNA damage response protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A study using the SLs costunolide and dehydrocostus lactone also showed the induction of DNA damage, which arrested the cells at the G2/M interface [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That study corroborated the block with decreased expression of CDK2, which we also found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the study mentioned above comparing the toxicity of damsin and ambrosin in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines, the cells were found to express mutated p53 and were sensitive to damsin but not to ambrosin [19].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is in contrast to our study where we found that all cell lines were more sensitive to ambrosin independent of p53 status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells have wild-type p53, while JIMT-1 and HCC1937 have mutated p53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SLs have been shown to inhibit the NF-B pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B is a transcription factor that is regulated by its localization [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When inactive, NF-B is sequestered in the cytoplasm by association with IB proteins; however, when activated by various signals, NF-B is released from the inhibitor and translocates to the nucleus to activate gene transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNF- is an activator of NF-B, and we used this cytokine to show that all four SLs were indeed active at a 5 M concentration in acute experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis of proteins involved in this pathway showed only slight changes after 72 hours of treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NF-B has been shown to be important for CSCs [32], and we found a reduction of the CSC subpopulation of the JIMT-1 cell line using three different assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found an inhibition of cell migration, which can also be a result of a reduced CSC population, as CSCs potentially possess mesenchymal traits and contribute to cancer metastases [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the most important information obtained from this study is the effect on the CSC population and on cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CSCs have been identified in almost all solid tumours and have been suggested to be responsible for cancer treatment failure, as CSCs display resistance to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, CSCs are an obvious target in the search for more efficient anti-cancer drugs that alone or in various combinations can eradicate all cancer cells of a tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that SLs should be further exploited regarding anti-CSC activity through rational design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
