A Validated Multiscale In-Silico Model for Mechano-sensitive Tumour Angiogenesis and Growth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vascularisation is a key feature of cancer growth, invasion and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand the governing biophysical processes and their relative importance, it is instructive to develop physiologically representative mathematical models with which to compare to experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have successfully applied this approach to test the effect of various biochemical factors on tumour growth and angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these models do not account for the experimentally observed dependency of angiogenic network evolution on growth-induced solid stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work introduces two novel features: the effects of hapto- and mechanotaxis on vessel sprouting, and mechano-sensitive dynamic vascular remodelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed three-dimensional, multiscale, in-silico model of dynamically coupled angiogenic tumour growth is specified to in-vivo and in-vitro data, chosen, where possible, to provide a physiologically consistent description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model is then validated against in-vivo data from murine mammary carcinomas, with particular focus placed on identifying the influence of mechanical factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crucially, we find that it is necessary to include hapto- and mechanotaxis to recapitulate observed time-varying spatial distributions of angiogenic vasculature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Author_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Angiogenesis is a hallmark of tumour growth and a key feature for invasion and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to elucidate the governing biological processes of cancer development, it is instructive to develop physiologically representative mathematical and computational (in-silico) models with which to compare to experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present a validated, three-dimensional, in-silico model of tumour-induced angiogenesis and growthunique in the field of mathematical cancer modelling in its biophysical prescription and predictive accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our novel modelling approach encompasses the effects of both biochemical and biomechanical processes on the development of angiogenic vasculature and solid tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike other workswhich typically focus on biochemical processesour model depicts a dynamic and coupled biophysical system of the tumour-host microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In concert with in-vivo experimental data, we have a physiologically-representative in-silico model that enables us to classify and rank the governing biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This yielded the remarkable discovery that it is necessary to include biomechanical factors to accurately describe angiogenic topology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model not only provides insight into fundamental cancer biophysics, but is also a powerful tool to aid in our overall objective of re-engineering the tumour microenvironment to optimise the delivery of therapeutic drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The role of angiogenesisthe process whereby existing blood vessels produce new vasculaturein cancerous growth, invasion and metastasis has been extensively studied over the past five decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting with the assertion of Folkman [1] that angiogenesis is a necessary component for neoplasmic growth, the current paradigm is that tumours induce neo-vascularisation upon reaching an avascular limit [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This limit represents a critical tumour size that can be supported by oxygen diffusion from the existing vasculature alone, beyond which substrate gradients produce internal regions of oxygen deprivation, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To avoid necrosis, cells in the hypoxic regions secrete diffusible chemical signals, termed tumour angiogenic growth factors (TAFs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon reaching the existing vasculature, the TAFs stimulate endothelial cells (ECs) to degrade their basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM) via the secretion of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motile ECs then migrate from the vessel lining up the TAF gradient field towards the TAF source, forming tubes with sprout-tips at the leading edge of a new vascular lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tubes can form networks in a process termed anastomosis and penetrate into the tumour, depending on how the ECs respond to mechano-chemical factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As blood flows through the vessels and remodels their structure through its response to fluid shear stresses and vascular pressure, the tumour is provided with a direct supply of nutrients and oxygen, enabling further expansion into the surrounding tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neo-vasculature, however, is pathological and during tumour growth its structural integrity can be compromised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed solid stresses in the tumour are elevated as a consequence of rapid growth into the confined space of the host tissue, which can compress and ultimately collapse intra-tumoural blood vessels, rendering tumours hypo-vascular and hypo-perfused [3, 4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypo-perfusion, in turn, has been shown to inhibit the delivery of chemotherapy, reducing drastically treatment efficacy [5, 6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, a key factor in angiogenic tumour growth is cell response to mechano-chemical cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular interest is their directed motion along chemical gradients, termed chemotaxis and haptotaxis for soluble (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oxygen) and insoluble (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  proteoglycan) substrates, respectively, and mechanical gradients (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  solid stresses), termed mechanotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This produces a biophysical system with multiple components interacting at multiple scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to study the effect of a given component and characterise its physical origins, it is instructive to construct physiologically-representative mathematical models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we focus on continuum models of tumour growth coupled with angiogenesis; for more detail on angiogenesis modelling alone, see the recent review by Scianna et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas previous studies have explored the chemical, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  solute-driven, underpinning of both tumour growth and angiogenesis, here we focus on the interplay between angiogenic network evolution and growth-induced solid stress generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Broadly speaking, the tumour and vasculature can each be described by continuum, discrete or hybrid models, with their coupling either static or dynamic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One approach is to characterise the angiogenic response in terms of the blood vessel density, with the dynamics and chemical factors obeying continuum conservation laws.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prominent early examples are [8, 9], which extended the seminal work of Balding and McElwain [10] to define a set of coupled integro-differential equations that characterise tumour-induced neo-vascularisation and network formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently in [11], the authors utilised a continuum approach to investigate the role of feedback regulation processes on sprout inception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the blood vessel density paradigm is unable to account for vascular morphology and its explicit impact on blood flow heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to characterise network morphology and blood flow, it is necessary to model the vasculature discretely in terms of line segments, curves or lattices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach was adopted by Zheng et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [12], who employed a hybrid model to describe the vasculature [13] coupled with a nonlinear continuum description of the tumour mass [14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model simulated physiologically-realistic tumour morphologies as a result of a static coupling with angiogenic growth, but was limited in its description of tumour-environment interactions and mechanical factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model was later extended by Macklin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [15] to include dynamic angiogenesis, allowing for an explicit description of vascular remodelling and blood flow, and further extended by Wu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [16] to model the effects of interstitial fluid pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A contrasting approach was proposed by [17], who presented a solid mechanics description of the tumour and its environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their model featured a dynamic coupling of angiogenesis and vascular remodelling with a growing domain, and accounted for deformation due to growth, response to hypoxia and blood flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was no account of the effect of solid stress on vascular development and integrity inside the tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To account for the effect of haptotactic (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  insoluble) vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), Milde et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [18] presented a deterministic, hybrid model of sprouting angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The matrix-bound VEGF was cleaved by MMPs produced at the endothelial tip cells, and the response characterised in terms of the resulting vessel geometries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, they included the effect of ECM fibre density and structure on the sprout tip migration velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They found that high density matrices produced shorter capillary networks, and observed an increase in the number of branches with the density of matrix-bound VEGF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained by Bauer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [19], who developed a cell-based model of tumour-induced angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both models, however, there was no account of mechanotaxis or the effects of vessel wall collapse due to applied solid stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies by Breward et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [20] and Bartha et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [21] have presented models describing the effect of pressure on vessel integrity, but no attempt is made to explicitly model vessel compression owing to intratumoural forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To our knowledge there is no existing model that dynamically couples capillary growth, morphology and structure with mechanochemically-regulated blood flow and growth-induced solid stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerical simulations of angiogenic tumour growth are performed for spheroidal geometries, which we use to gain insight into the relationship between mechano-chemical factors and tumour development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Key measures of vascular development, defined in the following section, are validated using data from in-vivo murine mammary carcinomas [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypotheses we test are:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One part of the novelty of the mathematical formulation lies in the introduction of a mechanotactic term to the function defining the orientation of capillary tip elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second part is the use of a phenomenological description of the tip extension velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final part is a set of constitutive terms defining the capillary wall remodelling as a function of mechanical factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features furnish the model with a complete, if simplified, description of the biophysical factors influencing tumour-induced angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specifically, a discrete three-dimensional model of vascular sprouting is employed to describe the angiogenic response to TAF secretion, where the sprout-tips are represented as point masses in a continuum substratum [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secretion of TAFs and MMPs by the tumour and vasculature, respectively, are described by coupled reaction-diffusion equations [24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumour growth is modelled according to a Gompertz-type relation derived in previous work [25], and the quasi-static linear momentum equation is solved at the macroscopic scale assuming hyperelastic material properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Capillary elongation, branching and remodelling are made dependent upon mechanical factors, such as traction and magnitude of wall shear stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, similar to Stylianopoulos and Jain [26], intra-, trans- and extravascular fluid flow is described by Poiseuilles, Starlings and Darcys laws respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, we present here for the first time a validated, three-dimensional, tumour-induced angiogenesis model using published in-vivo data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data include the vascular density and structure obtained from image analysis of MCaIV carcinomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To constrain the model, ex-vivo measurements of MCaIV carcinoma material properties were used as input parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where possible all other input parameters were specified according to either in-vivo or in-vitro data from the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Let us denote the volume of the tumour by T and that of the host (healthy) tissue by H, such that  = T  H is the total volume of the biological tissues involved (macroscopic level).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis domain  is bounded by  = V + T, where V are surfaces with vessel inlets or outlets, T are surfaces with no vessel inlets or outlets, and the tumourhost interface boundary is denoted by I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The boundary  is set sufficiently distant from the tumour region to avoid the imposed boundary conditions impacting the solution in the tissue volume of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1A shows a schematic representation of the analysis domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005259.g001  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The equations that describe the balance of the various biophysical species are expressed in a Lagrangian frame of reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence the Laplacian operators used to express Fickian diffusion are expressed with respect to the initial (reference) setting: .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst the vasculature is treated separately, the surrounding interstitium, comprised of cells and matrix, is treated as one phase with uniform properties; inertial terms corresponding to interstitial fluid flow are neglected for simplicity, given the small Reynolds number for these flows compared to vascular transport (for example).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong-form equations are then transformed into the corresponding weak-form, and subsequently discretised using the conventional finite element (FE) method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-integration of the biochemical solver module is achieved using an explicit numerical scheme (forward Euler method), whereas the solid solver module, which incorporates the growth model, utilises a full-implicit iterative (Newton-Raphson) scheme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More details are provided in the Solution strategy: Coupled multiscale solver subsection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A schematic illustration of the discretisation method of the tissue and the vascular-network domain is shown in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It demonstrates that the two finite element meshes are non-conforming, where the 1D vascular network is contained in the 3D grid of the tissues (either healthy or pathological) without sharing any nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two meshes are superimposed in Fig 1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, two vascular network properties with respect to the tissue grid are defined: the tip density, t, which is equal to the number of tip vascular nodes, Nt, contained in a tissue element; and the vascular density v. Nv is the number of well-perfused vascular nodes contained in a tissue element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Definition of a well-perfused vascular node is explicitly provided in the Capillary wall remodelling subsection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in the initial state (t = 0), the vasculature is uniformly distributed in the healthy tissue with all inlets and outlets confined to two opposite planes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following section details the construction of the solid, biochemical, vascular and fluid models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All variables (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oxygen concentration, metalloproteinases concentration, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are normalised relative to typical values for ease of presentation; these normalisation scales, and all parameter values within the models are given in the Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present the model equations for each (solid, biochemical, vascular, fluid) model first, and suspend assigning initial and boundary conditions for the model until the Initial and boundary conditions subsection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tissue_biomechanics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue_biochemical_model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the first steps in angiogenesis is the production of diffusible angiogenic growth factors (such as VEGF, PDGF, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  by tumour cells, and their subsequent binding to corresponding receptors of nearby blood vessels [38].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For model simplicity, we focus on a single growth factorreferred here as the tumour-angiogenic factor (TAF)as a homogenised chemical modulator of capillary sprouting and elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be straightforward to extend this model to account for multiple interacting growth factors (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGF binding receptors and inhibitors) to represent the complex patho-physiology of tumour-induced angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that it is well-documented that interstitial fluid velocities are weak compared to vascular flow and diffusion [39], we have not included advection in the tissue biochemical transport model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transport of TAF (with normalised concentration denoted ) is described by a reaction-diffusion equation [15] that accounts for random spatial diffusion, TAF production as a function of the normalised local oxygen concentration, , in the tumour (defined below), and its natural decay and finally loss due to cellular consumption,  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(12)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where D is the isotropic diffusion coefficient for TAF (given in m2 day-1),  represents the aggregate loss due both decay and cellular consumption, the production rate Q (given in day-1) is defined by  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

where  is a scaling parameter that modulates the oxygen level at which cancer cells release TAF, and  is a TAF-production rate parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameter values are provided in S3 Table, including references to the relevant literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The microvascular network provides a uniform source of oxygen, which diffuses into the interstitial space and is consumed by the cells [28], such that  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(13)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where D is the isotropic diffusion coefficient for oxygen (given in m2 day-1),  is the oxygen production rate due to supply from the microvascular network and  is the consumption rate of the species by the cancerous cells (both expressed in day-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the dimensionless parameter v represents the average vascular density in a tissue FE; if fully-functional, well-perfused blood vessels are present in a particular element then v = 1, whereas if the vessels are hypo-perfused or non-functional (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  collapsed) or absent then v = 0; see Fig 1B and 1C for a visual guide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Definition and differentiation of a well-perfused from a hypo-perfused node of the vascular network is explicitly provided in the Capillary wall remodelling subsection, while definition of a collapsed vascular node is given further in the Interaction between the tumourhost biomechanics and the capillaries subsection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the concentration of the matrix-degrading enzymes: MMPs, , in the extracellular space of the host tissue is modelled through [15, 40]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(14)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here D (m2 day-1) is the isotropic diffusion coefficient for MMPs, while  (day-1) represents the natural decay of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The production rate function F of MMPs (day-1) is taken as the superposition of contributions of production from the proliferating cancer cells and the tip-endothelial cells, defined as:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In a similar fashion to v, the dimensionless variable t represents the density of tip vascular nodes in a finite element of the tissue domain, which is zero when no newly-formed sprouts are present and increases proportionally with the number of branches present (see Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidently, both v and t vary with respect to space since not all finite elements contain vascular segments or tip vessels, and also with respect to time due to the temporal evolution of the network structure as it undergoes angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As is evidenced by Eqs (12), (13) and (14), the diffusion coefficients are assumed to be constant and homogeneous everywhere (see S3 Table for the parameter values).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mathematical model of tumour-induced angiogenesis hence assumes linear, Fickian diffusion of the chemical species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Angiogenesis_model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A description of the dynamic angiogenesis model is presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model is decomposed into to two primary components: a model of capillary sprouting, and a model that couples capillary wall mechanics with growth-induced solid and fluid mechanical loads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Initial_and_boundary_conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using Fig 1A as reference, the solid solver boundary conditions are defined as follows: traction-free (S  n = 0, where n is the outward surface normal) on the outer surfaces without inlets or outlets, V; zero displacements (u = 0) on the outer surfaces with inlets or outlets, T (to avoid rigid body motion); continuity of stress and displacement on the tumourhost interface, I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No residual stresses are considered in the present analysis, hence the initial tissue deformation is zero (Fe = Fg = I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to replicate an initially healthy host environment (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  prior to angiogenic tumour development), a uniform distribution of capillaries having approximately uniform diameter, thickness and pore size is imposed initially (see S3 Table), whereas the tumour environment is initially avascular with the mean inter-capillary distance being 0.6 millimetres approximately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assumption of initial-state parallel, unbranched vessels is based on previous pertinent work in tumour-induced angiogenesis [13, 15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the fluid solver, 0.1 mm-Hg interstitial fluid pressure was assigned on the tissue boundary V according to [53], and the interstitial fluid flux was assumed continuous at the tumourhost interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vascular pressure, pvsc, is prescribed at the inlet and outlet vascular nodes of the initial network as 25 mm-Hg and 10 mm-Hg, respectively [54].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, throughout the analysis, pvsc = 0 is enforced at every node belonging to a collapsed vessel, in order to effectively model the obstruction of the natural flow of erythrocytes and plasma at that part of the vascular network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the biochemical solver, zero-flux boundary conditions of all species are applied at the outer boundary of the tissue region,  (and note the domain is chosen to be sufficiently large that this does not impact the solution in the main body of the tissue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuity of concentration and its flux are assumed at the tumourhost interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial conditions are  =  =  = 0 everywhere except for the healthy tissue domain, where  = 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial condition for the ordinary differential Eq (1) describing the ECM density is  = 1 in the entire region of the analysis domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Solution_strategy__Coupled_multiscale_solver  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The problem under consideration is transient by nature and the modelling framework, as described in the previous section, consists of four interconnected core components, namely the Vascular Network Module, the Biochemical Solver Module, the Solid Solver Module and the Fluid Solver Module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 illustrates the building blocks of the proposed modelling framework in a flow diagram and the interaction amongst them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numerical procedure of the coupled tumour-growth and tumour-induced angiogenesis multiscale solver is outlined in the following section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mathematical model identifies three different time-discretisation scales, one for each of the first three solver modules:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to ensure that the explicit time integration scheme of the biochemical equations produces stable solutions, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition needs to be satisfied; given the smallest-element size in the 3D mesh, a very short time step has been adopted of the order of a few seconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, to ensure that the nonlinear solid mechanics solver converges after a reasonable number of Newton-Raphson iterations (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  four or five), the corresponding time increment has been set equal to approximately one hour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, after parametrically investigating the results produced by the vascular network update module, time increment tv has been set to six hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note here that using large values of tv can generate long, straight vascular segments, hence influencing the prediction of the vascular tree shape and organisation; whereas using very small tv can increase the computational cost substantially, since the generation of very small vascular segments will result in a rapid increase in the number of degrees-of-freedom in the final system of the fluid mechanics solver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of the model variables v and t, to ensure that a newly-formed vascular segments passes through (and not crosses) any tissue element (see Fig 1), the 3D mesh density of the analysis domain must be properly selected, as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum elongation length from Eq (17) gives: (vv-max tv) = 0.0625 mm (see material parameter S4 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the minimum element size of the 3D mesh must be greater or equal to maximum elongation lengthin the present analysis the minimum edge length (at the centre of the analysis domain; see S1 Fig) is 0.07 mm approximately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The algorithmic structure is as follows:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above procedure is repeated until the termination of tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details about the FE implementation of the proposed tumour-induced angiogenesis and growth model are provided in the S1 File.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A series of simulations are performed and parameters related to the growth of the tumour, the evolution of intra-tumoural fluid and solid stresses, as well as the vascular density and functionality are presented and validated against published experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted vascular geometry is compared with geometrical characteristics of experimentally-derived vascular networks that we calculated from angiography images of MCaIV murine mammary adenocarcinomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the model is able to replicate features of angiogenic tumour growth in MCaIV mouse tumours, and also demonstrate that a mechano-sensitive model is necessary to provide a representative physiological description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the analysis performed to obtain the mouse model data are provided in S2 File.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the simulations, a cubic domain (12 mm edge length) of tissue is considered, with an initial cancer mass embedded in the cube centre, represented by a sphere of 1 mm diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tumour geometry is representative of tumours grown in immunodeficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A three-dimensional finite element mesh is constructed using Gmsh, consisting of 3320 hexahedra and 3963 nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 Fig depicts the modelling domain, including the finite element meshes, the tumour location and size, and the initial network of capillaries embedded in the ECM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the tumour is initially avascular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The material parameters adopted in this study are listed in the Supporting Information Tables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most parameters are taken from the literature, with some chosen specifically from murine mammary adenocarcinoma experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First of all we discuss the validation of the model, and next we present the simulation results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To qualitatively validate the fluid solver predictions, Fig 4A presents the average interstitial fluid pressure, pint, distribution in the tumour and the peri-tumoural area for various time instants, where the centre of the tumour is at zero radial distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complementary to this plot, the significant variability of the IFP is shown in Fig 5 as a function of radial distance from the tumour centre for a number of time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a rapid increase in the IFP is observed within one day, as a result of the formation and elongation of new and hyper-permeable capillary sprouts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reflects the patho-physiological nature of such sprouts, which typically have a discontinuous endothelial lining and no basal membrane, rendering them hyper-permeable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boucher and colleagues [56] measured the IFP for two rat tissue tumour types (mammary adenocarcinoma and Walker 256 carcinoma) using micro-pipettes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the numerical predictions, shown in Fig 4A, with the experimental results reported by Boucher et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (see Fig 3 in [56]), a strong qualitative agreement is observed in the drop of the IFP away from the tumourhost interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numerical predictions also show that the IFP reaches a maximum plateau throughout the tumour, which, despite the significant increase of tumour volumefrom 19.06 mm3 in day-10 to 141.37 mm3 in day-40remains relatively stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean plateau IFP predicted by the model is approximately 8.3 mm-Hg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This falls within the experimentally measured pressure range reported previously for tissue-isolated (9.1Â±3.9 mm-Hg; see Table 2 in [56]) and subcutaneous (7.8Â±3.8 mm-Hg; see Table 2 in [56]) small-size tumours (less_than1 g), while it is also in qualitative agreement with the IFP measurements [37] for MCaIV-type murine mammary carcinomas (5.6Â±1.2 mm-Hg; see Fig 3F in [37]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further qualitative validation of the fluid solver was performed by examining the interstitial fluid velocity (IFV), calculated from Darcys law (see Eq (11)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that the tissue hydraulic conductivity is constant, the IFV is driven only by gradients of the IFP local to the tumourhost tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as illustrated in Fig 5, the IFP remains relatively flat in the tumour region and decreases rapidly when moving from the tumour to the healthy tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the IFV in the tumour centre is negligible compared to the corresponding pronounced IFV measured near the tumour boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is visualised in S10 and S11 Videos: the IFV gradually increases in the tumour centre during angiogenesis, whereas abrupt IFV elevation is observed at the tumour periphery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter observation is made more evident in S12 and S13 Videos, where the IFV peak values are predicted primarily in the vicinity of collapsing blood vessels of the original network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, drastic changes in the functionality of the tumour vasculature lead to loss of balance in the microvascular pressure distribution and the intra- and extravasation flux of plasma/proteins in the capillaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This drives dynamic changes in the IFP, which subsequently result in larger IFP gradients and hence a larger IFV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the above predictions confirm the hypothesis that there is significant interstitial hypertension in the tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum estimated value of the fluid velocity in the interstitium was approximately 0.15 m/s, which is in qualitative agreement with the experimentally measured values (0.6Â±0.2 m/s) reported in the early paper of Chary and Jain [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 4B, the magnitude of the mechanical forces in the stromai.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the tissue hydrostatic pressure (THP) which is equal to one third of the trace of the stress tensor, also referred as the mean solid stressis shown as a function of the radial distance from the centre of the tumour at several time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also Fig 6 reports the spatial distribution of THP at various time instants, where both the average value of the THP and the standard deviation (in error bars) is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the fluid-pressure distributions in the interstitium shown in the Fig 5, THP shows substantial spatio-temporal variability primarily at the interface of the tumour and the host tissue (vertical red bar in Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be explained by the anisotropic growth driven by the irregular angiogenic vasculature, which provides a non-uniform supply of oxygen to the tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support the idea of a heterogeneous force environment at the tumour periphery, consistent with the observations reported in the past [4, 59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Numerous features of our evolving vascular structures recapitulate experimental observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First of all, the mean inter-capillary distance increased from around 0.557 mm to 0.771 mm at the end of simulation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with experimental measurements, for example in stage IIb and III carcinomas of the cervix (measured using histochemistry, see [60]), where the average inter-capillary distance in the cancerous tissue was around 304Â±30 m higher than that in healthy tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, our predictions of tumour vascular density (defined as blood vessel surface area divided by the tissue volume, normalised against the corresponding healthy tissue value) are reported in Fig 7, for mechano- and haptotactic stimuli switched on or off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalised vascular density increases in time as the tumour grows, reaching around 3.4 and 3.0 with/without the mechano-/haptotactic stimuli by the end of the simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in good agreement with reported measurements [6163], which lie in the range 3.3 to 5.0, with the inclusion of mechanical stimuli improving the agreement with measured observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Validation_against_new_experimental_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vascular density and inter-capillary distance alone do not assess the functionality of the three-dimensional vasculature in its entirety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, solute (such as oxygen and drugs) delivery is determined by diffusion distances from the vessels, and influenced by the spatial architecture and organisation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider the averaged power spectrum of the distance map computed on the vascular network, which was originally proposed by Risser et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [64] in brain tumours (and further used by Baish et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [65]) for assessing the diffusive capacity of drugs in normal tissue and tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We introduce two scaling parameters v and v-max, following the approach of Baish [65]; the first measures the shape of the space between blood vessels, whereas the second estimates the shortest distance between a tissue point and vessel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We compare here the model predictions of parameters v and v-max against the experimentally measured values, extracted by quantifying the vascular structure in murine breast carcinomas using in-vivo imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images of the tumour vasculature were obtained in a previous research study using the optical frequency domain imaging [22].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, brief description of the present analysis of the in-vivo images can be found in S2 File.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison of the two scaling parameters is summarised in Fig 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model predictions of v agree very well with the in-vivo data, and this agreement is improved with the mechano-/haptotactic stimuli switched on compared to off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an extremely promising validation step of our in-silico cancer model, which provides strong evidence that our inclusion of mechano- and haptotaxis is highly relevant to predicting and testing delivery of diffusible agents to vascular tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of the parameter v-max is less conclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trend offered by the experimental data points here is less well-defined (see Fig 8B); our model certainly predicts differing behaviours with the mechano- and haptotactic terms switched on/off, and there are currently insufficient experimental data points to draw a conclusion on which model prediction is correct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Oxygen-driven_growth_and_network_remodelling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Non-isotropic growth is driven by the non-uniform spatial distribution of capillaries at the tumour periphery and henceas described by Eq (3) and the relation defining Fgthe resulting oxygen distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 9 (see also S1 video), the tumour is illustrated to grow due to the oxygen transcending from the vasculature and diffusing in the interstitial space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The visualisation also demonstrates dynamic network remodelling: not only do the vessels lack a regular hierarchy and structure, but they also display a higher degree of tortuosity than the initial (healthy) vascular network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In S2 Fig, the numerically predicted increase of the cancer mass as a function of time (in days) is illustrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_enables_quantification_of_vessel_perfusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The in-silico cancer model enables a quantitative investigation of blood flow in the evolving vascular network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 fig compares the mean blood flow velocity with vessel diameter (considering functional i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  non-collapsed vessels only) at different time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such information is extremely hard to measure accurately using experimental methods, given the requirement to image flow in individual microvessels of micron-level diameters; a validated in-silico framework is therefore highly valuable in providing insight into microvessel functional behaviours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 10 shows the perfusion state of the vasculature as a function of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blood vessels are distinguished into functional and non-functional (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  collapsed) vessels, with the former being categorised according to their mean blood velocity (MBV) as hypo-perfused (BMV less_than0.1 mm/s), perfused (BMV in the range 0.10.5 mm/s) and well-perfused (BMV  greater than 0.5 mm/s) (this follows the convention proposed by Kamun et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [48]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of hypo-perfused vessels increases quickly over the first 10 to 15 days, primarily driven by the unregulated vessel sprouting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this time, the increase slows as a consequence of anastomosis and branching of vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechano-_and_haptotaxis_play_an_important_role_in_tumour-induced_angiogenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To date, mathematical models of angiogenesis have mostly focused on chemotactic (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGF) and haptotactic tip cell migration as determinants of vascular sprouting and branching (key example papers [18, 23, 6668]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies do not incorporate the impact of mechanotaxis in determining vascular topology, and both vascular and tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigate the hypothesis that vascular structure during tumour growth is influenced by chemo-, mechano- and haptotactic stimuli in combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we carry out simulations when chemotaxis alone determines the vessel tip extension rate and direction, and compare them against those where all three stimuli are included (see Eq (15)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 7 we compare the normalised vascular density (as defined previously) as a function of time with chemotaxis in isolation, with the case of combined chemo-, hapto- and mechanotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When only chemotaxis is active, the pathway of the tumour vessels is dictated by the gradients of TAF, where TAFowing to the isotropic diffusion of these chemical cues in the ECMis distributed spherically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the elongation direction vector of the newly-formed sprouts points towards the tumour centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, owing to the growing tumour mass, solid stresses increase dramatically at the peritumoural stroma (especially at day 10 and onwards; see Fig 6), inducing collapse of the infiltrating nascent vessels when mechanical cues for vessel growth are included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, when chemo-, hapto- and mechanotaxis are combined, the pattern of angiogenesis changes significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Careful inspection of the simulation results reveals that the elevated mechanical forces at the peritumoural stroma re-direct the vessels to elongate circumferentially and, thus, increase the likelihood for the formation of anastomoses and vascular shunts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, anastomoses are evident after day 10 owing to the growing population of microvessels and the significant increase of branches adjacent to the tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Summarising the above, and as shown in Fig 7, our in-silico model predicts an increase of the normalised vascular density in the combined taxis case of angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Also, Fig 8 compares the numerically predicted scalar parameters v and v-max in the two cases of taxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined mode model produces higher normalised vascular densities, more consistent with experimental measurements, and also provides an excellent prediction of v, as discussed in the previous section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis indicates that hapto- and mechanotaxis may play an important role in determining the density and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of angiogenic vessels in tumours; in turn, these structural features of the vasculature are key in predicting diffusion of solutes (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oxygen, drugs) into the interstitial space, and thus drug penetration and efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model incorporates these mechanical stimuli, and could be used in the future to optimise tumour drug delivery and dosage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the model has predictive capability to characterise tumour solid stresses, and their interplay with tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fig 11 illustrates in snapshots the in-silico predictions of tumour-induced angiogenesis when chemo-, mechano- and haptotaxis is taken into account (images on the left of each column), and when chemotaxis applies only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, from day 30 onwards, the tumour vessels follow a rather radial extension pattern in the pure chemotaxis case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when mechano- and haptotactic cues are also considered, the growing vessels are observed to encapsulate (rather than penetrate) the tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tumour framing effect becomes more striking when the minimum TAF threshold required for angiogenesis, *, is lowered (see following subsection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, particularly at days 35 and 40, the formation of vascular shunts is also more pronounced when all three taxes (referred to as the combined mode) are included, vessel tortuosity is increased, and the presence of anastomoses is also more frequent (see also S14 Video).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are characteristic features of tumour vasculature, and it is highly promising that they are promoted by an in-silico model that includes mechanotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Angiogenesis_is_strongly_determined_by_TAF-levels_and_vascular-wall_rigidity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the dependency of angiogenic vascular growth on various model parameters was examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sensitivity analysis of all parameters was performed and those with the largest influence on the normalised vascular density were identified, namely the TAF concentration and vascular wall stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 12A shows the normalised vascular density as a function of time for various values of the TAF threshold, (*), above which angiogenesis is permitted (all other parameters were kept constant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A non-linear dependency of the vascular density on * is observed, with a value of * = 0.02 producing a monotonic increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reflects the inherent non-linearity of TAF-induced vessel production, and suggests that the TAF threshold can quash other limiting factorssuch as collapse from solid stresswhich cause a decrease in vascular density above day 35 for the lower threshold values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This establishes TAF as a dominant factor in angiogenesis, which is in agreement with previous findings [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the response on vascular mechanics, Fig 12B shows the normalised vascular density as a function of time for various values of the maximum wall stiffness, Ew-max; all other parameters were kept constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, in the baseline test 1.3  Ew-max  5.22, whichas described in the previous section, and given that the critical radial strain a capillary can sustain is approximately 0.92is equivalent to the critical pressure for capillary wall collapse 1.6  pc  3.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first sensitivity test the stiffness was increased by a factor of 10, and in the second test by a further factor of 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This produced a highly nonlinear response, with a monotonic increase in the vascular density in time observed for both sensitivity tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering Eq (21), a capillary segment is assumed collapsed when the sum of the interstitial fluid pressure and the tissue hydrostatic pressure is at least pc-times larger than the microvascular pressure at this segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, these results suggest that increasing pc by a factor of 10 renders the vessels essentially immune to collapse by external solid and fluid pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fig 13 illustrates the impact of the microvascular wall stiffness in the predictions of the tumour growth and angiogenesis simulator (see also the animation of S15 Video).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is evident from this figure that enabling vessel wall more resilient (rightmost column of images), nascent vessels can resist and withstand the elevated mechanical forces at the tumour periphery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, they can penetrate the tumour whose growth is speeded up and is slightly pronouncedprovided that functional and well-perfused vessels supply the core of the cancer mass with vital nutrients and oxygenas opposed to for example the baseline case (leftmost column of images).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, varying the wall stiffness in our coupled model produces a similar effect on the vascular density predictions to that when varying the TAF threshold triggering angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This work presents a validated three-dimensional mathematical and computational framework that encompasses solid tumour growth and tumour induced angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in-silico cancer model has been implemented in our in-house, open-source numerical platform FEB3 (see for details S1 file).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed multiscale approach is capable of modelling the mechanical interactions between healthy and cancerous tissues, and associated vasculature, with the solid (tissue) and the fluid (blood) part of the tumour environment modelled separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The important novel contributions of our model are: (i) the dynamic remodelling of the vascular network under mechanical stress during tumour growth, (ii) the incorporation of mechanotaxis (alongside chemo- and haptotaxis) in the determination of vessel sprouting orientation and speed, (iii) the collapse of tumour blood vessels as a consequence of solid stress produced by the surrounding tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model recapitulates experimental observations of fluid and solid pressure (and fluid velocity) distributions, vascular density and three-dimensional spatial arrangement, with the improvement between experimentally measured and theoretically predicted vascular measurements increasing upon the inclusion of hapto- and mechano-tactic (alongside chemotactic) stimuli in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This supports our hypothesis that hapto- and mechanotaxis play an important role in determining the density and 3D spatial arrangement of tumour induced vasculature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As further data that quantify tumour vascular structures become available, we will continue to test the applicability of the metrics v-max, v in capturing intra-tumour heterogeneity, as well as tumour-to-tumour variations, alongside the ability of our mechanotactic model in predicting these changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the complexity of the proposed framework, our model remains subject to some limitations; particularly, we do not model space- and time-varying haematocrit and relative blood viscosity [50, 54, 70], or the impact of the lymphatic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The focus of this study was the investigation of the coupling between tumour vasculature, growth and the generation of solid stresses, and therefore these features were ignored at this stage, for the sake of simplicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, we envisage to incorporate in a future version of the tumour angiogenesis module an elaborate model of vascular wall-remodelling and biomechanics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the biomechanical properties of the microvascular wall (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  lumen size, thickness and pore size) could explicitly be described with respect to local gradients of chemical cues affecting the endothelium integrity (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  stiffness, permeability).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we will model the spatio-temporal biomechanics of the microvasculature in a more physiologically realistic manner; this will, for example, overcome the simplification of isotropic mechanical compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we plan to extend the present in-silico tumour model to account for polyclonal cell populations and, thus, investigate the importance of the angiogenesis in the interplay between different cancer cell phenotypes (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  proliferative versus invasive phenotype) under different vascularisation regimes [71], as well for various tumour-related cell types (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cancer-associated fibroblasts, cancer-associated macrophages, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, the increased sophistication of our computational framework results in a large number of model parameters presented in S1S4 Tables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the model parameters were determined independently from the others based on previous studies and experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other parametersnot found in the literaturewere defined in the current study so that model predictions to be physiologically relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The good agreement of model predictions with experiments that has been demonstrated in this work validates the choice of model parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we performed a parametric analysis of the parameters that play a key role in the angiogenesis procedure and in the compression of the blood vessels (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mechano-/haptotaxis, TAF threshold for angiogenesis, vessel wall stiffness), which are the two factors of tumour progression that our work has been focused on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation of other model parameters is expected to change the results only quantitatively, while qualitatively the model predictions and the conclusions of this study will remain the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note that the model framework we present is deterministic; a natural next step would be to investigate variability in the model predictions induced by stochastic features, for example, of the initial vasculature (length, diameter and separation of vessels), informed by distributions of these data as measured in practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We leave this to future work, but note its important in understanding tissue heterogeneity, both within an individual tumour, and between tumours of the same/different type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, our model can be further used as a platform for the study of the delivery of drugs to solid tumours by adding equations for the transport of the therapeutic agent into the vascular network, across the vessel walls and into the tumour interstitial space [4, 26, 72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the efficacy of strategies that target the tumour microenvironment to enhance the delivery of drugssuch as vascular normalization and stress alleviation treatmentscan be studied in more detail than by existing models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
