The keybox: Shape-frame fitting during tool use in Goffins cockatoos (Cacatua goffiniana)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability to move an object in alignment to a surface develops early in human ontogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, aligning not just your own body but also the object itself in relation to a surface with a specific shape requires using landmarks rather than the own body as a frame of reference for orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to do so is considered important in the development of tool use behaviour in human and non-human animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from humans, with the exception of a single study on habitually tool using primates, shape-frame matching abilities remain largely unstudied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Goffin's cockatoo is a generalist parrot, and not a specialised tool user but has shown the capacity to innovate and use different types of tools under controlled settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested these parrots in a tool selection and tool use task featuring objects and their corresponding substrate grooves in a number of shapes with different levels of symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects had to choose the correct key to insert into a box, and align its shape to fit into the corresponding keyhole in the box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parrots were able to select the correct key above chance level from early on in the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite their lack of hands, they required fewer placement attempts than primates to insert simple object shapes into corresponding grooves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For complex shapes, they reduced their insertion effort by rotating shapes in their beak while avoiding as many protrusions as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unrewarded play experience with similar object shapes was provided to some of the subjects previously to testing, but did not seem to have an effect on the number of correct choices or on insertion effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fitting an object into a matching outline in a substrate such as inserting a key into a lock or the appropriate screwdriver bit into a screw is a recurrent part of many human technical procedures and, in its simplest forms, develops within the first years of human life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, developmental studies on human infants indicate that children have difficulties inserting an elongated object into a slot of similar length before the age of 22 months [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Older children start rotating the object into the proper position before bringing it into contact with the slot, indicating that vision plays an important role in their shape-frame matching abilities [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a posting task featuring a round disc and a slot, 18-month-old children were able to orient their own hands but not the disc they here holding in the appropriate way for inserting it [2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they succeeded when the disc was pre-aligned prior to insertion, suggesting that children below the age of 2 have more trouble orienting an object in relation to a substrate than orienting a part of their own body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is largely because human and non-human animals use two different spatial frames of reference when moving parts of their own body (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  a hand) or objects in space: when using an egocentric frame of reference, we move objects relative to our own body, and when using an allocentric one we use environmental objects as landmarks for orientation [3, 4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moving an object relative to other objects/substrates, as required when inserting an object into a matching frame is considered to be harder than moving it in relation to ones own body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Humans start to develop an allocentric frame of reference in the first year of their life, but it improves over a period of several years [5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout human ontogeny, the improvement of an allocentric frame of reference is also closely linked to the development of tool use [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that being able to use an allocentric frame of reference is an important prerequisite for the development of flexible tool use in animals as well [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another important aspect of shape-frame matching is geometry, as it imposes the number of relations that must be managed simultaneously: a circular object has only one point of reference, whereas a stick-like object with an axis has at least four points that need to be taken into account: two defining the axis of the object and two defining the axis of the groove [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a lower degree of symmetry adds to the complexity of the task: a circle has infinite sides of symmetry all going through its centre, a square-shaped object has four sides of symmetry, whereas an equal sided triangle has only three.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, in the case of the circular object, as long as you place it in the center of the opening, its orientation does not matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The square however has 4 possible correct orientations for each front side (turning the object 90° to achieve insertion, and 8 correct orientations turning the object 180° etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), whereas the front side of a triangle has only 3 (it needs to be turned up to 120°, 6 correct orientations when turned 180°).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, according to the Bayley Scales of Infant Development [8], a widely used tool to assess childrens mental, motor and language skills, human infants can insert a ball in a circular opening at 1 year of age, but can only insert a cube into a square opening when they are almost 2 years old.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even more complex are asymmetrical objects, because they can only be inserted in one way and the number of axes that need to be managed relative to the groove is determined by the number of object features added [7, 9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fragaszy et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [9] tested a setup on human infants, in which up to 2 features were added to a single rectangular groove and a matching object: They found that 2, 3 and 4-year-old children consistently aligned a bar-shaped stick and a cross-shaped stick (with one long and one short axis at the top), but had difficulty aligning a tomahawk-shaped stick to a corresponding substrate groove.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two older age classes routinely held the objects above the cutout, comparing it visually before attempting to align it, again suggesting that they did use vision to facilitate their shape-frame matching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When habitually tool using primates, namely capuchin monkeys and chimpanzees, were tested using the same setup [7], both species aligned the long axis of the bar-shaped object with the matching groove more often than expected by chance but with poor precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some individuals within both species managed to align the second axis in the cross condition, with subjects making 4 times as many placement-attempts to succeed in the latter alignment than in the original bar condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one capuchin monkey achieved above-chance success at matching 3 features in the tomahawk condition with the corresponding cutouts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although they do seem to be able to align simple object shapes such as the bar in an efficient manner, habitually tool using primates seemed to perform relatively poorly at this task and apparently lack the visual object guidance of even a 2-year-old human despite having been shown to possess considerable hand-eye coordination [10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the above experiment is to our knowledge the only study investigating shape-frame matching in any non-human, we do not yet know whether it evolved as a by-product of digital dexterity in primates or whether it can also develop convergently in other species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although most parrots, except for the black Palm cockatoo (Probosciger aterrimus) [11,12] are not known to be using tools habitually on a population wide level in the wild, many parrot species playfully insert objects into substrate openings [1315].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conspicuously, the pet industry offers various enrichment toys specifically for parrots that resemble simple fitting tasks for human children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During an experiment on object play [14] featuring various differently shaped objects, we were able to repeatedly observe Goffin's cockatoos (Cacatua goffiniana) carrying and inserting objects into substrate features inside the aviary that composed nearly an exact frame around the object (S1 Fig).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They did so lacking any previous re-enforcement or training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, studies on Goffin's cockatoos indicate the capacity for complex forms of tool use and manufacture through innovation in captivity [16] and arguably in a few feral individuals according to unpublished data by Osuna-Mascaro & Auersperg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tool use of captive individuals is flexibly adjusted depending on the problem at hand [1719].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this allows us to investigate shape-frame matching in both unrewarded as well as tool-using contexts for the first time in a non-primate model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a series of experiments, we aim to look into several aspects of the shape-frame matching abilities of the Goffin's cockatoo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a first instance, we are interested in the behaviour within the context of unrewarded object play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We would like to determine the rate of reoccurrence of playful shape-frame matching and whether this particular type of object play is restricted to specific object shapes and/or to certain individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to our previous observations a few years ago, we predict that cockatoos will playfully match shapes to frames irregularly and that they will match highly symmetrical shapes such as circles more often than less symmetrical shapes in this context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, we aim to test shape-frame matching in a tool using context using a box featuring several different types of keyholes that allow for the insertion of only one out of a selection of 3 or 5 object shapes (keys).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The keyholes have different levels of symmetry and differently shaped features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within this tool use task, we first want to look at tool selection: Are the birds able to select the correct tool for the keyhole at hand and is performance spontaneous or is there a learning process involved?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the cockatoos have been shown to react flexibly and sensibly in a tool selection task featuring two very different tasks [19], learning a simple virtual matching to sample task on the touch screen was a long and tedious process which did not lead to success in many cases [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the birds are able to select the objects that corresponded to the correct frames, it would indicate that adding physical context to a matching to sample task increases performance, as has been shown in a few other species, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kea (Nestor notabilis) [21], Pigeons (Columba livia) [22] and humans [23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second aspect of the keybox task we are interested in the effect of object/frame geometry on insertion success/effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We would like to establish if the animals only succeed when inserting specific shapes, and within the successful shapes which geometric forms cause most difficulty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on previous results on human infants and primates [7, 9] we expect the animals to follow insertion patterns as predicted for the unrewarded object play experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we would like to assess the effect of shape-frame matching experience during object play on their performance in the keybox task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the benefits of object play is in many cases speculated to be practicing the neuro-muscular system for enhanced performance when confronted with future foraging problems [24, 25], however this has rarely been tested systematically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Demery & Chappell [26] tested Senegal parrots (Poicephalus senegalus) and kakarikis (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae) sensitivity to a change of visible (colour, shape) and invisible (weight) cues during object exploration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both species explored functional and invisible changes more than non-functional or visible ones, and interestingly, asymmetrical objects more than symmetrical ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because object play presents animals with an opportunity to explore objects physical properties, we therefore predict an effect of previous object play experience on both the performance in selecting the appropriate tool as well as on insertion efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subjects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
13 adult, captive- born and hand-reared Goffins cockatoos (Cacatua goffiniana), participated in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The subjects (8 males, 5 females) were kept in a single-species group at the Goffin Lab of the University of Veterinary Medicine (Vienna, Austria) and were housed in a large, enriched aviary with an indoors and outdoors area (in total ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  200 m2 ground, space up to 6m high).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All parrots were kept on an ad libitum diet (fresh and dried fruits, boiled vegetables, a mixture of boiled and raw seeds and fresh water).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further information about the subjects see S1 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Unrewarded_shape_matching  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the Unrewarded Shape Matching (USM) section of this study we tested the propensity of our subjects to playfully establish unrewarded shape-matching relationships between objects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This monitoring block additionally served as pre-experience for 7 of the 13 birds in order to assess a possible effect of enhanced play experience on later task performance, which was conducted immediately after the monitoring block had ended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During testing, the 7 subjects were visually isolated from the remaining group and exposed to different playsets (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each playset consisted of yellow wooden substrate boards with either indentions and their correspondingly shaped free objects, or poles and discs with the corresponding negatives (see Fig 1 for dimensions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrate boards were placed next to each other in random order and the objects were scattered around (or pre-stacked/inserted upon/into; see phase 2) them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wooden playsets were offered in three consecutive phases: in phase 1, the shaped objects were all scattered around the substrates (shaped poles or holes); in phase 2 one set of objects was pre-stacked/pre-inserted onto/into the poles/holes to enhance unstacking behaviour; during phase 3, the subjects received one stacking/unstacking demonstration by a human demonstrator for each substrate (pole/hole) in random order before receiving the setup as in phase 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were free to interact with each playset (in the same order A, B, C) in an unrewarded context (each phase consisting of 5 sessions, which lasted for 30 minutes in phases 1 and 2, and 10 minutes in phase 3 respectively)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within all phases, we scored the frequencies of object-substrate (poles/holes) combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the latter, three distinctions were made: incorrect (combined shapes do not match); correct (combined shapes match but are not fully stacked/ inserted) and successful shape-match (correct object is successfully stacked/inserted).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All trials were videotaped (JVC Camcorder Model No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  : GZ-HM30BE) and coded in situ as well as from the videos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We counted all object combinations with the substrate grooves in the USM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within all object combinations we highlight combinations of objects with the correct frame and actual shape matches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the keybox test we scored the first object that was combined with the front of the keybox as correct/non-correct; whether the subject was successful in retrieving the food from the platform in this trial, if any objects and how many were lifted before one was combined with the frame (switch) for each keyset (A & B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in trials in which the correct object was used, we scored the duration from the first contact between the object and the box to the insertion (duration) and the number of times it was brought in contact with the opening (combination frequency).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter two scorings were only conducted for condition 1 in order to look at spontaneous performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unrewarded_shape_matching  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For playsets A-C subjects did not combine the object with their corresponding substrate grooves above chance expectation (One-Sample Wilcoxon tests N = 7, pless_than0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, for playsets A and C, the factors phase and object and, for playset B, the factor phase but not any other factors measured had a significant effect on both the number of correct combinations of objects with their corresponding grooves and shape matching (pless_than0.05; see S3 Table for detailed GLMM results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The factor session did not have a significant effect on performance for any of the target variables in any playset (S3 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posthoc tests indicate that birds improved across phases with more correct combinations of objects with corresponding grooves in phases 3 and 2 for playsets A and B (Wilcoxon signed Rank tests N = 7 PSA: Z = -2.207, p = 0.031; PSB: Z = -2.366, p = 0.016; non-sig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  trend for PSC: Z = -1.913, p = 0.063; there was no difference between phases 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 for any playset; see Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of shapes matched did not improve above trend levels across conditions (Wilcoxon signed rank tests N = 7 pless_than0.05) except for playset A, for which we similarly found a difference between phases 1 and 3 (Wilcoxon signed Rank test N = 7, Z = -2.201, p = 0.031).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding posthoc tests did not reveal differences either in the number of birds correct object-groove combinations nor shape matches between different types objects for any playset (Wilcoxon signed Rank tests N = 7, pless_than0.05)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Keybox  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When birds selected the correct object, they were nearly always able to obtain the food reward by inserting the key into the keyhole within the 5 minutes given (except for 19 trials of 936 in keyset A and 21 trials of 1560 in keyset B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unrewarded_shape_matching  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first part of our study, when birds were offered a selection of objects alongside various substrate cutouts in an unrewarded context, they combined objects with their corresponding cutouts at chance levels during the initial phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bringing a shape into contact with its corresponding frame thus seems to occur accidentally while trying to insert different objects into different substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behaviour seems to be driven by these cockatoos playful propensity to combine two objects or objects with substrates in different ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies indicate that such combinatory object play occurs at similar levels in this species as in habitually tool using birds such as New Caledonian crows and black Palm cockatoos [14,30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, experience in unstacking objects and, even more, human demonstrations strongly increased the number of correct object-substrate combinations as well as successful shape-frame matches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that both experiencing the manipulative effect of unstacking an object from a pole/indention as well as the social enhancement involved in a human demonstration strongly increases the birds motivation to interact with the object on the corresponding pole/substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, the birds seem to attempt to playfully repeat the experienced/observed action despite the lack of a reward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the strong effect of demonstrations is surprising as a previous study showed little impact of stimulus enhancement by a conspecific on the choice of a non-food object for rostral manipulation in this species [31].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A human may be associated with food from previous experiments and thus enhance exploration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, an object-substrate interaction may constitute a more interesting demonstration than a simple rostral manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incidentally, the birds have been shown to learn socially in a tool using context [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Keybox  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As soon as shape-frame matching became part of the solution to a tool using task in the keybox experiment, subjects became proficient at fitting the appropriate object into a corresponding opening, regardless of its shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results suggest that the ability to align objects to a corresponding substrate groove is neither limited to primates nor to habitually tool using species nor to animals with hand-like appendices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While our animals seem to use an allocentric frame of reference to achieve object insertions it is not yet possible to determine whether they construct the alignments in 3 dimensions as we were unable to observe small details of the adjustment of the object on the substrate with the birds blocking the view too often to obtain reliable data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Shape-frame matching abilities for capuchins and chimpanzees are likely to facilitate tool use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in both species various populations have been observed to use sticks to probe for food in different holes and crevices, and to crack nuts by placing the nut on an anvil and then striking the nut with a hammer stone, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3840].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Goffin's cockatoo cannot be considered a habitual tool user, at least not on a population-wide level as suggested by unpublished data from Osuna-Mascaro & Auersperg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, they are highly opportunistic foragers using different feeding techniques that include extractive foraging according to unpublished data from OHara & Mioduszewska.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While lacking primate hands, their beak is highly dexterous, with a flexible upper mandible and a tongue that can be moved in an almost thumb-like manner [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, Auersperg et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [13] and unpublished data from Osuna-Mascaro & Auersperg suggest that they have a strong predisposition to combine objects during play and occasionally also during foraging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From present knowledge, we can assume that their ability to align objects seems to derive from domain general flexibility rather than a specific specialisation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Future comparative research on the basics of object alignment should incorporate more avian species; particularly habitual and non-habitual tool using birds and nest building parrots would be of great interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Follow up research on the Goffin's cockatoo will focus on fine details of object alignment and beak-tongue actions on the object before and during insertion which we hope to achieve by filming from the inside of a Perspex box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will help us determine a better general overview of their fitting techniques and to evaluate the role of visual adjustment in these techniques [e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#
