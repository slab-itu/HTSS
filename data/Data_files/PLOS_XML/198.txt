A New Sail-Backed Styracosternan (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda) from the Early Cretaceous of Morella, Spain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A new styracosternan ornithopod genus and species is here described based on a partial postcranial skeleton and an associated dentary tooth of a single specimen from the Arcillas de Morella Formation (Early Cretaceous, late Barremian) at the Morella locality, (Castellón, Spain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morelladon beltrani gen. et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. is diagnosed by eight autapomorphic features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The set of autapomorphies includes: very elongated and vertical neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae, midline keel on ventral surface of the second to fourth sacral vertebrae restricted to the anterior half of the centrum, a posterodorsally inclined medial ridge on the postacetabular process of the ilium that meets its dorsal margin and distal end of the straight ischial shaft laterally expanded, among others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analyses reveal that the new Iberian form is more closely related to its synchronic and sympatric contemporary European taxa Iguanodon bernissartensis and Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis, known from Western Europe, than to other Early Cretaceous Iberian styracosternans (Delapparentia turolensis and Proa valdearinnoensis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recognition of Morelladon beltrani gen. et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. indicates that the Iberian Peninsula was home to a highly diverse medium to large bodied styracosternan assemblage during the Early Cretaceous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Until recently, the Early Cretaceous European fossil record of styracosternan iguanodonts was composed of basal representatives of the node-based clade Hadrosauriformes (sensu Sereno [1]), or members of the outgroup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delapparentia, Hypselospinus, Iguanodon, Mantellisaurus and Proa were the hadrosauriform styracosternans recognized from several Lower Cretaceous formations [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent re-evaluation of the phylogenetic relationships indicates a new subclade of non-hadrosauriform styracosternans (iguanodontoids) and includes most of these previously considered European hadrosauriforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this new view, all of the European Cretaceous large-bodied styracosternans lie outside of the Hadrosauriformes according to a new definition of the clade (see [6]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Presently, the Lower Cretaceous Iberian styracosternan iguanodontians species are the lower Barremian Delapparentia turolensis [2] and Iguanodon galvensis [5], the upper Barremian Iguanodon bernissartensis and Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis [710], and the lower Albian Proa valdearinnoensis [3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it should be noted that Norman [6] considers Delapparentia turolensis provisionally as a nomem dubium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, a new specimen is described from the Morella locality (Castellón province, Spain) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It comprises a well-preserved partial skeleton of a medium-sized iguanodontian, consisting of a complete right dentary tooth, six almost complete dorsal vertebrae, a dorsal centrum, several fragments of dorsal neural spines, two dorsal ribs fragments, a nearly complete sacrum, two haemal arches, ilia, incomplete pubes and ischia, and the right tibia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specimen was found in a body of red clays belonging to the upper Barremian Arcillas de Morella Formation [11].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide a detailed description of this new taxon and discuss its phylogenetic relationships within Iguanodontia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Phylogenetic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish the phylogenetic relationships of Morelladon we carried out two separate phylogenetic analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first analysis was based on the data matrix of McDonald et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3], which was recently modified to include new data from Fukuisaurus and Koshisaurus [34] and Delapparentia [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, as in Shibata and Azuma [34], Kukufeldia was excluded whereas character 110 was scored following Gasca et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final data matrix includes 69 taxa and 135 characters (S2 Supporting Information) and was processed with the phylogenetic software TNT [36] using a Traditional search (the starting trees were Wagner with a random seed of 1 and 9999 replicates; the tree bisection reconnection algorithm was used with 10 trees saved per replication).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis recovered 3240 most parsimonious trees (MPTs) with lengths of 427 steps [Consistency Index (CI) = 0.468, Retention Index (RI) = 0.797].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in McDonald et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3], the strict consensus tree was very poorly resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two iguanodontian clades are supported: Rhabdodontidae (Muttaburrasaurus, Rhabdodon, (Zalmoxes robustus, Z. shqiperorum)) and Tenontosaurus (T. dossi + T. tilletti), but nearly the whole of Iguanodontia is recovered in an unresolved polytomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to improve the resolution a second search was made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using PAUP 4.10b [37], the maximum agreement subtree was calculated, but Morelladon was among the 27 taxa excluded from the subtree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better explore the systematic position of Morelladon, a new data matrix was composed removing all the taxa excluded in the maximum agreement subtree, but not Morelladon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new data matrix included 42 taxa and 135 characters and was analysed in TNT with the same procedure described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis recovered 801 maximum agreement subtrees with lengths of 347 steps, [Consistency Index (CI) = 0.576, Retention Index (RI) = 0.869].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the strict reduced consensus tree (Fig 15), in addition to Iguanodontia, Ankylopollexia and Stryracosterna were also recovered as clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, with the exception of Iguanacolossus and the clade (Gilmoreosaurus (Bactrosaurus, (Shuangmiaosaurus (Telmatosaurus, (Edmontosaurus, Corythosaurus))))), the rest of styracosternans, including Morelladon, form an unresolved polytomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A second analysis was performed using the data matrix of Norman [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data matrix included 28 taxa and 105 characters (S3 Supporting Information) and was analyzed using TNT [36] using a Traditional search.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The starting trees were Wagner with a random seed of 1 and 1000 replicates: the tree bisection reconnection algorithm was used with 100 trees saved per replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of the matrix of Norman [6] recovered just one most parsimonious tree (MPT) with lengths of 314 steps [Consistency Index (CI) = 0.576, Retention Index (RI) = 0.781].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that character state 1 for character 72 (middle to posterior dorsal vertebra neural spine proportions) has been reinterpreted and recoded for tall and narrow, axial length less_than50% of height.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tree (Fig 16) recovered a similar topology to that obtained by Norman [6] and places Morelladon as the sister taxon to Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis in a clade with the topology (Iguanodon bernissartensis, (Morelladon, Mantellisaurus)) within non-hadrosauriform Styracosterna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morelladon and Mantellisaurus are united by sharing a straight (character 95, state 0), narrow and angular-sided (character 96, state 2) ischial shaft.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the tree topology of Norman [6] iguanodontoid styracosternans are recovered as the sister-clade of Hadrosauriformes (sensu Norman [6]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the tree topology obtained here differs from that reported by Norman [6] in the position of Barilium dawsoni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Barilium dawsoni is here recovered as the most basal iguanodontoid differing from the position recovered in the strict consensus tree of Norman [6] which places Barilium within an unresolved polytomy at the base of iguanodontoid styracosternans that included a clade consisting of Iguanodon bernissartensis and Mantellisaurus and a clade with the topology (Proa, (Jinzhousaurus, Bolong)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other trees derived for the analysis of Norman [6] place Barilium dawsoni as the basal taxon of a clade with the topology (Barilium, (Iguanodon bernissartensis, Mantellisaurus)) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5052 in [6]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all of these hypotheses, Barilium is a representative of the sister-clade of (Proa, (Jinzhousaurus, Bolong)) clade within the iguanodontoid styracosternans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the differences in the character and taxon sampling of the data matrices, both analyses place Morelladon close to the Barremian-lower Aptian European strycosternans Iguanodon bernissartensis and Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis, also known from the Mas de la Parreta quarry in Spain [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the limited material known from the type specimen, a suite of autapomorphies supports the validity of Morelladon beltrani.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Morelladon can be distinguished from other styracosternan iguanodontians on the basis of a unique combination of characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the phylogenetic analysis carried out, Morelladon is clearly nested within the clade that contains its synchronic and sympatric contemporary European taxa Iguanodon bernissartensis and Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis, and the lower Albian Proa valdearinnoensis from the Iberian Peninsula.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Styracosternans are by far the most abundantly represented group of dinosaurs in the Arcillas de Morella Formation including, besides Morelladon beltrani, several individuals assigned to Iguanodon bernissartensis and probably to Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the recognition of Morelladon beltrani provides a distinguishing component of the Arcillas de Morella Formation respect to its equivalent upper Wealden facies from northwest Europe (Belgium and England), also characterized by the presence of the medium-large bodied styracosternans Iguanodon bernissartensis and Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the discovery of Morelladon beltrani gen. et sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. combined with other recent named taxa (e.g., Delapparentia turolensis [2], Proa valdearinnoensis [3], Iguanodon galvensis [5]) recognizes the Iberian Peninsula as a highly diverse Early Cretaceous medium-large bodied styracosternan assemblage worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
