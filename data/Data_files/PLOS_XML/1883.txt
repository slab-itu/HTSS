A new tropical Oligocene dolphin from Montañita/Olón, Santa Elena, Ecuador  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A new small probable Oligocene dolphin from Ecuador represents a new genus and species, Urkudelphis chawpipacha.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new taxon is known from a single juvenile skull and earbones; it differs from other archaic dolphins in features including widely exposed frontals at the vertex, a dorsally wide open vomer at the mesorostral groove, and a strongly projected and pointed lateral tuberosity of the periotic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analysis places it toward the base of the largely-extinct clade Platanistoidea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fossil is one of a few records of tropical fossil dolphins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extant cetacean groups (Neoceti) originated from basilosaurid ancestors [1] during the Late Eocene [2], radiating to produce some crown family lineages by the end of the Oligocene [35].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This radiation involved an early rapid increase in morphological and ecological disparity, although the globally-sparse Early Oligocene record, with its widely mentioned preservational bias [2, 46], provides little direct support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolutionary patterns have yet to be quantified for Neoceti as a whole; meanwhile, the early increase in diversity and disparity has been shown in a total evidence phylogeny for one of the two main clades, Mysticeti [7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consider the advances in understanding the Neoceti radiation since Whitmore and Sanders' [8] historic summary of Oligocene Cetacea in the 1970s; developments have involved both theory (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  phylogenetics) and practice (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  new methods for preparation and analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To focus on odontocetes, historically-long established taxa have been redescribed using modern approaches (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xenorophus, Agorophius, Archaeodelphis) [9, 10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many new taxa have been named, adding to taxonomic and morphological diversity (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Albertocetus, Simocetus, Waipatia, Otekaikea) [9, 1115].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ecologically-important behavior, such as feeding and echolocation, has been inferred from structure using extant phylogenetic bracketing and functional morphology (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Echovenator, Cotylocara) [16, 17], with important contributions from functional complexes of living species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To consider directions for research on Oligocene Neoceti, substantial fossil collections from long-recognised productive regions (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  South Carolina, coastal Oregon to British Columbia, Hokkaido, New Zealand) include many undescribed taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most fossil Neoceti are from temperate latitudes, with equatorial and polar fossils barely known (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arktocara) [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A persistent issue is the difficulty of dating fossil Cetacea; marine biozones or absolute radiometric dates are rarely available or cited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we describe a small dolphin skull that represents a young calf from Santa Elena Province, Ecuador (Fig 1), on the margin of the eastern tropical Pacific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enough detail is preserved, especially for the ear region, to diagnose and name the specimen as a new genus and species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analysis places it near the base of the almost extinct clade Platanistoidea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fossil is one of a few cetaceans from the tropical eastern Pacific margin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hitherto, previously-reported cetacean remains from Ecuador include a fragmentary ziphiid specimen (ear bones and small pieces of mandibles) and an isolated tooth possibly belonging to a ziphiid, from the Early-Middle Miocene [19] and cetacean ribs from the Late Pliocene to Pleistocene [20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Comment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Urkudelphis chawpipacha shows these synapomorphies of the Platanistoidea (sensu Fordyce, 1994), as recognised previously by Tanaka and Fordyce [22]: periotic with C-shaped parabullary sulcus; small articular rim, which forms a ridge anterolateral to posterior process of periotic and separated from it by a sulcus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two phylogenies place Urkudelphis near the base of the Platanistoidea (sensu lato; including Platanistidae, Squalodelphis, Notocetus, Phocageneus, Otekaikea, Waipatiidae, Awamokoa and Squalodontidae [22]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

(Figs 212, Tables 1 and 2)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Holotype: MO-1, an incomplete skull (premaxilla, maxilla, vomer, pterygoid, frontal, parietal, interparietal, alisphenoid, squamosal and supraoccipital), including the right periotic, right tympanic bulla and right malleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Etymology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The generic name, Urkudelphis originates from Kichwa urku meaning mountain, referring to the type locality of Montañita, and Greek delphis for dolphin, which has been used widely as a suffix for dolphin generic names.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chawpipacha results from the combination of chawpi, meaning "half" or middle and pacha, meaning "the world" representing the equator, and thus Ecuador in Kichwa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Type_locality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MO-1 was found by one of the authors (JA) and several UPSE students in August 2015 in a boulder that collapsed from a cliff at the coastal locality here named Montañita/Olón (latitude 1°48'50.64" S, longitude 80°45'24.18" W).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Montañita/Olón (MO) locality (Fig 1) lies midway between the towns of Montañita and Olón (Santa Elena Province, Ecuador) and can only be accessed during low tides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Type_horizon_and_age  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dolphin-bearing strata at the Montañita/Olón fossil locality are composed of a moderately-sorted, fine to medium sandstone with angular quartzo-feldspathic clasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conspicuous rounded green grains are probably glauconite, but berthierine cannot be dismissed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The matrix is micritic and volcanogenic, possibly bentonitic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bedding is massive to indistinct, suggesting little influence by traction currents or storm waves, and in turn implying a quiet setting; estuarine or mid-shelf is possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rare benthic foraminifera, and a lack of planktic foraminifera, suggest an estuarine rather than a shelf environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sediments exposed in lower levels of the cliffs of Montañita/Olón are rich in fossil vertebrates (mostly cetaceans and sharks, including teeth of Carcharocles angustidens), whereas bivalves and gastropods are more abundant in the upper levels of the section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fossils are consistent with an Oligocene age, discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The published litho- and chronostratigraphy of the cetacean-bearing sediments exposed at the Montañita/Olón fossil locality is complicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different geologists have used different stratigraphic names derived from several nearby regional basins and/or fault-bounded sequences, and we give only a simple summary here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Montañita/Olón strata were reported [23] as part of the Zapotal Formation (sensu Olsson [24]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  "Zapotal" is one of nine lithostratigraphic names for what may be the same unit ([23]:129).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whittaker [25] noted errors in the key geological map including the Montañita/Olón locality [26], leading him to recognise most of the Zapotal Formation as the Progreso Formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whittaker [25] also questioned the stratigraphic relationships of the Manglaralto-Montañita area and the depositionally-separate main Progreso Basin to the south.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To consider the age of the cetacean-bearing site, Olsson [24] reported the benthic mollusks Thyasira montanita and Epitonium cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  antiguense at Montañita/Olón and assigned these sediments a "middle" Oligocene (Rupelian?)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  age based on the mollusks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later, Bristow [23] identified the Montañita/Olón strata as part of the Zapotal Member of the Tosagua Formation and of ChattianAquitanian age, reporting the presence of the supposedly Miocene nautiloid Aturia curvilineata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nielsen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [27], however, listed A. curvilineata as a junior synonym for the Eocene-Miocene nautiloid A. cubaensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whittaker [25] used the name Dos Bocas Formation, rather than Tosagua Formation, because Dos Bocas was originally used for reportedly Early Miocene strata of the neighboring Manabí Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Benítez [28] suggested that the sandstone at Montañita/Olón belongs to the Consuelo Formation, which he interpreted as late Burdigalian to early Langhian in age based on its stratigraphic position between the Villingota and Subibaja Formations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Benítez's description of lithostratigraphy is difficult to follow, and we are unsure which of his formations or ages best fits the cetacean horizon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we provisionally identify the source horizon for MO-1 as the Zapotal Member of the Dos Bocas Formation, with names following Whittaker [25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More study is needed to establish the proper terminology of the coastal strata outside, but closely-related to, the Progreso Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not find foraminiferans that might be used for dating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of Carcharocles angustidens is consistent with a late Oligocene age suggested by Bristow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elsewhere, in the East Pisco basin of Peru, C. angustidens is not reported from the vertebrate-bearing Chattian to Burdigalian Chilcatay Formation, in which the richest vertebrate-bearing horizon is Burdigalian [2931]), but occurs in older units (M. Urbina and A. Altamirano (Departamento de Paleontología de Vertebrados, Museo de Historia Natural, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos), personal communication, fide T.J. DeVries (Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, University of Washington, Seattle)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the age of MO-1 is consistent with a probable Chattian age (24 to 26 Ma), as shown by Bristow [23] (his Fig 3, Zapotal Member of Tosagua Formation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Diagnosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Urkudelphis chawpipacha is a small archaic odontocete with the following autapomorphic combination of characters: shallow antorbital notch (character 10); anteromedially oriented anterior edge of the supraorbital process (character 37); weakly dorsally convex nuchal crest in dorsoposterior view (character 119); approximately same sized apertures of the vestibular aqueduct and cochlear aqueduct (character 186); dorsoventrally thin pars cochlearis on the periotic (character 192); inner posterior prominence of the tympanic bulla is anterior to the outer posterior prominence (character 218); very strongly projecting and pointed lateral tuberosity; and an anteroposteriorly long accessory ossicle of the periotic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urkudelphis chawpipacha differs from early branching odontocetes, including Agorophius, Ashleycetus, Simocetus, Mirocetus and Xenorophus in having the frontals on the vertex at a level behind the postorbital process; anteroposteriorly shorter and transversely wider frontals (approaching a square-shape rather than narrow and elongate); and parallel-sided posterior part of the ascending process of each maxilla forming a narrow elongate face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urkudelphis differs from Early Miocene Papahu taitapu, Chilcacetus cavirhinus, Arktocara yakataga, Allodelphis pratti and Ninjadelphis ujiharai, having the frontals on the vertex flat and longer than the taxa above, which have more nodular and shorter frontals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urkudelphis differs from Chilcacetus and Papahu in having a narrow premaxillary sac fossa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urkudelphis chawpipacha also notably shows: frontals at the vertex invaded posteriorly by the interparietal; and long anteromedial projection of the palatine on the palate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other diagnostic features of U. chawpipacha are shared with more-crownward Waipatiidae: a shallow suprameatal pit of the squamosal (character 152); an abruptly ventrally deflected anterior process of the periotic (character 172); and a nearly flat dorsal surface of the periotic in lateral view (character 181).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Urkudelphis chawpipacha shares several characters with more-crownward Platanistoidea: a periotic with C-shaped parabullary sulcus (character 175); and a small articular rim, which forms a ridge anterolateral to the posterior process of the periotic and separated from it by a sulcus (character 195).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_relationships  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phylogenetic position of MO-1 was analyzed using the matrix of Tanaka and Fordyce [38], which was originally derived from Tanaka and Fordyce [13], slightly modified as below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expanded Tanaka & Fordyce [38] matrix includes 83 extant and extinct named and described taxa; one taxon, OU 22125, was recently named as Awamokoa tokarahi, while another, OU 22670, is not formally described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  284 characters (with 31 soft tissue characters) are cited and/or modified from previous studies [11, 3955].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The percentage of missing data of MO-1 is 61% (including soft tissue characters) and 56% (excluding soft tissue characters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the earbones are well coded; the periotic shows 33 of 34 characters (97%) and the tympanic bulla 10 of 19 characters (53%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data are provided as supporting information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3 Files show the data matrix in nexus and TNT formats respectively; S4 File is the character list, and S5 File lists modified codings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S7 Files are tree files for analyses 1 and 2 respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2 Figs show the full trees, which were used to produce the trees with collapsed clades of Fig 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Character data and tree data were managed using Mesquite version 2.75 [55].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two different analyses were performed with TNT version 1.5 [56].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All characters were treated either as unweighted and unordered (analysis 1), or with implied weights [57] with K = 3 and unordered (analysis 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outgroup was the protocetid Georgiacetus vogtlensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both analyses used New Technology Search with the setting: recover minimum length trees = 1000 times with a backbone constraint of extant taxa, based on the topology of the McGowen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [58] molecular phylogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ease of illustrating, species in some taxa among the Delphinida (Inioidea, Phocoenidae and Delphinidae) were collapsed after the analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both analyses 1 and 2 placed MO-1 in the Platanistoidea [11], and as basal to Awamokoa tokarahi (Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis 1 shows a clade of Waipatia spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  + Otekaikea spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  + A. tokarahi and MO-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, analysis 2 shows the latter species (Waipatia spp., Otekaikea spp., A. tokarahi and MO-1) not forming a clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ontogeny_and_phylogenetics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specimen MO-1 is interpreted as a juvenile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies on living cetacean species have shown marked ontogenetic change in some parts of the skull, particularly the feeding apparatus (rostrum, temporal fossa), e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [33, 59] One might expect comparable ontogenetic change in the size and shape of bones and the skull in fossil cetaceans, with implications for cladistic coding and phylogenetic placement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In living odontocetes, the periotic ossifies early in fetal development [60], and generally shows little change in size or shape after birth [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, this single element is feature-laden [21], with many characters available for cladistic analysis and/or identification to species level [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the Urkudelphis periotic provides 34 characters, including apomorphies for major nodes in the Platanistoidea (Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where possible, the periotic and/or tympanic bulla should be used particularly in phylogenetic analyses of suspected juvenile specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_with_other_Oligocene_dolphins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phylogenetic analyses show that Urkudelphis is distinct from other named genera of odontocetes in skull and earbone features, some of which are noted below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urkudelphis differs from Oligocene basal odontocetes (Ashleycetus, Xenorophus, Agorophius, Squaloziphius, Simocetus and Mirocetus), in the structure of the vertex: the large frontals have a nearly-square exposure on the vertex, associated with a parallel-sided ascending process of the maxilla, as in some more-crownward Late Oligocene and Neogene dolphins (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  especially Waipatia; see also Otekaikea, Iniopsis [62], and Eosqualodon [63]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But, the Late Oligocene Patriocetus kazakhstanicus [64] differs in having large frontals with an anteriorly narrower and posteriorly wider exposure on the vertex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MO-1 differs from other named Late Oligocene dolphins in its larger frontals at the vertex, and a dorsally wide open vomer forming a mesorostral groove reminiscent of Ashleycetus [65] and Xenorophus [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also of note in Urkudelphis is the interparietal, which invades the posterior of the frontals at the vertex, and the palatine, which projects forward into the maxilla in the ventral midline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparable palatine condition occurs more strongly in Simocetus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urkudelphis differs from Early Miocene Papahu taitapu, Chilcacetus cavirhinus [66], Arktocara yakataga [18], Allodelphis pratti [67, 68] and Ninjadelphis ujiharai [69], having the frontals on the vertex are flatter and longer than the taxa above, which have more nodular and shorter frontals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urkudelphis differs from Chilcacetus and Papahu in having a narrow premaxillary sac fossa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antorbital notch of Urkudelphis is very shallow, which is different from Patriocetus, Xenorophus, Prosqualodon, Squaloziphius [70], Chilcacetus and Ninjadelphis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urkudelphis does not preserve the nasal, but the frontal shows shallow fossae probably for thin nasals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparable condition can be seen in Chilcacetus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Urkudelphis periotic is similar to that of the Late Oligocene Waipatia maerewhenua, Otekaikea spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Awamokoa tokarahi, in its slender and ventrally bent anterior process and anteroposteriorly long elliptical internal acoustic meatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MO-1 differs from Waipatia and Otekaikea spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in a weakly curved parabullary sulcus similar to that of Awamokoa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the Platanistoidea, the Urkudelphis periotic uniquely shows approximately the same size of the aperture for vestibular aqueduct and cochlear aqueduct (character 186), and can be diagnosed using a combination of two ear bone characters: a thin pars cochlearis of the periotic (character 192); and a posterior edge of the medial prominence of the involucrum located anterior to the posterior edge of the lateral prominence (character 218).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong lateral tuberosity in MO-1 is even stronger than the prominent tuberosity in Awamokoa and Allodelphis pratti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allodelphis, and the other Early Miocene Allodelphinidae (Ninjadelphis and Arktocara) differ, however, in many aspects of skull morphology; for example, the pterygoid sinus fossa is anteroposteriorly longer, and the posterior portion of the premaxillae dorsoventrally thin and narrow, separated by narrow nasals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tympanic bulla of MO-1 lacks a prominent anterior spine, the presence of which has been proposed as a synapomorphy of the Platanistoidea [71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the spine has an uncertain ontogeny, and also may often be damaged; thus, its state is uncertain in early platanistoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Waipatia maerewhenua shows an incipient anterior spine, while Awamokoa tokarahi and Otekaikea spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  have a damaged bullar apex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the tympanic bulla in some living delphinids has a small spine, which lengthens with ontogeny, although not to the length seen in Platanistidae [61].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Urkudelphis malleus is similar to that of Huaridelphis in its slender manubrium, contrasting with the blunt manubrium in Notocetus vanbenedeni [71], and Eurhinodelphis cocheteuxi [48].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zarhachis [72], Phocageneus venustus and Pomatodelphis cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  inaequalis [72] differ from Urkudelphis in their pointed manubrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Urkudelphis malleus has large facets for the incus compared with other dolphins (such as Delphinida in Muizon [72] and Notocetus, Phocageneus and Pomatodelphis in Muizon [71]), but compared to Inticetus vertizi [30], it is smaller.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Paleoenvironment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the Late Cretaceous to Eocene, the Ecuador region was tectonically active with substantial crustal translation and rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the later Oligocene to Neogene, Andean tectonics included forearc subsidence and localised basin development, but no great latitudinal displacement of the Montañita/Olón fossil locality (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [73]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Urkudelphis probably lived in a near-equatorial setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the habitat was estuarine or neritic (mid-shelf waters) is uncertain, so we cannot consider paleoecology; besides, the Urkudelphis skull is not preserved well enough to interpret functional complexes such as the feeding and hearing apparatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the late Oligocene, the Central American Seaway was open, probably with major equatorial currents ([74] Figs 7 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other tropical-latitude cetacean fossils have been reported recently from South America, including aforementioned Neogene material from Ecuador [19, 20], Chile [75] and Peru [7678].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mio-Pliocene cetaceans, including species of Mysticeti, Iniidae and Platanistidae, were reported recently from Colombia and Venezuela [79], adding to material reported from Costa Rica, Panama, and other South American localities noted by Aguirre-Fernández et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [79].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A new small dolphin from probable Oligocene (Chattian?)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  strata in Santa Elena, Ecuador is described as a new species and genus, Urkudelphis chawpipacha.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new taxon is characterized by: an anteromedially oriented anterior edge of the supraorbital process; weakly convex nuchal crest in dorsoposterior view; approximately same sized apertures of vestibular aqueduct and cochlear aqueduct; dorsoventrally thin pars cochlearis on periotic; and inner posterior prominence placed anterior to the outer posterior prominence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urkudelphis chawpipacha differs from other Oligocene dolphins in the combination of: frontals on the vertex at a level posterior to the postorbital process; shorter and wider frontals; and parallel-sided posterior part of the ascending process of the maxilla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analysis places it near the base of the largely-extinct clade Platanistoidea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fossil is one of few fossil Neoceti reported from the equator, and is a reminder that Oligocene cetaceans may have ranged widely in tropical waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
