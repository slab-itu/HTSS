Attenuation of Na/K-ATPase Mediated Oxidant Amplification with pNaKtide Ameliorates Experimental Uremic Cardiomyopathy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously reported that the sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na/K-ATPase) can effect the amplification of reactive oxygen species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we examined whether attenuation of oxidant stress by antagonism of Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification might ameliorate experimental uremic cardiomyopathy induced by partial nephrectomy (PNx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNx induced the development of cardiac morphological and biochemical changes consistent with human uremic cardiomyopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both inhibition of Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification with pNaKtide and induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) with cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) markedly attenuated the development of phenotypical features of uremic cardiomyopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a reversal study, administration of pNaKtide after the induction of uremic cardiomyopathy reversed many of the phenotypical features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attenuation of Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification may be a potential strategy for clinical therapy of this disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown that the plasmalemmal Na/K-ATPase has a signaling function in addition to and distinct from its pumping function1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also demonstrated that this signaling function may amplify oxidants and increase cellular oxidant stress; conversely the blockage of this signal cascade with a designed peptide, pNaKtide, may attenuate oxidant stress4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we have recently shown that pNaKtide antagonizes the cellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to several stimuli in a dose-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo in models of adipogenesis and obesity4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the induction of HO-1 with a variety of agents has also been shown to attenuate oxidant stress8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with chronic kidney disease are at great risk for cardiovascular disease events and mortality and develop the clinical phenotype called uremic cardiomyopathy12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As oxidant stress is a constant feature of both clinical14 and experimental uremic cardiomyopathy15, we reasoned that increased detoxification of oxidants by HO-1 induction as well as attenuation of Na/K-ATPase signaling mediated oxidant amplification with pNaKtide might ameliorate the phenotypical changes in experimental uremic cardiomyopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

TCB is a cardiotonic steroid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found the TCB (100nM, 24h) induced increases in type I procollagen (procollagen-1) expression (Fig 1A, pless_than0.01 vs. control).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of HO-1 with CoPP (5M, 24h) and inhibition of Na/K-ATPase signaling with pNaKtide (1M, 1h) did not significantly affect procollagen-1 expression at baseline but significantly ameliorated TCB induced increases in procollagen-1 expression (Fig 1A, both pless_than0.01 vs. TCB alone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although TCB treatment increased HO-1 expression, the effects of CoPP on HO-1 induction were considerably greater (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The administration of pNaKtide had a small effect on HO-1 expression which did not attain statistical significance and appeared to be substantially less than that achieved by CoPP (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCB also induced activation of c-Src (Fig 1C) and ERK1/2 (Fig 1D) as well as oxidant stress as assessed by protein carbonylation (Fig 1E); these measurements were also attenuated by pretreatment with either CoPP or pNaKtide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_pNaKtide_and_CoPP_on_PNx-mediated_cardiac_dysfunction_and_hemodynamic_changes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As this model of experimental renal failure does not induce significant increases in blood pressure (BP) in this mouse strain16,17, BP measurements were reported only in the Supplementary Materials (details in Supplementary Materials, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither PNx, CoPP nor pNaKtide appeared to have substantial effects on BP in this experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, although PNx was associated with impaired renal function, neither CoPP nor pNaKtide resulted in substantial changes in either plasma cystatin C, creatinine, or urea nitrogen in the setting of PNx (Supplemental Materials, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PNx resulted in the consistent development of cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction as assessed by echocardiographic methods, summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, PNx increased the ventricular wall thickness and mass (anterior wall thickness (AWT), posterior wall thickness (PWT), relative wall thickness (RWT), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI)) as well as the myocardial performance index (MPI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These increases were significantly attenuated by either pNaKtide or CoPP treatment (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither pNaKtide nor CoPP had significant effects as measured by echocardiography in sham treated mice (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, PNx induced profound anemia which was substantially alleviated by concomitant administration of pNaKtide, but not CoPP (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in heart weight/body weight ratio with PNx was also markedly attenuated by pNaKtide but not CoPP (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_pNaKtide_and_CoPP_on_PNx-induced_cardiac_fibrosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Administration of either pNaKtide or CoPP to sham surgery treated animals did not significantly affect the degree of cardiac fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNx surgery was accompanied by marked degrees of cardiac fibrosis as assessed by Sirius Red/Fast Green staining (pless_than0.01 vs. Sham alone) which was significantly attenuated by pNaKtide or CoPP treatment (Fig 3A, both pless_than0.01 vs. PNx alone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the morphological changes, PNx significantly increased collagen-1 expression in left ventricle (LV) homogenates assayed by Western blot (Fig 3B, pless_than0.01 vs. Sham alone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administration of either pNaKtide or CoPP reduced PNx-induced increases in LV collagen-1 expression (Fig 3B, both pless_than0.01 vs. PNx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CoPP induced HO-1 expression most profoundly, PNx alone also induced HO-1 expression in the LV homogenates (Fig 3C, pless_than0.01 vs. PNx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At 4 weeks after PNx surgery, a significant activation of c-Src (Fig 3D, pless_than0.01 vs. Sham alone) and ERK1/2 (Fig 3E, pless_than0.01 vs. Sham alone) was observed in LV homogenates in the PNx group that was attenuated in those PNx animals treated with CoPP or pNaKtide (Fig 3D,E, both pless_than0.01 vs. PNx alone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to the sham group, PNx stimulated protein carbonylation, an oxidative stress marker, in LV homogenates (Fig 3F, pless_than0.01 vs. Sham alone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administration of either CoPP or pNaKtide significantly reduced PNx-induced protein carbonylation (Fig 2F, both pless_than0.01 vs. PNx alone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipid peroxidation data assessed by Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) of LV homogenates were consistent with the carbonylation data as expected (Supplemental Materials, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Administration_of_pNaKtide_reversed_PNx_induced_uremic_cardiomyopathy-reversal_study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In another set of animals, PNx was performed and mice were allowed to develop uremic cardiomyopathy for 4 weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the fifth week post PNx, pNaKtide was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of either 0, 1, 5, 10 or 25mg/kg body weight on day 0, day 2, and day 4, and the mice were sacrificed on day 7 of that week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood pressure measurement and echocardiography were performed both before pNaKtide treatment and sacrifice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, BP data were not different, and we report these data in the supplement (Supplementary Materials, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did note that pNaKtide appeared to reverse anemia and cardiac hypertrophy based on heart weight/body weight ratio, the latter in a dose dependent manner (Fig 4A,B, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these animals, we observed that many (but not all) of the echocardiographic features of uremic cardiomyopathy were reversed by pNaKtide in a dose dependent fashion after one week (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, left ventricular wall thickness (anterior, posterior and relative wall thickness) as well as left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were ameliorated by pNaKtide at the higher doses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The myocardial performance index (MPI) changes, which were also ameliorated by pNaKtide in the earlier study, were not reversed by pNaKtide in this reversal study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are summarized in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The administration of pNaKtide at higher doses also reversed the fibrosis in a dose dependent manner as assessed by histology (Fig 5A) and collagen-1 expression (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with pNaKtide also attenuated cardiac c-Src activation (Fig 5C) and ERK1/2 activation (Fig 5D) as well as oxidant stress as assessed by protein carbonylation (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administration of higher doses (10 and 25mg/kg for plasma creatinine or 25mg/kg for BUN, respectively) of pNaKtide reversed PNx-mediated increases in plasma creatinine and BUN, but not plasma cystatin C (Supplementary Materials, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Systemic oxidant stress is certainly part of the uremic syndrome18, and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the cardiac abnormalities seen with the syndrome called uremic cardiomyopathy19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously demonstrated oxidant stress in experimental uremic cardiomyopathy, a phenomenon which we have attributed to elevated levels of cardiotonic steroids (CTS) which serve as ligands and activators for the Na/K-ATPase22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this point, we have seen that antagonism of these CTS through active or passive immunization and through pharmacological strategies is effective at ameliorating physiological, morphological, and biochemical features of uremic cardiomyopathy in rodents24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On this background, we sought to examine whether blockade of Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification with pNaKtide, an agent which does not affect the pumping function of the Na/K-ATPase, could also effectively ameliorate the phenotypical features of uremic cardiomyopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used CoPP induction of HO-1 to examine whether this was dependent on the specific blockade of Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification or whether it was a consequence of attenuating the oxidant stress itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data clearly showed that either pNaKtide or CoPP ameliorated the physiological, morphological, and biochemical alterations of uremic cardiomyopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the improvement of oxidant stress with either of these two agents resulted in improved left ventricular diastolic function and decreased hypertrophy, less cardiac fibrosis, and less evidence for Na/K-ATPase signaling and ROS stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease is associated with poor outcome, increased cardiovascular disease and mortality27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, amelioration of the anemia associated with chronic renal failure was noted with pNaKtide but not CoPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect this may be related to different effect durations these agents might have in different tissues, but additional work to understand this is critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the murine cardiac fibroblast system, we noted that decreasing oxidant stress with either pNaKtide or CoPP attenuated Na/K-ATPase signaling and collagen production to comparable degrees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further examined the effects of pNaKtide on established cardiac changes in this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that pNaKtide reversed cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, changes in MPI with PNx, an index of systolic and diastolic function28 which were prevented by weekly administration of pNaKtide were not affected by the week of pNaKtide therapy in animals with established uremic cardiomyopathy at any dose studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This either indicates that the functional change(s) measured with MPI are recalcitrant to reversal, or pNaKtide was administered for inadequate time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again surprisingly, we found that one week of pNaKtide administration significantly improved established anemia in our model of experimental renal failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We believe these data are of interest for several reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it suggests a somewhat different interpretation of the chicken or the egg argument regarding oxidant stress and inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some excellent work suggests that the oxidant stress in chronic kidney disease results from inflammation presumably due to various uremic toxins18, our data suggest that signaling through the Na/K-ATPase may actually produce the initial oxidant stress which initiates recruitment of inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second and probably more importantly, our data suggest that therapy that allows for the attenuation of oxidant stress can ameliorate phenotypical features of uremic cardiomyopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As cardiac mortality is markedly elevated in patients afflicted with advanced renal disease29, this suggests the ultimate possibility of effective therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that neither HO-1 induction nor pNaKtide represent oxygen radical scavengers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both strategies involve dynamic attenuation of oxidant stress by decreased production and/or increased detoxification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the clinical administration of reactive oxygen scavengers has been largely disappointing30, this distinction is not trivial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental_design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Male C57BL/6 mice (1012 weeks old) were purchased from Hilltop Lab Animals Inc. (Scottsdale, PA) and housed in pathogen free animal facility in designated rooms equipped with cages that supply purified air under a 12-hour light/dark cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Food and water were supplied ad libitum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal care and experiments were approved by the Marshall University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of animals in each group was determined by power analysis following assumptions derived from our previous study with mice22, using a variance of 0.2 within the groups, power of 0.80, and alpha error of 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

5_6_Nephrectomy_Mouse_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PNx model utilized a two-step surgical approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Step-one, instead of partial resection of both poles as reported elsewhere16,22, the superior and inferior poles of the left kidney were ligated to avoid bleeding, in a manner that approximately only 1/3 of the left kidney mass was left functional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Step-two surgery was operated 7 days later, in which the right kidney was removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sham surgery, the two-step surgeries were performed in the same way as in the PNx group, without ligation of the left kidney and removal of right kidney.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the in vivo study I, animals were sacrificed 4 weeks after the step-two surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the in vivo study II, animals were given either vehicle or pNaKtide beginning at 4 weeks post-surgery for one week and sacrificed at 5 weeks post-surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Administration_of_pNaKtide_and_CoPP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the in vivo study I, pNaKtide was dissolved in sterile PBS buffer and administrated (25mg/kg BW) by intraperitoneal injection weekly, starting one week after step-two surgery up until the point of sacrificing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CoPP was prepared in Tris-NaOH buffer (25mM Tris, pH 7.88.0) and administrated (5mg/kg BW) by intraperitoneal injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CoPP injections were given 5 days prior to, and on the day of, surgery, as well as every 5 days thereafter until sacrificing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the in vivo study II, pNaKtide was administered at 0, 1, 5, 10 and 25mg/kg 3 times a week beginning at the end of week 4 post-surgery and sacrificed at the end of the additional week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Blood_Pressure_(BP)_measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were first conditioned in restrainers for at least five days prior to the first BP reading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BP measurements were performed with CODA 8-Channel High Throughput Non-Invasive Blood Pressure System (Kent Scientific, Boston, MA) both one day before step-one surgery, and one day before sacrifice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transthoracic_Echocardiography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed 24hours before sacrifice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light anesthesia was achieved by continuous inhalation of isoflurane (1.52.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice in supine position were placed on a heating pad to keep the body temperature at 37°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Core body temperature and electrocardiogram (ECG) for physiological monitoring were obtained and manipulated by using VisualSonics Mouse Handling Table (11436) and rectal thermometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Echocardiographic images were captured using MS400: 1838MHz operating frequency MicroScan transducer attached to a Vevo 1100 Imaging System (FUJIFILM VisualSonics Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Warmed echo gel was placed between the probe and shaved chest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B-mode and M-mode images of the heart were obtained from parasternal long axis and short axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pulsed-Wave Doppler and Color Doppler were obtained from basal short axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average values were calculated from at least four consecutive cardiac cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Left-ventricular end-diastolic area (EDA), end-systolic area (ESA), as well as main pulmonary artery diameter was measured from B-mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  End-diastolic diameters (EDD), end-systolic diameters (ESD), as well as anterior and posterior wall thickness (AWT & PWT) were captured from M-mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isovolumic contraction and relaxation time (IVCT & IVRT), ejection time (ET), as well as pulmonary velocity time integral (VTI) were obtained from PW and color Doppler.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the following parameters were calculated with the equation below: myocardial performance index (MPI)=(IVCT+IVRT)/ET, relative wall thickness (RWT)=(PWT+AWT)/EDD, cardiac output (CO)=stroke volume (SV)×HR/1000, fractional shortening (FS)=(EDDESD)/EDD, ejection fraction (EF)=(EDVESV)/EDV and the left ventricular mass index (LVMI)=1.05[(EDD+PWT+AWT)3EDD3]/Body weight (g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sirius_Red_Fast_Green_staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Histological staining for collagen fibers was perform on tissues harvested with Sirius Red/Fast Green Collagen Staining solutions (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) according to manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue preparation, fixation, and data analysis were conducted as previously described25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blotting_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cardiac (left ventricle, LV) tissue samples and cardiac fibroblast homogenates were prepared and analyzed as we previously described for collagen-125 and other proteins5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assessment of protein carbonylation and activation of c-Src and ERK1/2 was performed as we described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple exposures were analyzed to assure that the signals were within the linear range of the film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal density was determined using NIH ImageJ 1.48v software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polyclonal antibody against type I collagen was from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polyclonal anti-Src [pY418] phospho-specific antibody was from Invitrogen (Camarillo, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monoclonal antibody against total c-Src was from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) and antibody against 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) hydrazone derivatives were from Sigma-Aldrich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_design_for_in_vitro_experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C57BL/6 mouse primary cardiac fibroblast cells (purchased from Cell Biologics, Inc., Chicago, IL) were re-suspended in complete fibroblast medium with supplements and 10% FBS (Cell Biologics, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cultures were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator and the medium was changed after 48h and every 2~3 days thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cardiac fibroblast cells (passage 34) were grown until over confluent and were serum-starved (with 1% FBS) overnight before being used for the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were treated with or without TCB (100nM) to determine collagen-1 and HO-1 expression (24h treatment), and c-Src and ERK1/2 activation and protein carbonylation (1h treatment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the effect of HO-1 induction and Na/K-ATPase signaling, some cells were pre-treated with CoPP (5M, 24h) or pNaKtide (1M, 1h) before TCB treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_plasma_cystatin_C__creatinine_and_blood_urea_nitrogen_(BUN)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Mouse cystatin C ELISA kit and creatinine kit were obtained from Crystal Chem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inc. (Downers Grove, IL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Mouse BUN ELISA kit was obtained from MyBioSource Inc. (San Diego, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were performed following manufactures instruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was done in duplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data were tested for normality and then subjected to parametric analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When more than two groups were compared, one-way ANOVA was performed prior to comparison of individual groups, and the post-hoc t-tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Holm correction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical significance was reported at the Pless_than0.05 and Pless_than0.01 levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were performed with the IDE RStudio for the R (version 3.2.5) software (from http://www.rstudio.org and https://www.R-project.org)31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pirate plot was used to form graphs, in which the raw data points, full densities of each group, and Bayesian 95% Highest Density Intervals (HDIs) are plotted33 (please see Supplemental Materials, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HDIs are calculated using the BEST package in R34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values in tables are given as mean±SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
