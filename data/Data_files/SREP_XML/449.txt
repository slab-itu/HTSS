Turning the fate of reprogramming cells from retinal disorder to regeneration by Pax6 in newts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The newt, a urodele amphibian, has an outstanding ability even as an adult to regenerate a functional retina through reprogramming and proliferation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, even though the neural retina is completely removed from the eye by surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains unknown how the newt invented such a superior mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that disability of RPE cells to regenerate the retina brings about a symptom of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), even in the newt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When Pax6, a transcription factor that is re-expressed in reprogramming RPE cells, is knocked down in transgenic juvenile newts, these cells proliferate but eventually give rise to cell aggregates that uniformly express alpha smooth muscle actin, Vimentin and N-cadherin, the markers of myofibroblasts which are a major component of the sub-/epi-retinal membranes in PVR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our current study demonstrates that Pax6 is an essential factor that directs the fate of reprogramming RPE cells toward the retinal regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The newt may have evolved the ability of retinal regeneration by modifying a mechanism that underlies the RPE-mediated retinal disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to other vertebrates including humans, the newt (a group of urodele amphibians classified into the family of Salamandridae) can regenerate, even as an adult, an entire retina from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In adult vertebrate eyes, the RPE is a highly differentiated monolayer-cell-sheet laminating the back of the neural retina (NR) and functions as a partner of the NR for vision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mature RPE cells, as a rule, do not proliferate under physiological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the adult newt, RPE cells in the intact eye are also mitotically inactive, but when the NR is removed from the eye by surgery (retinectomy), RPE cells lose their epithelial characteristics and detach from each other as well as from the basement membrane (Bruchs membrane), giving rise to the aggregates of mesenchymal-like cells with multipotency, named RPE stem cells (RPESCs), in the vitreous cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPESCs are subsequently divided into two cell populations which undergo proliferation, so that they can differentiate in the correct polarity into two epithelial layers of progenitor cells (named pro-NR and pro-RPE layers) that eventually regenerate new functional NR and RPE, respectively3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It remains unknown how such a sophisticated mechanism for retinal regeneration evolved in the newt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be difficult to understand this mechanism solely by the mechanisms underlying RPE-to-NR transdifferentiation which can be induced in a restricted time frame during embryonic development in amniotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, the RPE does not lose its epithelial characteristics, but directly switches into the neuroepithelium while preserving its original polarity, giving rise to the NR with inverse polarity while losing the RPE2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, our recent studies revealed a similarity in early behaviour of RPE cells between adult newt retinal regeneration and human retinal disorders such as proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR)3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In PVR, when the NR suffers a wound from a traumatic injury, RPE cells  as in the newt  start to lose their epithelial characteristics while acquiring the ability to migrate and proliferate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike in the newt, these cells eventually transform into myofibroblasts, a major component of both the epi- and sub-retinal membranes which close the wound of the NR, but finally withdraw the NR by contraction, leading to a loss of vision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this process of transformation (classified as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, or EMT), it has been suggested that RPE cells pass through a multipotent state4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such multipotent RPE cells in humans, which were also named RPESCs, are regarded as the cells corresponding to the newt RPESCs3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Perhaps, in the newt something may have happened in early processes of retinal disorders like PVR during evolution, so that the fate of RPESCs was directed toward retinal regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this is the case, when retinal regeneration in the newt is impaired in early processes, symptoms of PVR would become apparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we examined this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we created for the first time a transgenic newt enabling RPE-targeted gene regulation and successfully hindered retinal regeneration by knocking down the expression of Pax6 in RPESCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pax6 is a transcription factor which is re-expressed in RPESCs and then up-regulated in the pro-NR layer while down-regulated in the pro-RPE layer3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conditional_RPE-targeted_gene_knockdown_system  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We created transgenic newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster) to specifically express shRNA as well as a fluorescent reporter protein mCherry in both mature RPE cells and cells that originate from those RPE cells after retinectomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These animals carried DNA encoding either control shRNA (C-shRNA) or Pax6 shRNA (Pax6 shRNA-2), which was located between the stop codon and the polyA terminal in the mCherry gene (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These shRNAs were examined in our previous study3, and Pax6 shRNA-2 proved to effectively inhibit Pax6 expression in this species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we used juvenile newts around 7 months old (12 months after metamorphosis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were incubated at the swimming larva stage (St. 5859; around 4 months old) in a rearing solution containing 4M (Z)-4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) for 48h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this condition, Cre-mediated recombination leading to mCherry-shRNA expression was almost restricted in the central area of the RPE in metamorphosed newts (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3): in juvenile newts around 7 months old, more than 70% of the cells in the central RPE (45°135°) and less than 30% of the cells in the peripheral RPE were mCherry+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, all transgenic newts used in this study displayed no abnormalities in eye development or in NR/RPE morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Retinal_regeneration_in_the_control_condition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the control condition with C-shRNA, retinal regeneration occurred normally (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We carried out retinectomy in ~7 months old juveniles (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the eyes at ~2 months post operation (po) when the retina had regenerated (Stage L-2), mCherry fluorescence was observed in both the NR and the RPE (Fig 1b,c) as anticipated from our previous study3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the NR, the mCherry+ area was restricted to the centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known in growing eyes of juvenile newts that retinal stem/progenitor cells at the periphery of the NR (i.e., the ciliary marginal zone; CMZ), which is reserved from embryonic eye development, are still active, and their contribution to regeneration (or regrowth) of peripheral NR is very high compared to the adult5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, also in our newts, a cell layer of the CMZ grew quickly toward the centre along the RPE upon retinectomy and met a pro-NR layer which formed slowly from the central RPE (Fig 1df), eventually regenerating a large part of the NR (7090% of its radius) while the remnant central NR was regenerated from the RPE (see the schematic in Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participation of the peripheral RPE in the retinal regeneration was probably inhibited by association with the cell layer growing quickly from the CMZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the central NR, mCherry fluorescence was observed in all kinds of retinal neurons and glia (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular cases, we recognized a column structure of NR cells (Fig 1c and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, it resembled a column of descendants which originate from a single retinal progenitor cell in embryonic retinal development7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is sufficient for us to believe that a single RPE-derived pro-NR cell is capable of producing one set of NR cells, being comparable to the retinal progenitor cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Retinal_regeneration_in_the_Pax6_knockdown_(Pax6_KD)_condition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the Pax6 KD condition, obvious abnormalities appeared in the behavior of RPE cells as regeneration proceeded beyond Stage E1 (typically 10 days po) when RPE cells had become mesenchymal-like cells, which start to express Pax6 in normal retinal regeneration3,10 (Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the eyes on 26 days po, when the thickness of a regenerating NR originating from the CMZ (CMZ-NR) had increased (Stage I-1 to I-2), lightly pigmented cells expressing mCherry, i.e., RPE-derived cells, gathered in between the leading ends of the CMZ-NR (Fig 2a,b; see the schematic in Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike in the control condition, these cells were not integrated into one continuous regenerating NR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that Pax6 expression in those cells had been efficiently blocked (see Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On 50 days po when the CMZ-NR, in which the plexiform layers had just appeared (Stage I-3 to L-1), started fusing at its leading ends so that a hole in the centre of the regenerating NR closes, such Pax6-less (Pax6) RPE-derived cells had moved out to the vitreous cavity, creating a fibrous structure along the vitreal surface of the NR (Fig 2c,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the proliferative activity of the RPE-derived cells (Fig 2df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells in the centre of the RPE mostly re-entered the cell cycle by Stage E1 and proliferated (Fig 2e), although activity decreased to ~80% of the control, and the cells derived from those RPE cells, i.e., Pax6 RPE-derived cells, mostly exited the cell cycle by 26 days po (Fig 2d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pax6 RPE-derived cells at this stage had lost the RPE marker, RPE65 (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, Pax6 KD hardly altered dedifferentiation (loss of original characteristics) and proliferation of RPE cells, but seriously impacted their transdifferentiation into the NR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regeneration of the central RPE was also observed later than 26 days po (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, pigmented cells along or near Bruchs membrane did not express mCherry (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we observed Pax6 immunoreactivity in those cells on 50 days po (Fig 2c), indicating that the central RPE originated from the cells in which Cre-mediated recombination did not take place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that most of those cells migrated from the margin of the surrounding RPE, whose participation in NR regeneration was inhibited by tissue that originated from the CMZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, on 26 days po, cells in the prospective central RPE exhibited RPE65 immunoreactivity as in the surrounding RPE, and those cells were cycling as were the cells in the margin of the surrounding RPE (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, Pax6 RPE-derived cells did not contribute to the renewal of RPE (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results demonstrated that Pax6 expression in RPE-derived cells was essential for them to regenerate both the NR and the RPE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Appearance_of_epi-_sub-retinal_membrane-like_phenotype_by_Pax6_KD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We addressed whether impairment of retinal regeneration by Pax6 KD in RPE cells resulted in the appearance of symptoms of RPE-mediated retinal disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human PVR, RPE cells undergo EMT, giving rise to myofibroblasts, which are a major component of the sub- and epi-retinal membranes4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, using immunohistochemistry, we examined the expression of markers of RPE-derived myofibroblasts, such as alpha smooth muscle actin (aSMA), Vimentin and N-cadherin4,11, in Pax6 RPE-derived cells (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, aggregates of Pax6 RPE-derived cells, which had migrated from their original place on Bruchs membrane and gathered in between the leading ends of the CMZ-NR, expressed aSMA, Vimentin and N-cadherin uniformly (Fig 3ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further examined the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), another marker of epi- and sub-retinal membranes4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFAP immunoreactivity was localized in fibroblastic cells near the leading ends of the CMZ-NR (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells may have migrated from regenerating NR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFAP is known to be expressed in both retinal progenitor cells and Müller glia cells12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In PVR, Müller cells in an injured NR also contribute to the epi- and sub-retinal membranes4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, Pax6 KD in RPE-derived cells resulted in a structure with a similar phenotype to the epi- and sub-retinal membranes (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we successfully hindered RPE-originating retinal regeneration in the newt by knocking down Pax6 in RPE-derived cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We must note here that in the juvenile eyes examined, the contribution of the CMZ to retinal regeneration was so high that the area in which RPE-originating retinal regeneration took place was restricted to the central retina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Pax6 KD condition, RPE-derived mesenchymal-like cells were able to migrate and proliferate but eventually differentiated into cells like myofibroblasts, suggesting that the newt RPE cells underwent EMT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, cellular components of the resulting structure were similar to those of epi- and sub-retinal membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, inhibition of the retinal regeneration resulted in the appearance of symptoms of RPE-mediated retinal disorders like PVR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possibly, adult newts may have invented the ability of retinal regeneration by revising the program underlying EMT of RPE cells upon retinal trauma, so that the fate of RPESCs is directed toward the retinal regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, in the newt, Pax6 is an essential player for this process with a novel function enabling RPESCs to self-organize into two progenitor layers (epithelium) which eventually regenerate the NR and the RPE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a previous study, we demonstrated that Pax6 KD in embryonic development resulted in a missing eye in the newt, suggesting that the function of Pax6 as a master regulator of eye morphogenesis is also conserved in this animal3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we examined the function of Pax6 in a different context, i.e., retinal regeneration from terminally differentiated RPE cells, that is unique to this animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, comparison with eye development may be helpful to understand Pax6 function in this system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous study, we proposed that RPESCs might substantially correspond to the cells in the early optic vesicle although RPESCs preserved their original characteristics3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we hypothesized, as an analogy to optic cup formation, that Pax6 might have a role in the fate decision of RPESCs to differentiate either the NR or the RPE as the cells formed two progenitor layers10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the current study, we demonstrated that in the Pax6 KD condition, RPE-derived cells differentiated into neither the NR nor the RPE, but rather into myofibroblast-like cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that Pax6 is essential for RPE cells to be reprogrammed into normal RPESCs which have the potency to differentiate into both the NR and the RPE (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In speculation, RPE cells might substantially dedifferentiate to the state near the eye field from which the optic vesicle is formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this, the time point at which Pax6 functioned at first was earlier than anticipated, and therefore the previous hypothesis was not evaluated in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we know that once RPESCs are generated, they undergo regulation of Pax6 and are sorted into two cell populations3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One population in which Pax6 is up-regulated forms the pro-NR layer, while the other population forms the pro-RPE layer3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the function of Pax6 in cell fate decision is reasonable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in this stage a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET)-like event takes place in both progenitor layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Pax6 KD system can target RPESCs, and therefore we will pursue this issue in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It would be difficult to understand by comparison with eye development how normal reprogramming by Pax6 prevents RPE cells from transforming into myofibroblast-like cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This issue would be of mature RPE cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pax6 may function even as a key factor that revises a default program which is booted in mature RPE cells after retinal injury and leads them to EMT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It must be noted here that Pax6 may be expressed in human RPESCs which give rise to myofibroblast cells in PVR3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the newt, something might have happened in RPE cells during evolution so that Pax6 can work properly for retinal regeneration while inhibiting EMT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further understanding of how Pax6 works in reprogramming RPE cells in the adult newt in comparison with the homologous system in humans is necessary not only to uncover the changes that occurred in the newt during evolution but also to unlock the potency of in vivo retinal regeneration from RPE cells in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings would lead, in the future, to a novel clinical treatment of RPE-mediated retinal disorders that inhibits the EMT of RPE cells while promoting retinal regeneration in the eyes of patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All methods were carried out in accordance with Regulations on the Handling of Animal Experiments in University of Tsukuba (RHAEUT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experimental protocols were approved by Committee for Animal Experiments in University of Tsukuba (CAEUT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Toride-Imori, a race of the Japanese fire-bellied newt C. pyrrhogaster, was used for this study13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fertilized eggs were obtained from adult animals (total body length: male, ~9cm; female, 1112cm)13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developmental stages were determined according to previous criteria13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transgenesis_for_RPE-targeted_Pax6_knockdown  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To block the expression of Pax6 in both mature RPE cells and cells originating from those RPE cells after retinectomy, two plasmids, pRPE65 greater than CreERT2-CAGGs greater than YFP (I-SceI) and pCAGGs greater than [AmCyan]mCherry-shRNA (I-SceI), were constructed based on cpRPE65-mcherry0114 and pCAGGs-mCherry-shRNA (Sce)3 using standard molecular cloning procedures (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pRPE65 greater than CreERT2-CAGGs greater than YFP (I-SceI), the C. pyrrhogaster RPE65 promoter, which is specifically activated in RPE cells as they reach terminal differentiation14, was used to drive the expression of an inactive form of Cre recombinase CreERT2, and a fluorescent protein YFP, which is expressed under the control of a ubiquitous promoter CAGGs13, was used to monitor the transgenic state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pCAGGs greater than [AmCyan]mCherry-shRNA (I-SceI), a gene of the fluorescent protein AmCyan (Z2440N; Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) was flanked by loxP sites, and a DNA sequence encoding Pax6 shRNA-2 or control shRNA (C-shRNA) was inserted between the stop codon and the polyadenylation terminal in a gene of the other fluorescent protein mCherry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of the activated Cre, AmCyan expression, which is driven by CAGGs and was monitored to evaluate the transgenic state, is switched to mCherry-shRNA expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design and specificity of shRNA have been described in our previous paper3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both plasmids, the transgene cassette was flanked by I-SceI meganuclease recognition sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chicken -globin HS4 2× core insulator was inserted into the cassette to minimize possible cis interactions within the cassette and between the cassette and functional elements on the chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HS4 insulator was a kind gift from Dr. Gary Felsenfeld (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transgenesis was carried out using the I-SceI protocol13 (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two plasmids (described above) and I-SceI enzyme (catalogue #R06945; New England Biolabs, Tokyo, Japan) were co-injected into one-cell stage embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Components of the injected solution (4nl per embryo) were as follows: pRPE65 greater than CreERT2-CAGGs greater than YFP (I-SceI), 40ng l1; pCAGGs greater than [AmCyan]mCherry-shRNA (I-SceI), 40ng l1; I-SceI, 1U l1; I-SceI buffer (New England Biolabs), 1X; phenol red, 0.01%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The injected embryos were incubated until the 4-cell stage at 12°C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the embryos reached the blastula stage (St. 10), the animals that expressed both YFP and AmCyan in their entire body almost evenly were screened under a fluorescence dissecting microscope (M165 FC; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were reared until the swimming larva stage (St. 5859) at 22°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leaky expression of mCherry was not detected during development (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To induce Cre-mediated recombination, when swimming larvae reached St. 59 (just before metamorphosis), they were transferred into 0.1X Holtfreters solution13 (pH 7.4) containing 4M 4-OHT [(Z)-4-hydroxytamoxifen; Sigma-Aldrich, MO 63103, USA] and 1% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and incubated for 48h at 22°C in the dark (the solution was exchanged to a fresh solution after 24h incubation) (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the control, animals were incubated in 0.1X Holtfreters solution containing 1% (v/v) DMSO only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 4-OHT treatment, animals were transferred into 0.1X Holtfreters solution at 22°C until metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metamorphosed juveniles were transferred into moist chambers and reared until surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Anesthesia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Juvenile newts were anesthetized in water containing 0.05% (v/v) FA-100 (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol; DS Pharma Animal Health, Osaka, Japan) for 15min at 20°C in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anesthetized animals were rinsed in distilled water and air dried on moist paper towels until surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Retinectomy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Juvenile newts around 7 months old (12 months after metamorphosis; total body length: 3.54.0cm) were subjected to surgical removal of both the lens and the neural retina under anesthesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were placed under a dissecting microscope (M165 FC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dorsal half of the eye was cut open along the corneal-scleral junction, and the neural retina was carefully removed together with the lens1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After surgery, animals were allowed to recover and kept in moist chambers at 20°C until experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue_preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eyeballs were carefully removed from animals under anesthesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fragment of the dorsal eyelid was left on the eyeballs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For direct observation of reporter fluorescence (mCherry, Cyan, and YFP), eyeballs were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 6h at 4°C (Fig 1b,c and Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that this fixation condition was too strong to detect gene expression by immunohistochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunohistochemistry, eyeballs were fixed in modified Zambonis solution [2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.2% (w/v) picric acid in PBS (pH 7.4)] for 6h at 4°C (Fig 2, Fig 3 and Supplementary Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in this condition, reporter fluorescence was diminished, while red autofluorescence sometimes appeared along the outer segments of photoreceptors and red blood cells in the choroid (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fixed eyeballs were thoroughly rinsed in PBS at 4°C (5min×3, 10min×3, 30min×3, 1h×3, and overnight), transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C and incubated until the eyeballs were completely submerged (79h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were embedded into Tissue-Tek O.C.T compound (4583; Sakura Finetek USA, CA 90501, USA) and cryosectioned at ~20m thickness along the dorsoventral axis1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-Pax6 antibody (1:200; AD2.38, sc-32766; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TX 75220, USA), anti-RPE65 antibody (1:500; MAB5428; EMD Millipore, CA 92590, USA), anti-Vimentin antibody [Vim 3B4] (1:250; ab28028; Abcam, Tokyo 1030012, Japan) and Cy3 conjugated anti-GFAP antibody (1:600; G-A-5-Cy3; C9205; Sigma-Aldrich); rabbit polyclonal anti-RFP antibody (for mCherry; 1:200500; 600-401-379; Rockland Immunochemicals, PA 19468, USA), anti-aSMA antibody (1:500; ab137734; Abcam) and anti-N Cadherin (1:400; ab12221; Abcam); human PCNA autoantibody1 (1:1000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary antibodies were as follows: Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (1:500; A11001; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Yokohama, Japan), anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody (1:500; A11034; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and anti-human IgG antibody (1:1,000; A11013; Thermo Fisher Scientific); tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:250; T2762; Thermo Fisher Scientific); Rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated affiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody (1:500; Code: 111-025-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, PA 19390, USA); biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:250; BA-9200; Vector Laboratories, CA 94010, USA) and anti-rabbit IgG (1:250; BA-1000; Vector Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For immunofluorescence labeling3, eyeball sections were washed (PBS, 15min  0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, 15min  PBS, 15min), incubated with blocking solution [2% normal goat serum (S-1000; Vector Laboratories), 5% bovine serum albumin (A3294-50G; Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS] for 2h, and then incubated with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were washed and then incubated with secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 4h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize autofluorescence, eyeball sections were sometimes treated with 0.3% H2O2 in 50% methanol diluted in PBS for 20min before they were incubated with blocking solution (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunoperoxidase labeling3, eyeball sections were washed, treated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 20min, washed, incubated in blocking solution mixed with Avidin D (1:50; Avidin/Biotin Blocking kit; SP-2001; Vector Laboratories) for 2h, washed twice in PBS, and then incubated in primary antibody diluted with blocking solution mixed with Biotin (1:50; Avidin/Biotin Blocking kit) overnight at 4°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were washed, incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 4h, washed, incubated in a mixture of Avidin and Biotin Complex (1:50 each; Vectastain ABC Elite kit; PK-6100; Vector Laboratories) for 2h, washed, and then treated with DAB solution (DAB substrate kit; SK-4100; Vector Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After labeling, tissues were washed and sometimes bleached3 (Fig 2b,c and Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were counterstained to visualize nuclei with either DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; 1:25,000; D1306; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TO-PRO-3 Iodide (1:10,000; T3605; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and finally mounted with 90% glycerol in PBS or Vectashield mounting medium (H-1000; Vector Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Transgenic newts were monitored under a fluorescence dissecting microscope (M165 FC) which was installed with filter sets specific to AmCyan (CFP; Exciter: 436/20nm; Emitter: 480/40nm; Leica Microsystems), YFP (YFP; Exciter: 500/20nm; Emitter: 535/30nm; Leica Microsystems) and mCherry (Exciter: XF1044, 575DF25; Emitter: XF3402, 645OM75; Opto Science, Tokyo, Japan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were taken by a digital camera system (EOS Kiss x7i; Canon, Tokyo, Japan) attached to the microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eyeball sections were examined on a fluorescence microscope (BX50; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) which was also installed with the same filter sets as well as standard filter sets for EGFP, Texas red and DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their images were taken by a charge-coupled device camera system (DP73; cellSens Standard 1.6; Olympus) attached to this microscope (BX50; Olympus) or by a confocal microscope system (LSM510; LSM 5.0 Image Browser software; Carl Zeiss, Germany).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were analyzed with software for the image acquisition systems and in Photoshop CS5 Extended (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figures and panels were prepared using Photoshop CS5 Extended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images, brightness, contrast and sharpness were adjusted according to the journals guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_counting_and_statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To count the number of PCNA+ RPE-derived cells (Fig 2df), eyeball sections were double-labelled with antibodies against PCNA and RPE65, and stained with To-pro-3 to visualize cell nuclei (see above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were carefully examined for their immunoreactivities by confocal microscopy (see above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCNA-immunoreactive nuclei were counted in all nuclei (To-pro-3 stained) of RPE-derived cells on 10 days [Stage E-1; these cells were still RPE65+ in both Pax6 KD and control conditions (Fig 2e)], and in all nuclei of RPE-derived cell aggregates in between the leading ends of CMZ-NR on 26 days po [these cells were either RPE65 or RPE65+ (Fig 2f)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in PCNA immunohistochemistry under the current conditions using juvenile eyes, non-specific binding of primary antibody sometimes occurred in the intercellular space within regrowing NR from CMZ (CMZ-NR) and in the extracellular matrix surrounding RPE cells migrating from the ends of regrowing RPE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For statistics, a section containing aggregates of RPE-derived cells was selected per eyeball at random from those around the centre of the eyeball, and the cell count data from the section was used as representative data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were collected from at least three eyeballs in both the control and test conditions, and presented as the mean±SE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical differences between the control and test was evaluated by a Students t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
