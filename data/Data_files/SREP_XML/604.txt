Transparent polycrystalline cubic silicon nitride  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Glasses and single crystals have traditionally been used as optical windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, there has been a high demand for harder and tougher optical windows that are able to endure severe conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transparent polycrystalline ceramics can fulfill this demand because of their superior mechanical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that polycrystalline ceramics with a spinel structure in compositions of MgAl2O4 and aluminum oxynitride (-AlON) show high optical transparency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the synthesis of the hardest transparent spinel ceramic, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  polycrystalline cubic silicon nitride (c-Si3N4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This material shows an intrinsic optical transparency over a wide range of wavelengths below its band-gap energy (258nm) and is categorized as one of the third hardest materials next to diamond and cubic boron nitride (cBN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the high temperature metastability of c-Si3N4 in air is superior to those of diamond and cBN, the transparent c-Si3N4 ceramic can potentially be used as a window under extremely severe conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are two known polymorphs of Si3N4 at ambient pressure: - and -Si3N4 with hexagonal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter requires higher temperatures than the former to be synthesized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Practically, most Si3N4 polycrystalline materials are fabricated using -Si3N4-rich powders and a part of the -Si3N4 transforms into -Si3N4 during sintering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the sintered bodies, the -Si3N4 grains frequently have elongated shapes with aspect ratios comparable to whiskers that act to toughen the material1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the Si3N4 sintered bodies are whisker-reinforced ceramics, which makes this material useful in industry as parts of reciprocating engines, ball bearings, and cutting tools1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these two phases, silicon atoms are fourfold (tetrahedrally) coordinated by nitrogen atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
c-Si3N4, which is often called -Si3N4, is stable under high pressure with a spinel structure2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this structure, two thirds of the silicon atoms are sixfold (octahedrally) coordinated and the rest are fourfold coordinated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sixfold coordination results in a significantly closer atomic packing and density almost 26% higher than those of the hexagonal phases3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  c-Si3N4 is known to be synthesized above ~13GPa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3) and has been a candidate as a superhard material4,5 that has a Vickers hardness value above 40GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanical properties have not yet been well-constrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this article, we report the synthesis of the bulk polycrystalline form of c-Si3N4 with a grain size of ~150nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the sintered samples, all the elastic moduli (bulk, shear, Youngs modulus, and Poissons ratio) were determined; Vickers hardness and fracture toughness were measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the obtained bulk polycrystalline form exhibits high optical transparency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations were performed to elucidate the mechanism to make this material transparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We carried out synthesis runs at three different temperatures of 1600, 1700, and 1800°C at a fixed pressure of 15.6GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The starting material was commercially available -Si3N4 powder whose oxygen content is less than 2wt%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phases present in the recovered samples were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample synthesized at 1600°C consists mainly of c-Si3N4 but the XRD peaks of - and -Si3N4 were also observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the hexagonal phases may be explained by a kinetic hindrance of the transformation to c-Si3N4 at relatively lower temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This recovered sample was loosely sintered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples synthesized at 1700 and 1800°C consist of a single phase of c-Si3N4 and they are well-sintered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These samples look translucent and transparent, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We determined a unit cell parameter of c-Si3N4 using an XRD pattern of a sample synthesized at 1800°C: a=7.7373±0.0006Å, which is consistent with that determined in a previous study (a=7.7381±0.0002Å)3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bulk density of this polycrystalline sample was measured to be 4.07±0.08g/cm3, which is also consistent with a theoretical density3 of 4.022g/cm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result supports the fact that the sample consists of a single phase of c-Si3N4 and indicates that the porosity of this sintered sample is negligibly small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we measured the bulk chemical composition of this sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values we obtained are as follows: Si, 60.1±0.3wt%; N, 37.1±0.4wt%; O, 2.5±0.2wt%; Total, 99.7±0.5wt%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are very close to the calculated values for the stoichiometric Si3N4 (Si, 60.06wt%; N, 39.94wt%) and an oxygen-bearing -phase6, Si11.5N15O0.5 (Si, 59.69wt%; N, 38.83wt%; O, 1.48wt%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Figure 1a shows a photograph of a recovered sample synthesized at 1800°C, and it is transparent pale gray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A letter on a ruler behind the sample is clearly seen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real in-line transmission7 (RIT) was measured as a function of wavelength (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these measurements, all light that is scattered at an angle 0.3° is not detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the RIT is a good measure for the visual transparency7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RIT of this sample is 1838% for visible light (wavelength of 400800nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can see the presence of a weak and broad absorption at a wavelength of 500700nm, which may cause the pale grey color of this sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The very low RIT values up to 300nm can be related to the bandgap energy of 258nm (=4.8±0.2eV)8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed the microstructure of the transparent polycrystalline c-Si3N4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a shows an example of the bright-field TEM images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of equigranular texture was observed and the average grain size is 143±59 (one standard deviation) nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No residual pore and no triple pocket was observed at multi-grain junctions (Fig 2b), which is consistent with the results of the density measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the c-Si3N4 grains have straight grain boundaries and they are almost dislocation-free, which is consistent with the presence of sharp peaks in the XRD patterns (Supplementary Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atomic-resolution STEM observations at grain boundaries between two grains show the presence of disordered/amorphous intergranular films9 (IGFs) with a thickness of less than 1nm (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements at the IGFs and grain interiors show that oxygen atoms preferentially segregate to the IGFs (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Atomic resolution STEM observations were also performed at multi-grain junctions (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the thickness of IGFs near the multi-grain junctions (~1nm) is similar to that between two grains, which causes the absence of triple pockets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elemental mappings of silicon, nitrogen, and oxygen (STEM-EDS, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) confirmed that oxygen atoms segregate to the IGFs and revealed that the IGFs consist of silicon oxynitride (Fig 3bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The very thin IGFs and the absence of triple pockets could be the reasons for the optical transparency of the bulk polycrystalline c-Si3N4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scattering of incident light is caused by the following factors10: (1) optically inhomogeneous materials with secondary phases that have different refractive indices; (2) not isotropic crystals by birefringence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of triple pockets (no second phase) and the cubic spinel structure (MgAl2O4 spinel11 and -AlON (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12), which are known as popular transparent ceramics, have the same crystal structure) causes small scattering losses resulting in the optical transparency of bulk polycrystalline c-Si3N4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although - and -Si3N4 phases are intrinsically transparent because of the wide bandgaps13 (single crystals of -Si3N4 were reported to be transparent)14, the Si3N4 sintered compacts that consist of - and -phases look opaque1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the sintering at lower pressures (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hot-pressing), sintering aids such as MgO, SiO2, and Al2O3 are required to obtain the toughened and highly densified compacts1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, MgO reacts with silicon and oxygen in the system and the magnesium silicate is molten under high temperature; after cooling, it remains mainly in triple pockets as an amorphous phase1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in the case of sintered -Si3N4 ceramics without additives, the presence of amorphous triple pockets was observed15 and their dimensions are several tens to several hundreds of nanometers16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemical composition of the -Si3N4 grains is nearly pure Si3N4 and that of the amorphous triple pockets is SiO2 with a small amount of nitrogen16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the -Si3N4 cannot incorporate the impurities into its structure, the formation of the triple pockets may be inevitable as reservoirs of additives and impurities in the sintered bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The refractive index of the amorphous phase in the triple pockets can be different from those of the crystalline phases (- and -phase with hexagonal symmetry), which causes scattering of the incident light resulting in opaque sintered bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the other hand, it has been reported that some polycrystalline -SiAlONs exhibit optical transparency17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These materials are isostructural with -Si3N4, in which silicon and nitrogen are partially substituted by aluminum and oxygen (Si3N4-based solid solutions)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incorporation of the additives into the structure produces little or no triple pocket, which causes small scattering losses of light resulting in optical transparency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism may be applied to the case of the transparent c-Si3N4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of triple pockets in this material (Fig 3a) indicates that at least a part of the oxygen impurities is incorporated into the c-Si3N4 structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The composition of the hypothetical oxygen-bearing c-Si3N4 may be inferred by analogy from that of -Si3N4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was reported that -Si3N4 contains oxygen in its crystal structure, which could be explained by nitrogen vacancies with electrical neutrality being obtained by an appropriate number of silicon vacancies or Si3+ species1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compositions suggested are Si23N30O or Si4+20Si3+4N30O, respectively, which are similar to the compositions of the starting material and the transparent c-Si3N4 ceramic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, aluminum oxynitrides with a spinel structure (-AlONs) contain cation vacancies18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in Al23O27N5 spinel, 8 Al3+ occupy all the tetrahedral sites and 15 Al3+ occupy octahedral sites with 1 vacancy18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the cation vacancy model (Si23N30O) might be preferable for the hypothetical oxygen-bearing c-Si3N4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actually, our EELS spectrum at grain interior might show the presence of oxygen in the structure (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The silicon and nitrogen vacancies might cause the pale grey color of this transparent c-Si3N4 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of oxygen incorporation into c-Si3N4 and the resultant optical transparency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to show a potential of the transparent c-Si3N4 ceramic as a hard and tough window, the mechanical properties of this material were measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since it is optically transparent, Brillouin scattering was performed to measure longitudinal and transverse wave velocities (VP and VS, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained VP=12.55km/s and VS=7.84km/s with estimated errors of 0.5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we can calculate all the elastic moduli at ambient conditions using the theoretical density3 of 4.022g/cm3: bulk modulus (B), 303.4±4.0GPa; shear modulus (G), 247.5±1.0GPa; Youngs modulus (E), 583.8±10.1GPa; Poissons ratio (), 0.1793±0.0056.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison with previous results5,19,20,21,22 is shown in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vickers indentation tests were carried out at indentation loads between 0.196 and 19.6N to measure the Vickers hardness (HV) and evaluate the fracture toughness (KIc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4a shows the indentation load dependence of HV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HV decreases with indentation load to an asymptotic value beyond 5N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed HV=34.9±0.7GPa at 9.8N as a representative value of this material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison with previous results4,5 is also shown in this plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6-Mar-2017 11:376-Mar-2017 11:376-Mar-2017 11:376-Mar-2017 11:376-Mar-2017 11:376-Mar-2017 11:37 4b shows an indentation load dependence of KIc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average of all the measured values is 3.5±0.2MPa·m1/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transparent c-Si3N4 is tougher than transparent MgAl2O4 spinel (KIc~1.7MPa·m1/2)23 and -AlON (KIc~2.4MPa·m1/2)23, and is as tough as polycrystalline alumina, which is a popular structural ceramic in industry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained mechanical properties and comparison with previous results4,5,20,21,22,24,25 are also shown in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to compare the hardness of c-Si3N4 with those of other materials, we have updated a plot proposed by Teter26, HV vs. G (Fig 4c, the details are shown in supplementary information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  c-Si3N4 is as hard as and elastically stiffer than B4C and B6O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These three materials are in the group of the third hardest materials (not superhard materials) next to diamond and cBN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The polycrystalline c-Si3N4 shows intrinsic transparency (Fig 1b): no strong light absorption at wavelengths below its bandgap energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diamond is the hardest material and the synthesis of transparent nano-polycrystalline diamond (NPD) was reported27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NPD shows its characteristic brownish color, which is given by a continuous absorption at wavelengths between 500 and 700nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This absorption could be attributed to lattice defects induced by plastic deformation during the synthesis process28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This material also shows strong continuous absorption at wavelengths between 225nm (band gap energy) and 450nm, which is attributed to electron transitions from nitrogen (impurity) to the conduction band28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, NPD is transparent, but does not show its intrinsic transparency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polycrystalline cBN materials have been reported to be translucent29; B4C and B6O materials are opaque.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the polycrystalline c-Si3N4 is nearly color-less and the second hardest ceramic window (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transparent polycrystalline c-Si3N4 can potentially be employed in industry to protect optical sensors and detectors under severe conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the advantages of this material is an excellent thermal metastability in air24, at least up to 1400°C, which is superior to that of diamond, cBN, and other hard materials30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, one of the limitations of this material for industrial applications is the small size of the bulk material because of synthesis under high pressure above 13GPa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this article, we reported the synthesis of the transparent disks with diameter of ~2mm (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If one of the worlds largest high-pressure instruments is employed for the synthesis, transparent c-Si3N4 disks with diameter larger than 10mm can be synthesized31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centimeter-sized transparent disks can be used in industry as windows for small devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Starting_material_and_the_container_for_synthesis_under_high_pressure_and_temperature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The starting power was commercially available -Si3N4 powder (SN-E10, Ube Industries, Ltd., Ube, Japan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the product catalog, the proportion of the -phase is 95wt%; the oxygen content is less_than2wt%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; the specific surface area is 913m2/g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The as-received powder was dried in an oil-free vacuum oven (~8hPa) at 200°C for ~12hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dried powder was enclosed in a sample capsule made of a platinum sleeve and disks, which were embedded into an outer MgO sleeve with MgO lids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before loading the sample, the platinum and MgO parts were heated at 1000°C for ~10min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After loading the sample, the assembled sample container was dried again in the vacuum oven at 150°C for more than 2hours before the synthesis runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Synthesis_under_high-PT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-pressure and high-temperature synthesis experiments were performed using a Kawai-type apparatus, installed at DESY, with a Walker-module (mavo press LPR 1000-400/50; Max Voggenreiter GmbH, Mainleus, Germany).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum force of this instrument is 1000 tonf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second stage anvils were tungsten carbide cubes with a truncated edge length of 7 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Cr2O3-doped magnesia octahedron with an edge length of 14mm was used as the pressure transmitting medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cylindrical LaCrO3 furnace (Nikkato Corp., Osaka, Japan) was employed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sample container made of platinum and MgO was embedded into the furnace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details are shown in Supplementary information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

XRD_measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
XRD patterns of the recovered samples were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer with Cu-K radiation (MiniFlex-600; Rigaku, Japan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were also carried out at the P02.1 in PETRA III, Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-rays monochromatized by a (111) diamond and a (111) silicon crystal in Laue geometry with an energy of ~60keV were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incident beam-size was 300×300 m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transmission geometry and a two-dimensional detector (XRD 1621, PerkinElmer) were employed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample-to-detector distance (~900mm) and the detector orthogonality were calibrated using the diffraction pattern for cerium dioxide powder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bulk_density_and_chemical_composition_measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Density of a recovered sample was measured with an AccuPyc II 1340 pycnometer, using He gas displacement and mass measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical composition of the recovered sample was measured using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accelerating voltage, current, and working distance was 20kV, 1nA, and 10mm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the data collection, the electron beam was scanned over the surface of the sample in the area of ~1m×~1m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data aquisition time was 20s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standards employed for elemental quantifications were as follows: Si, SiC; N, cBN; O, SiO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polished surface of the recovered sample was coated with osmium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Light_transmission_measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Real in-line transmission of a recovered sample was measured in the wavelength range of 240 and 1600nm using a double-beam spectrophotometer (SolidSpec-3700DUV, Shimadzu, Japan), installed at NIMS, equipped with an integrating sphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diameter of light at the sample is about 0.8mm and an aperture with diameter of 2mm was used at the entrance of the integrating sphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance between the sample and the aperture is 550mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top and bottom surfaces of the disk-shape sample were polished using diamond pastes down to 1m and the thickness is 0.464mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TEM_observations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For conventional BF-TEM and electron diffraction observations were carried out by JEM 2010HC (JEOL Ltd.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For atomic-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, we used an aberration-corrected STEM of ARM 300CF (JEOL Ltd.), installed at University of Tokyo, equipped with a JEOL ETA corrector, a cold field-emission gun, Gatan Quantum ER EELS spectrometer, and a JEOL silicon drift detector for EDX spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The used illumination semi-angle is 24 mrad and the ABF- and ADF-detector is spanning 1224 and 80200 mrad, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used dual-EELS mode to simultaneously acquire core-loss and zero-loss spectra (the energy dispersion is 0.25eV per channel) and the energy drift was corrected via post processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We operated the STEM at 300kV with typically 20pA beam current, where no significant beam damage was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grain size of the sample was determined by direct measurement of 100 grains that appear black (satisfying the Bragg condition) in a conventional BF-TEM image32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Brillouin_scattering_measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Elastic wave velocities were measured using the Brillouin system, installed at University of Bayreuth, employing 532nm laser light, a multi-pass tandem Fabry-Perot interferometer and an avalanche photodiode for signal detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were performed in symmetric forward scattering geometry using a scattering angle of 80°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectrum collection times were about 5minutes at a laser power of 70mW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hardness_and_fracture_toughness_measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HV was measured using a microhardness indenter (HM-221, Mitsutoyo) installed at DESY.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hard steel standard with 900 HV was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holding time under the indentation load is 15s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HV was calculated using the following equation: HV=1854.4P/d2, where P is the applied load (N) and d is the arithmetic mean of the two diagonals (m) of a Vickers indentation trace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KIc was calculated from the crack length, c, using the following equation: KIc= (E/HV)1/2 (P/c3/2), where E is the Youngs modulus (GPa) and  is a calibration constant of 0.016 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knoop hardness (HK) was measured using the same instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The applied load was 0.1969.8N with a holding time of 15s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
