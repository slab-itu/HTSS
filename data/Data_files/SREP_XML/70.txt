G recruitment systems specifically select PPI and affinity-enhanced candidate proteins that interact with membrane protein targets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial for the vast majority of biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously constructed a G recruitment system to screen PPI candidate proteins and desirable affinity-altered (affinity-enhanced and affinity-attenuated) protein variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methods utilized a target protein fused to a mutated G-protein  subunit (Gcyto) lacking the ability to localize to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the previous systems were adapted to use only soluble cytosolic proteins as targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, membrane proteins have been found to form the principal nodes of signaling involved in diseases and have attracted a great deal of interest as primary drug targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe new protocols for the G recruitment systems that are specifically designed to use membrane proteins as targets to overcome previous limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These systems represent an attractive approach to exploring novel interacting candidates and affinity-altered protein variants and their interactions with proteins on the inner side of the plasma membrane, with high specificity and selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are attracting increased attention in drug discovery studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PPIs have functions in the regulation of cellular states involved in various diseases1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, membrane-mediated PPIs play central roles in vital biological processes and are prime drug targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, tumorigenesis is often the result of gene mutations that lead to alterations in membrane PPIs and aberrant signaling cascades3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the molecules that control (inhibit or activate) these membrane PPIs can be used as drug candidates, rapid and unbiased screening of these molecules is essential for drug development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The major targets of membrane proteins are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, transporters, receptor serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases4,5 (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)6,7, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)8,9, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)10,11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracellular domains of these transmembrane proteins are commonly targeted to identify agonistic and antagonistic ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recently developed drug therapies have increasingly targeted the intracellular domains (kinase domains) of these transmembrane proteins to control interactions with the components of downstream signaling cascades12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, membrane-associated proteins, such as guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein), small GTPases, kinase proteins and other signal transducers, hold enormous potential for use in the development of novel drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a representative example, protein kinases are responsible for the reversible phosphorylation of proteins via PPIs and have a strong relationship with growth, infiltration and apoptosis in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A multitude of these membrane-associated proteins are involved in various diseases and are often associated with the inner side of the plasma membrane13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several kinase and GTPase inhibitors have been developed in the pharmaceutical industry14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, intracellular antibodies (intrabodies), which can inhibit signal transducers, including membrane-associated proteins, have been studied as valuable tools for controlling PPIs inside cells17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, molecules that can control the PPIs of transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins on the inner side of the plasma membrane have a potential to become an important group of drug targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Various useful screening systems for PPIs exist and have yielded significant findings20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These techniques are required for screening of large numbers of proteins and are preferable in the in vivo cellular context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, yeast two-hybrid systems are the typical tools for such screening of candidate proteins in vivo24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, split-ubiquitin system is a well-established, useful technique to screen the candidate proteins with the PPIs for membrane target proteins28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in other yeast systems, small G-protein-based methods, including the Sos recruitment system and the Ras recruitment system, are occasionally used to study the PPIs of membrane proteins23,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These methods remain useful alternatives to the original two-hybrid system; however, they suffer from technical complexities, such as the different temperatures required for growth and screening (25°C and 36°C), slow growth at suboptimal temperatures, obligatory replica-plating steps (glucose to galactose medium), and the total time required for the procedure (~7 days including precultivation)32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)35, protein fragment complementation assays using split-GFP and split-luciferase36,37,38,39,40 are useful tools for detecting the association of two proteins in living cells and have the potential to resolve these limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the varied systems used, growth reporters are generally applicable to library screening because of their convenience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previously developed screening method using yeast heterotrimeric G-proteins, called the G recruitment system41,42,43, also makes it possible to screen PPIs between a target protein and candidate proteins by the mating growth assay without false-positive clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of the mechanism utilized for detecting PPIs are presented below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The G recruitment system for detecting PPIs is based on the fundamental principle that yeast pheromone (mating) signaling requires the localization of a complex consisting of the - and -subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (G/G) to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In yeast, the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) undergoes a conformational change after binding ligands and then activates heterotrimeric G-proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activated G-proteins trigger the dissociation of the G/G complex from G concurrently with the exchange of GDP/GTP on the G subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The G subunit (complexed with membrane-associated G) then acts upon the effectors, thereby activating the downstream signaling cascade for mating44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, localization of the G/G complex to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane via the lipidation motif of the G subunit is required for initiating G-protein signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our G recruitment system specifically makes use of a cytosolic truncated variant of G (named Gcyto) that is fused to a soluble target protein of interest, X (Gcyto-X), as shown in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the library, the candidate proteins (Y1) should be attached to the artificial lipidation site to ensure localization to the membrane (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When an interaction occurs between target X and candidate Y1, the Gcyto-X fusion protein brings G to the membrane and induces subsequent activation of the pheromone signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The promoted signaling can be detected by a fluorescent reporter assay or a mating growth assay after growth in simple glucose media at the optimal temperature (30°C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the expression of GFP under the control of a pheromone-responsive FIG1 promoter or mating with intact haploid cells of the opposite mating type permits the detection of PPIs (Fig 1A and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the localization of Gcyto in the cytosol completely prevents this signaling activation, the G recruitment system allows for extremely reliable, low-background growth screening that excludes false-positive candidates at the optimal temperature (30°C)42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The procedures for screening involve simply mixing the different mating-type cells (recombinant a-cells and intact -cells) and plating on selective media (~4 days including precultivation) (Fig S1; right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advanced system (competitor-introduced G recruitment system), which additionally expresses an interaction competitor protein (Y2) in the cytosol (Fig 2A), can offer highly selective screening for protein variants whose affinities have been intentionally altered to exceed the set threshold41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is applicable to selectively screening affinity-enhanced or affinity-attenuated protein variants by exchanging the positions of the competitor protein and the library proteins (Y1 and Y2)41,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The localization of G is of key importance for the low background of the G recruitment system42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The previous G recruitment system was limited to using only soluble cytosolic proteins as the target (X), as candidate proteins (Y1) should be expressed on the membrane (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The competitor-introduced system also had a similar problem, restricting the target X to cytosolic proteins (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these previous systems could not target membrane proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we have reevaluated the G recruitment system by changing the localization of target proteins from the cytosol to the membrane; however, the prior protocol did not work well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the aim of expanding the applicability of the system, we considered new protocols for the G recruitment systems that might be suitable for evaluating membrane proteins as targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The updated method allows the G recruitment system to be used in the analysis of both cytoplasmic and membrane target proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selection_of_candidate_proteins_interacting_with_membrane_protein_targets_using_a_previously_established_PPI-detecting_G_recruitment_system  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we tested whether the previous G recruitment system could target membrane proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the previous system, the Fc protein of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the Z domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (ZWT)46 were used for the PPI models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several Z variants (ZWT, ZK35A, ZI31A and Z955) with varied affinities for the Fc protein were also used for the PPI models (ZWT, 5.9×107 M1; ZK35A, 4.6×106 M1; ZI31A, 8.0×103 M1; and Z955, none)47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the previous system, target protein X was set to localize to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (previously, target X was fused to Gcyto in the cytosol), and candidate protein Y1 was fused to Gcyto (previously, candidate protein Y1 was artificially localized to the inner leaflet of the membrane) (Fig 1A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the fictive model of target protein X, the Fc fragment was fused to the lipidation motifs in this study (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was also notable that the lipidation motifs were fused to the Fc fragment at both the N-terminus (Gpa1p motif; Gpa1N) and the C-terminus (Ste18p motif; Ste18C) to test the accessibility between the Fc fragment and the Z variants (the C-terminal Ste18p motif was used to express the Z variants as the candidate Y1 proteins described in the previous study) (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the models of Y1 proteins for the candidate library, the Z variants were fused to the C-terminus of Gcyto to express Gcyto-Y1 fusion proteins in the cytosol (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To express the target membrane proteins, the genes encoding the Fc fragment attached to artificial lipidation motifs were stably integrated into the ste18 locus of an a-type haploid yeast chromosome, resulting in MC-FC and MC-FN yeast strains (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the candidate proteins, autonomous replication plasmids for the expression of the four different Z variants (ZWT, ZK35A, ZI31A and Z955) fused to Gcyto (Gcyto-Y1) (pGK413-G-EZWT, pGK413-G-EZK35A, pGK413-G-EZI31A and pGK413-G-EZ955) (Table 2) were introduced into the MC-FC and MC-FN yeast cells (Fig 3A and Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometric analysis of the transformants was conducted after incubation in medium containing the -alpha-cell mating pheromone (-factor) (Fig S1; left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The engineered yeast strains expressing the Gcyto-ZWT and Gcyto-ZK35A fusion proteins as candidates slightly induced the transcription of GFP reporter genes via interaction with the membrane-associated Fc fragment, although the fluorescence levels were extremely low (Fig 3B and Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mating selection with intact -type yeast cells (Fig S1; right), the strains expressing Gcyto-ZWT and Gcyto-ZK35A exhibited specific but negligible cell growth on selective medium (Fig 3C and Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both GFP transcription assays and mating growth selection, interactions of Gcyto-ZI31A (very low affinity for Fc) and Gcyto-Z955 (negative control) with the membrane-associated Fc fragment were not detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results showed that the previous protocol was not sufficient to screen the interactions between membrane-associated target X and candidate Y1-fused Gcyto proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PPI-detecting_G_recruitment_system_for_the_selection_of_candidate_proteins_interacting_with_membrane_protein_targets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we tested the new protocol, in which we changed the method used to introduce the Gcyto-Y1 candidate genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA cassettes for cytosolic expression of the Gcyto-fused candidate Z variants (ZWT, ZK35A, ZI31A and Z955) as a library were stably integrated into the MC-FC and MC-FN yeast chromosomes, generating FC(FN)-GW, FC(FN)-GK, FC(FN)-GI and FC(FN)-G9 strains (Table 1) (Fig 3D and Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The engineered yeast strains chromosomally harboring Gcyto-ZWT and Gcyto-ZK35A genes showed apparent fluorescence in the GFP transcription assays (Fig 3E and Fig S2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in the mating selection, the same strains grew well on the selective medium (Fig 3F and Fig S2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the Gpa1p-derived N-terminal lipidation motif, the C-terminally attached Ste18p lipidation motif was likely slightly favorable for PPI detection due to a reduction in accessibility between the membrane-associated Fc fragment and the Gcyto-fused Z domain (Fig 3DF and Fig S2DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were clearly different from those following expression of Gcyto-fused candidate Y1 using autonomous replicating plasmids (Fig 3AC and Fig S2AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Competitive_selection_of_affinity-enhanced_protein_variants_interacting_with_membrane_protein_targets_using_a_previous_protocol  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously, we established the competitor-introduced G recruitment system for selective screening of protein variants that exceed a specified affinity threshold41 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the conventional G recruitment system, additional expression of a cytosolic parental (known) protein (Y2) that binds to Gcyto-fused target protein X competes with artificially membrane-associated protein variants as a candidate library (Y1), thereby permitting the selective screening of affinity-enhanced protein variants (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the previous competitor-introduced G recruitment system allows for the use of membrane proteins as target X (Fig 2B and S3A), we consistently used the membrane-associated Fc fragment and the Gcyto-fused Z variants as target X and candidate Y1 proteins, respectively (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4A and S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZI31A (low affinity for Fc; 8.0×103 M1) was utilized as the model of the competitive parental Y2 protein (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4B and S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the ZWT and ZK35A candidate proteins (Y1), with higher affinities, should have outcompeted the interaction between membrane-associated Fc (X) and cytosolic ZI31A (Y2), recovering the signaling in the system (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the previous system, the DNA cassette for ZI31A expression as a competitor Y2 protein in the cytosol was stably integrated into the yeast chromosome of MC-FC, in which the C-terminally membrane-associated Fc fragment (X) (with the Ste18p lipidation motif) was expressed, generating an FC-I strain (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autonomous replication plasmids for expression of the Gcyto-fused Z variants as candidate Y1 (pGK413-G-EZWT, pGK413-G-EZK35A, pGK413-G-EZI31A and pGK413-G-EZ955) (Table 2) were then introduced into the FC-I strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both flow cytometric analysis and mating selection were barely able to detect the interactions between the membrane-associated Fc fragment (target X) and the Gcyto-fused Z variants (candidate Y1) relative to the interactions between the membrane-associated Fc fragment and cytosolic ZI31A in all transformants (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, when using an FN-I strain chromosomally expressing an N-terminally membrane-associated Fc fragment (X) (with a Gpa1p lipidation motif) and competitive ZI31A protein (Y2) (Table 1), the transformants in which the candidate autonomous plasmids were introduced to express the Gcyto-fused Z variants (Y1) provided similar results to the C-terminally membrane-associated Fc fragment (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results showed that the previous system was unable to screen the interactions between membrane-associated target X and candidate Y1-fused Gcyto proteins relative to the interactions between membrane target X and the cytosolic Y2 competitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Competitor-introduced_G_recruitment_system_that_specifically_selects_affinity-enhanced_protein_variants_interacting_with_membrane_protein_targets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to what was described in the previous section, we attempted to change the protocol by introducing the expression cassettes for Gcyto-Y1 candidate genes into the competitor-introduced G recruitment system (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4C and S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As competitive parental Y2 proteins, the genes for expressing the four different Z variants (ZWT, ZK35A, ZI31A and Z955) in the cytosol were integrated into the MC-FC yeast chromosome (also expressing the C-terminally membrane-associated Fc fragment with the Ste18p lipidation motif as target X), generating FC-W, FC-K, FC-I and FC-9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA cassettes for expressing the Gcyto-fused candidate Z variants as model library Y1 proteins were then stably integrated into the chromosome of the four yeast strains, generating 16 engineered yeast strains (FC-GWW through FC-G99; Table 1) (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both flow cytometric analysis and mating selection revealed the interactor combinations between membrane-associated Fc and the Gcyto-fused Z variants serving as candidate Y1 proteins, with higher affinities than when the cytosolic Z variants served as competitor Y2 proteins (e.g., Y1 and Y2: ZWT and ZK35A; ZWT and ZI31A; and ZK35A and ZI31A), although the very weak interactions between Fc and Gcyto-fused ZI31A (Y1 and Y2: ZI31A and Z955) could not be detected (Fig 4D,E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly showed that the strains recovered signal transmission only when interactions between the membrane-associated Fc fragment (target X) and the Gcyto-fused Z variants (candidate Y1) overcame the competitive interactions between Fc (target X) and the cytosolic Z variants (competitor Y2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, when using a strain chromosomally expressing the N-terminally membrane-associated Fc fragment (X) (with the Gpa1p lipidation motif) (FN-GWW through FN-G99; Table 1), similar results were obtained (Fig S4CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, Gcyto-fused Y1 candidate proteins should be stably integrated into the yeast chromosome to specifically select the affinity-enhanced protein variants against membrane-associated protein X in the competitor-introduced G recruitment system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This modification of the method made the competitor-introduced G recruitment system able to screen affinity-enhanced protein variants by using membrane proteins as the target proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Competitive_selection_of_affinity-attenuated_protein_variants_interacting_with_membrane_protein_targets_using_a_previous_protocol  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously, we also established a system that permits the selective screening of affinity-attenuated protein variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the conventional G recruitment system, by setting the cytosolic protein (Y2) as the candidate library and the artificially membrane-associated protein (Y1) as the parental (known) competitor that binds to Gcyto-fused target protein X, the system permits the selective screening of affinity-attenuated protein variants (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the previous competitor-introduced G recruitment system allows for the use of membrane proteins as target X (Fig 2B and S3B), we consistently used the membrane-associated Fc fragment and the cytosolic Z variants as target X and candidate Y2 proteins, respectively (Fig 5A and S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZWT was utilized as the model of the competitive parental Y1 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Gcyto-fused ZWT (Y1) should have outcompeted the interactions between membrane-associated Fc (X) and the ZK35A, ZI31A and Z955 candidate proteins (Y2), which have lower affinities, recovering the signaling in the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the previous system, autonomous replication plasmids for expression of the Z variants in the cytosol as candidate Y2 proteins (pGK-LsZWTc, pGK-LsZK35Ac, pGK-LsZI31Ac and pGK-LsZ955c) (Table 2) were introduced into the FC-GW strain, which chromosomally expresses Fc-Ste18C as X and Gcyto-ZWT as competitor Y1 (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both flow cytometric analysis and mating selection revealed the interactor combinations between membrane-associated Fc and the cytosolic Z variants serving as candidate Y2 proteins, whose affinities were lower than that of Gcyto-fused ZWT as the competitor Y1 protein (Fig 5B,C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, when using the FN-GW strain chromosomally expressing Gpa1N-Fc as X and Gcyto-fused ZWT as competitor Y1 (Table 1), the transformants in which the candidate autonomous plasmids were introduced to express the Z variants in the cytosol (Y2) provided similar results (Fig S5B,C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the affinity-enhanced system, these results showed that the previous competitor-introduced G recruitment system was able to screen affinity-attenuated protein variants using membrane proteins as the target proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Demonstration_of_applicability_of_our_system_using_intracellular_domain_of_EGFR_and_Grb2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate the applicability of our system, we selected the intracellular domain of EGFR (EGFRcyto), which contains a tyrosine kinase domain and tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and the adaptor protein Grb2 protein for the PPI pair49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In normal cells, binding of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the extracellular domain of EGFR leads to dimerization of the receptor and autophosphorylation of the receptor intracellular domain50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grb2 binds to the phosphotyrosines of EGFR and links to the activation of subsequent intracellular signaling cascades52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In yeast, the intracellular domain of EGFR and its mutant derivatives have been often used to test the interaction with Grb2 protein54,55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assay the interaction between EGFR and Grb2 in yeast, we used the intracellular domain of EGFR with L834R mutation (EGFRL834R,cyto; that is constitutively dimerized and activated even in the absence of EGF49,57) as the membrane protein by fusing several types of lipidation motifs at both the N-terminus (Gpa1p motif; Gpa1N) and the C-terminus (Ras1p motif; Ras1C and Ste18p motif; Ste18C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Grb2 adaptor was fused to Gcyto at the N-terminus and the C-terminus to test the accessibility between the membrane-associated EGFRL834R,cyto and the cytosolic Gcyto-fused Grb2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To express the membrane-associated EGFRL834R,cyto protein, the genes encoding the EGFRL834R,cyto attached to the artificial lipidation motifs (Ras1C, Ste18C and Gpa1N) were stably integrated into the ste18 locus of an a-type haploid yeast chromosome, resulting in MC-ErC, MC-EsC and MC-EgN yeast strains (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the candidate proteins, the DNA cassettes for cytosolic expression of the Gcyto-fused Grb2 at the N-terminus and the C-terminus (Gcyto-Grb2 and Grb2-Gcyto) were stably integrated into the MC-ErC, MC-EsC and MC-EgN yeast chromosomes, generating ErC-Ggrb(grbG), EsC-Ggrb(grbG) and EgN-Ggrb(grbG) (Table 1) (Fig S6A,D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of GFP transcription assays and mating selection, the engineered strains co-expressing the EGFRL834R,cyto with C-terminal lipidation motifs (Ras1C and Ste18C) and the C-terminally Gcyto-fused Grb2 (Grb2-Gcyto) specifically showed apparent fluorescence and cell growth on the selective medium (Fig S6AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accessibility between the phosphotyrosines of membrane-associated EGFRL834R,cyto and the SH2 domains of Grb2 or the distance of Gcyto complex from the membrane might have influenced the interactions of these proteins or to the subsequent membrane-anchored effector molecule49,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the MC-ErC strain introducing the Grb2-Gcyto-expressing autonomous replicating plasmid (pGK413-Grb2-G) (Table 2), the ErC-grbG strain that chromosomally expressed Grb2-Gcyto was determinably more suitable for recovering the signaling (Fig 6AE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further test whether the competitor-introduced G recruitment system that has designed to select the affinity-enhanced protein variants interacting with membrane target proteins is applicable to the intracellular domain of EGFR, we consistently used the membrane-associated EGFRL834R,cyto and the Gcyto-fused Grb2 as membrane target X and candidate Y1 proteins, respectively (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several Grb2 variants (Grb2, Grb2E89K and Grb2R86G) with different affinities for the phosphotyrosines of EGFR were utilized for the competitive parental Y2 proteins (Ka; Grb2Grb2E89KGrb2R86G)58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to what was described in the previous section, we tested the new protocol by chromosomally integrating the expression cassettes for Y1-Gcyto candidate genes (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As competitive parental Y2 proteins, the genes for expressing the three different Grb2 variants (Grb2, Grb2E89K and Grb2R86G) in the cytosol were integrated into the ErC-grbG yeast chromosome (also co-expressing the membrane-associated EGFRL834R,cyto with the Ras1p lipidation motif as target X and the Grb2-Gcyto fusion protein as candidate Y1-Gcyto), generating ErC-grbG-grb, ErC-grbG-E89K and ErC-grbG-R86G (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ErC-grbG-LEU yeast strain never expressing any competitor proteins was also generated as positive control (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both flow cytometric analysis and mating selection displayed the consistent results with the Z variants as expected (Fig 6G,H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When using the strains respectively expressing Grb2E89K and Grb2R86G as the competitive parental Y2 proteins (ErC-grbG-E89K and ErC-grbG-R86G), the Gcyto-fused Grb2 expressed as candidate Y1 (Grb2-Gcyto) predictably recovered the signaling in accordance with the order of difference in the affinity strengths between the competitive proteins and the candidate proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the strain co-expressing the same Grb2 protein as the candidate Y1 and the parental Y2 proteins (ErC-grbG-grb) barely showed GFP fluorescence and cell growth on the selective medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we demonstrated that our systems were applicable to the membrane protein, which linked to the cellular states involved in various diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we found that the previously established G recruitment systems41,42 were basically unable to utilize membrane proteins as target protein X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new systems described here successfully enable the use of membrane proteins as target X, both in the conventional (for screening of PPI candidate Y1 proteins) and competitor-introduced (for screening of affinity-enhanced candidate Y1 protein variants) G recruitment systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the new systems, only the protocol for expression of Gcyto-fused candidate Y1 proteins was changed: instead of autonomous replicating plasmids, chromosomal integration was employed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These new systems are therefore very simple but highly useful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the intracellular domain of EGFR and Grb2 interaction showed that our G recruitment systems could be exploited as a convenient heterologous system to discern the strong binders to the phosphotyrosines in the intracellular domain of EGFR, and therefore would provide the basis for studying other receptor tyrosine kinases as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this manner, the screening of binding partners and affinity-enhanced variants targeted to the inner domains of these membrane proteins has great potential for applications in the treatment of human diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously, we demonstrated that G recruitment systems enabled extremely reliable screening that could completely exclude false-positive candidates41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, membrane yeast two-hybrid systems30,31,33,34 and protein fragment complementation assays23,38 sometimes exhibit background readouts23,59 due to the use of directly fused artificial transcription factors and automatic self-associations of the split proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These background readouts are a critical problem, even when they are negligible, especially in the case of growth screening using a large-scale library23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exclusive selection in G recruitment systems is made possible by using the signal transduction machinery, which requires the localization of G/G in GFP transcription assays and mating selection (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3, 4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This extremely disciplined selection machinery makes G recruitment systems worth using.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the G recruitment system that has designed for membrane proteins as the target, ZI31A with extremely low affinity could not be detected in both cases of the flow cytometric analysis and the mating selection (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the very low affinity between ZI31A and the Fc region (8.0×103 M1), the migration of Gcyto to the membrane was likely insufficient for the recovering of the signal transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This affinity (8.0×103 M1) seems to be less than a lower limit of our present system, although it is unlikely that a protein mutant exhibiting such extremely low affinity would be required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the perspective of screening for a target membrane protein X, the new methods that chromosomally integrate the DNA cassettes expressing Gcyto-fused candidate Y1 proteins might have a handicap in constructing a library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the transformation efficiencies of homologous integrations into the yeast chromosome are commonly 101102 fold lower than those of autonomous replicating plasmids (approximately 105106cfu/g)60,61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, constructing a large-scale library might require a little ingenuity to increase the transformation efficiencies, such as via the use of large amounts of DNA, the electroporation method61,63, the spheroplasting method64, and use of I-SceI meganuclease65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even allowing for this additional effort, however, the conventional G recruitment system is a powerful tool because of its extremely reliable selection of binding partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the competitor-introduced G recruitment system, which allows for the specific screening of affinity-enhanced protein variants (specifically excluding protein variants showing equal or lower affinities41), is valuable as a unique and irreplaceable growth selection technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A similar approach for screening for affinity-attenuated protein variants among membrane proteins serving as target X made it possible to apply the previous method using autonomous replicating plasmids to express the candidate Y2 in the cytosol (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that the unstable expression of Y1-fused Gcyto using autonomous replicating plasmids rendered the G recruitment system useless.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because it has been reported that plasmid retentions become unstable during signal-promoted states66, Y1-fused Gcyto might be more affected by this unstable plasmid retention than cytosolic Y2 is.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any event, the chromosomal expression of Y1-fused Gcyto is favorable in our G recruitment systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, new G recruitment systems make it possible for membrane proteins to be target protein X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These systems permit reliable and specific screens for binding partners and affinity-enhanced protein variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We envision that our selection method will provide a powerful, broadly applicable tool for studying biological processes, creating new opportunities to develop new drugs targeting a wide range of membrane-associated proteins and inner domains of transmembrane proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
