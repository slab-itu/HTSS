CRISPR/Cas9-generated p47phox-deficient cell line for Chronic Granulomatous Disease gene therapy vector development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Development of gene therapy vectors requires cellular models reflecting the genetic background of a disease thus allowing for robust preclinical vector testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For human p47phox-deficient chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) vector testing we generated a cellular model using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 to introduce a GT-dinucleotide deletion (GT) mutation in p47phox encoding NCF1 gene in the human acute myeloid leukemia PLB-985 cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CGD is a group of hereditary immunodeficiencies characterized by impaired respiratory burst activity in phagocytes due to a defective phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Western countries autosomal-recessive p47phox-subunit deficiency represents the second largest CGD patient cohort with unique genetics, as the vast majority of p47phox CGD patients carries GT deletion in exon two of the NCF1 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The established PLB-985 NCF1 GT cell line reflects the most frequent form of p47phox-deficient CGD genetically and functionally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be differentiated to granulocytes efficiently, what creates an attractive alternative to currently used iPSC models for rapid testing of novel gene therapy approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) comprises a group of monogenetic immunodeficiencies characterized by impaired respiratory burst activity and microbicidal activity of phagocytes leading to recurrent life-threatening infections1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CGD can be cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, autologous retroviral gene therapy has been used in selected patients with X-linked CGD (X-CGD)3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mutations in gp91phox, p47phox, p67phox, p40phox or p22phox subunits of the phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase may cause CGD8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Western countries gp91phox-deficiency is the most frequent from (65%)9, followed by p47phox-deficiency (25%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations within gp91phox are scattered throughout the whole cytochrome b-245 beta chain (CYBB) gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, p47phox-deficiency is almost exclusively caused by a single GT-dinucleotide deletion (GT) in exon 2 of neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (NCF1) gene causing frameshift and premature translation stop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GT deletion is shared with two pseudogenes, NCF1B and NCF1C, all located on the same chromosome sharing extraordinary homology (99.5%) (Fig 1A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, homologous recombination causes the predominance of the GT mutation in p47phox-deficient CGD patients10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Currently, development of gene therapy vectors for p47phox-deficient CGD is hampered by the absence of human cell lines for rapid gene therapy vector testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p47phox/ mouse models exist, but cannot replace vector testing on human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we established human p47phox-deficient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines harboring the GT within the NCF1 gene11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only these iPSC-based cell lines reflect the genetic background of the most frequent mutation in CGD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As maintenance and differentiation of iPSC lines is laborious and in many aspects impractical, we established a novel model for GT p47phox-deficient CGD based on a human acute myeloid leukemia PLB-985 cell line12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We nucleofected PLB-985 wild type (WT) cells with pPX458-NCF1 plasmid encoding Cas9, single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting NCF1, and GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To introduce the GT in NCF1 a 100-nucleotide long single stranded oligonucleotide (ssODN) template, carrying the GT, was co-transfected (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nucleofected GFP expressing cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and expanded to monoclonal cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out of 609 sorted cells 22 clones could be expanded (3.6% survival rate, Supplementary Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These clones were analyzed by PCR co-amplification of NCF1, NCF1B and NCF1C alleles (Fwd1, Rev1 primers, Fig 1B), followed by BsrG1 digestion13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BsrG1 cleavage of NCF1 gene gives 135bp and 63bp products, while NCF1B, NCF1C, or mutated NCF1 lack the BsrG1 restriction site (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The BsrG1 analysis of one nucleofected PLB-985 clone displayed the same band pattern as of a GT p47phox-deficient CGD patient (Fig 1D and Supplementary Fig S1), suggesting a Cas9-mediated disruption of the BsrG1 site in both NCF1 alleles (homozygous mutation efficiency 4.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BsrG1 digestion analysis of the remaining clones suggested heterozygosity in these clones (Supplementary Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm the presence of the GT in mutated NCF1, genomic DNA of WT and pPX458-NCF1-treated PLB-985 cells were used for PCR co-amplification of the NCF1, NCF1B, and NCF1C (Fwd1, Rev2 primers, Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The barcoded PCR products were analyzed by single molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT-seq) for the presence of GT-dinucleotide, GT, as well as for the presence of one copy of 20-nucleotide (20-nt) intronic repeat (1×20nt) derived from NCF1 or two repeats (2×20nt) derived from NCF1B or NCF1C (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMRT-seq analysis showed that PLB-985 WT and PLB-985 NCF1 GT cell lines displayed almost identical percentage (61%) of reads with one or two copies of the 20-nucleotide repeat (Fig 1E), indicating that all three NCF1 loci were co-amplified with comparable efficiencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, all SMRT-seq reads from PLB-985 NCF1 GT displayed the GT, while in PLB-985 WT 37.4% harbored the GT-dinucleotide sequence, as expected from the two NCF1 alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Potential off-target sites of utilized sgRNA were predicted (Supplementary Table S2) and DNA sequences of 14 sites with highest scores were analyzed for presence of insertions or deletions (indels) by Surveyor assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In none of the potential off-target sites indels were observed (Supplemetary Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Flow cytometry analysis of granulocytically differentiated PLB-985 WT and PLB-985 X-CGD cells14 revealed 86.1% and 89.4% of p47phox protein expressing cells (Fig 2A) (gating, Supplementary Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No p47phox expression was observed in differentiated PLB-985 NCF1 GT cells, which were CD14-negative, CD15-positive and partially gp91phox-positive (Supplementary Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that differentiated PLB-985 NCF1 GT cells mirror the absent respiratory burst observed in primary neutrophils of GT p47phox-deficient CGD patients, we tested this cell line for NADPH oxidase-mediated superoxide production with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In differentiated PLB-985 WT cells, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-stimulation induced superoxide production in 47.8±4.2% of cells, as was visualized by formazan precipitates (Fig 2B and Supplementary Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PMA-stimulation of differentiated PLB-985 X-CGD and PLB-985 NCF1 GT cells resulted only in background signal of 1.7±1.0% and 0.9±0.5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the established p47phox-deficient PLB-985 NCF1 GT cell line does not respond to PMA-stimulation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of ROS production in PLB-985 X-CGD and PLB-985 NCF1 GT cells was confirmed by chemiluminescence assay (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The iPSC model of GT p47phox-deficient CGD11 can be differentiated to monocytes, macrophages11 and granulocytes15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the use of iPSCs is laborious, and time-consuming, as phagocytic differentiation requires long culture periods of 3543 days15,17 requiring large amounts of cytokines and continuous surveillance of the culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast full granulocytic differentiation of PLB-985 NCF1 GT cell line takes 7 days, requires only fetal calf serum (FCS) restriction (5%) and supplementation with 0.5% N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the differentiation of neutrophils can be easily assessed by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The function of the NADPH oxidase complex within PLB-985 NCF1 GT cells was reconstituted by transduction with two -retroviral vectors encoding p47phox protein (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transgene expression was driven either by the ubiquitously active spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) promoter or by the myelospecific microRNA 223 (mir223) promoter18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression cassette was composed of truncated Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (LNGFR) and p47phox linked by the 2A self-cleaving peptide19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transduction efficiency reached 8.9% and 11.6% for mir223, and SFFV-driven -retroviral vectors (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Functional reconstruction of the NADPH oxidase complex activity in transduced and differentiated PLB-985 NCF1 GT cells was assessed by NBT assay (Fig 2F) and chemiluminescence assay (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Percentage of NBT-positive cells reached 13.4±2.1% with the mir223, and 11.8±1.8% with the SFFV-driven LNGFR-2A-p47phox expression constructs (Fig 2F and Supplementary Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemiluminescence assay of transduced and differentiated PLB-985 NCF1 GT cells confirmed reconstitution of ROS production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly indicate that the defect of the NADPH oxidase complex caused by the GT mutation within NCF1 in the PLB-985 NCF1 GT cell line can be corrected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, the CRISPR/Cas9-generated PLB-985 NCF1 GT cell line fully recapitulates the genetic background and functional NADPH oxidase defect found in majority of p47phox-deficient CGD patients, can be corrected genetically and differentiated into functional neutrophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PLB-985 NCF1 GT cell line therefore represents a promising cost-effective tool for rapid gene therapy vector testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Processing of human samples is covered by ethical vote KEK ZH nr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2015/0135.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic DNA was isolated using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parallel PCR co-amplification of the NCF1, NCF1B, and NCF1C was performed using published primers23 (Fwd1 and Rev1, Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For PCR reaction using Fwd1/Rev2 primers Fwd1 primer was barcoded for each template producing products of 417bp from NCF1 and of 435bp from NCF1B and NCF1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR products were pooled for SMRT sequencing and analyzed according to barcode identities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PCR mixture included HF 10× buffer, 200M of each dNTP, 240nM of each primer, 0.04U/L of Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, and 2.5ng/L of genomic DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial denaturation at 95°C for 3minutes was followed by 36 cycles of denaturation (95°C, 30seconds), annealing (70°C, 30seconds), elongation (72°C, 8seconds), and a final elongation step (72°C, 1minute).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR products were digested with BsrG1 and visualized on a 3% (w/vol) agarose gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
