The mevalonate pathway regulates primitive streak formation via protein farnesylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The primitive streak in peri-implantation embryos forms the mesoderm and endoderm and controls cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metabolic cues regulating primitive streak formation remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we utilised a mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation system and a library of well-characterised drugs to identify these metabolic factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that statins, which inhibit the mevalonate metabolic pathway, suppressed primitive streak formation in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using metabolomics and pharmacologic approaches we identified the downstream signalling pathway of mevalonate and revealed that primitive streak formation requires protein farnesylation but not cholesterol synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A tagging-via-substrate approach revealed that nuclear lamin B1 and small G proteins were farnesylated in embryoid bodies and important for primitive streak gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, protein farnesylation driven by the mevalonate pathway is a metabolic cue essential for primitive streak formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In animals, the process of gastrulation involves complex movements of cells to generate the three germ layers of the early embryo that give rise to all the organs and tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In amniotes such as mice and primates, gastrulation involves formation of a groove of cells known as the primitive streak, which gives rise to the endoderm and mesoderm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation system is a powerful in vitro tool for studying these fundamental developmental processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When ES cells are cultured in suspension, they form multicellular aggregates called embryoid bodies (EBs) in a process that closely mimics early embryogenesis in vivo1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These EBs efficiently differentiate into mesodermal cardiomyocytes, but upon the addition of factors affecting primitive streak formation, the fate of the ES cells changes to ectodermal neurons2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this mouse EB differentiation system is a powerful tool for identifying the mechanisms of primitive streak formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we screened a library of 1,600 well-characterised drugs to evaluate their effect on cell fate and potentially identify new mechanisms involved in early embryogenesis (Supplementary Figure 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 15 drugs, including atorvastatin (ATV) and lovastatin, that caused a visible change in ES cell fate from cardiomyocytes to neurons, suggesting a role in primitive streak formation (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statins are used extensively in the clinic as cholesterol-lowering drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They work by inhibiting the mevalonate (or HMG-CoA reductase [HMGCR]) pathway, which amongst other things, leads to the biosynthesis of steroids such as cholesterol5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathway has not previously been linked with primitive streak formation, so we chose to study it in more detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse the effects of statins on EB differentiation, we performed immunostaining and quantitative real-time PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATV treatment during culture days 16 almost completely inhibited EB differentiation into contractile cardiomyocytes and induced the formation of -tubulin III-positive neurites by day 12 (Fig 1a and b, Supplementary Figure 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time PCR confirmed that the cardiomyocyte marker Mhy7 was induced during days 812 in control EBs but not in ATV-treated EBs (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, ATV treatment induced the expression of the neuronal markers Map2, Sox1 and Otx2 (Fig 1b and Supplementary Figure 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we determined the timepoint(s) at which ATV treatment inhibited cardiomyocyte differentiation by determining the relative decrease in the number of beating foci in an EB culture, which reflects cardiomyocyte differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATV treatment during days 12 or 56 did not decrease the beating ratio, but treatment between days 34 markedly reduced the number of beating foci (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blotting (WB) and real-time PCR confirmed that ATV treatment on days 34 repressed the expression of the cardiomyocyte markers sarcomeric -actinin and Mhy7 and also induced the expression of the neuronal markers -tubulin III, synaptophysin, neurofilament 68 (NF68) and Map2 (Fig 1d, Supplementary Figure 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATV treatment during days 12 increased the levels of sarcomeric -actinin, which might be due to the enhanced level of HMGCR (Supplementary Figure 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, ATV blocks mevalonic acid (MVA) production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the effects of ATV were prevented by co-treatment with MVA (Fig 1e, Supplementary Figure 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the effects of ATV on EB differentiation were caused by inhibition of the HMGCR pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vivo primitive streak formation starts at embryonic day (E) 6 in the mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the effect of statin on mouse embryos in the primitive streak stage in vivo, ATV was injected into the uteri of E5.5 pregnant mice, and the survival ratio of embryos was calculated at E10.5 (Fig 1f and g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATV-treated embryos had a lower survival ratio compared with DMSO-treated controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, MVA addition partially ameliorated ATVs effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether the effects of statin were conserved in other species, we treated one-cell stage zebrafish embryos with ATV and evaluated cardiomyogenesis and neurogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ hybridisation of whole ATV-treated zebrafish embryos revealed that ATV disrupted heart morphogenesis in a dose-dependent manner, causing either cardia bifida or the complete absence of a heart (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time PCR confirmed that ATV suppressed the cardiomyocyte marker cMhc2 in zebrafish embryos, whereas the neuroectodermal marker nestin was markedly increased (Fig 1i and j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that the role of the mevalonate pathway in early embryogenesis is conserved between mouse and zebrafish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain initial insight into the mechanism by which statins affect early embryogenesis, we performed microarray analysis of EBs during days 34, which is the most sensitive two day period for ATV when compared to days 12 and days 56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATV reduced the expression of 417 genes by 50% in EBs on days 3 and 4 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ontology analysis revealed that many of these genes are involved in early embryogenesis, particularly gastrulation (GO: 0007369, P=5.26Ã—1031) (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a role specifically in primitive streak formation, ATV markedly suppressed primitive streak and mesodermal markers (Lhx1, Wnt3, Wnt8, GSC, Fgf10 and Fgf8) as well as endodermal markers (Sox17 and Gata6) on day 4, which was reversed by MVA addition (Supplementary Figure 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cultured mouse EBs, a primitive streak-like domain initiates a gastrulation process driven by many genes (Supplementary Figure 2b)1,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used real-time PCR and in situ hybridisation to examine the expression of the primitive streak marker Brachyury T (T) and the early ectodermal marker Sox2 in mouse EBs treated with ATV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, T was expressed at high levels in a localised region in control EBs, however levels were significantly reduced by ATV treatment (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was partially rescued by MVA (Fig 2c and Supplementary Figure 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Sox2 levels increased in ATV-treated EBs compared with controls, and this was again reversed by MVA addition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by ATV blocks primitive streak formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, ATV-treated epiblast cells differentiate into ectoderm that gives rise to neurons (Supplementary Figure 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mevalonate pathway is important for the biosynthesis of terpenes and steroids such as cholesterol5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we performed a metabolomic analysis to determine the effect of ATV on intracellular metabolite composition during primitive streak formation in EBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control and ATV-treated EBs were collected on days 4 and 5, and 147 metabolites were identified followed by unsupervised clustering and heat map visualisation (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATV-treated EBs had a strikingly different metabolomic profile compared to control EBs; ATV specifically downregulated 46 metabolites and upregulated 37 metabolites on days 4 and 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed principal component analysis to graphically visualise the relationship between ATV-treated and vehicle-treated EB populations and days of differentiation (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first principal component distinguished ATV-treated EBs from controls, while the second principal component characterised the differences in differentiation between days 4 and 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sphingomyelins (d18:1/16:0), sphingosine and sphingomyelins (d18:1/18:0) were the main contributors to the first principal component (Fig 3c, Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the free fatty acids (FAs) palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0) and oleic acid (18:1) were increased following ATV treatment, whereas intermediates of FA biosynthesis from acetyl-CoA, namely palmitoylcarnitine (16:0), acylcarnitine (18:0) and acylcarnitine (18:1) were decreased (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statins also enhanced the expression of the FA synthase (FAS) gene (Supplementary Table 4), together suggesting that statins enhance lipogenesis but suppress the catabolic -oxidation of FAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that FAS-dependent de novo synthesis of FA is enhanced in active neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) and is crucial for NSPC proliferation8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations support the idea that a statin-dependent increase in free FA and FAS activity would promote neurogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, statins markedly decreased amino acids and dipeptides such as threonine, arginine and Gly-Asp (Supplementary Table 3), which might contribute to the inhibition of the primitive streak formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, given the major role of statins in inhibiting cholesterol production, the intracellular cholesterol level in ATV-treated EBs was actually higher than in control EBs (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by a balance of de novo synthesis and incorporation10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the observed elevation in intracellular cholesterol might be due to enhanced expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (Supplementary Table 4), which takes up extracellular cholesterol and is induced by statins11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our results indicate that the inhibition of statin-mediated primitive streak formation is not caused by a decrease in intracellular cholesterol but is associated with other metabolic anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the signalling pathways underlying statin-induced inhibition of primitive streak formation, we analysed the role of cholesterol, geranylgeranyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate, which are all downstream of the mevalonate pathway (Supplementary Figure 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to ATV treatment, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI-277) almost completely abolished cardiomyogenesis in EBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a squalene synthetase inhibitor (zaragozic acid), which blocks the biosynthesis of cholesterol, and a geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor (GGTI-2133) did not suppress cardiomyogenesis (Fig 4a, Supplementary Figure 3b and c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the effect of ATV on primitive streak formation, real-time PCR confirmed that expression of the primitive streak genes T and Lhx1 were also markedly suppressed by FTI-277 (Fig 4b, Supplementary Figure 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, FTI-277 inhibited primitive streak formation and induced Sox2 expression (ectodermal differentiation) in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Farnesyltransferase is an enzyme transferring farnesyl diphosphate to the cysteines at the C-terminus of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, farnesol rescued T expression in ATV-treated EBs, confirming the involvement of farnesyl diphosphate in primitive streak formation (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that the inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate inhibits primitive streak formation, similar to statin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Farnesylation is a protein modification in which a farnesyl group is covalently attached to cysteine residues within carboxyl-terminal CaaX motifs12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the farnesylated proteins involved in EB primitive streak formation, we used a comprehensive tagging-via-substrate (TAS) approach13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Supplementary Figure 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several ~20kDa farnesylated proteins were present in both the control ES cells and EBs (black arrowheads in Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These spots corresponded to several small G proteins, including the well-known farnesyl substrates H-, N- and K-Ras and Cdc42, all of which have crucial roles in early embryogenesis15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we focused on the 42kDa spot appearing specifically in EBs (white arrowhead in Fig 4d and Supplementary Figure 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LC-MS/MS analysis of the 42kDa farnesylated protein spot identified it as lamin B1 (Supplementary Figure 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the subcellular localisation of lamin B1 in mouse ES cells, we introduced Myc-tagged wild type (WT) lamin B1 or a mutant lamin B1C-S in which the cysteine residue of CaaX is changed to serine so it can no longer be farnesylated18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT farnesylated lamin B1 localised to the nuclear membrane, whereas non-farnesylated mutant lamin B1 accumulated in the nucleoplasm (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data confirmed that lamin B1 is tethered to the nuclear membrane by C-terminal farnesylation as previously shown19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the biological function of lamin B1 in primitive streak formation, we used haploid genetics to generate lamin B1-deficient (KO) and lamin B1-revertant (REV) clones (Supplementary Figure 5a and b)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lamin B1 REV ES cells are positive isogenic controls directly derived from the lamin B1 KO cell line by inducing Cre expression and thereby reactivating expression of lamin B1, which excludes any effect of genetic background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBs were prepared from the WT, KO and REV ES cell lines (Supplementary Figure 5c and d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used real-time PCR to examine marker genes of primitive streak formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actin (housekeeping gene) expression did not differ among WT, KO and REV EBs (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, expression of the primitive streak marker T and the mesodermal marker Lhx1 was markedly suppressed in KO EBs compared with WT and REV EBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that Lamin B1 has a crucial role in the induction of primitive streak genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has classified ATV to pregnancy category X, meaning that the risks involved in use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our data show that the mevalonate (HMGCR) pathway is essential for the formation of the primitive streak in cultured EBs and in mice (Fig 5, Supplementary Figure 3), and suggest an embryotoxic effect of statin on mammalian embryos, which should help better inform these guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During mouse embryogenesis, primitive streak formation occurs during E67.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our in vitro and in vivo results, Hmgcr KO mice die by E8.521 and FTase KO mice succumb by E7.522 (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified farnesyl transferase downstream of the mevalonate pathway, which mediates the farnesylation of various proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied TAS technology to our ES cell differentiation system and showed that various farnesylated proteins were expressed in normal ES cells and EBs (Fig 4d, Supplementary Figure 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these, we identified ~20kDa farnesyl spots that corresponded to several small G proteins, including Cdc42 and Ras proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of one of these small G proteins is typically embryonic lethal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cdc42 KO mice die at ~E7.516, and K-Ras KO mice die between E12.5 and birth15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H-Ras/K-Ras double KO mice survive until E11.5, and H-Ras/K-Ras/N-Ras triple KO mice died much earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest a key role for farnesylation in multiple stages of embryogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our genetic and biochemical approaches coupled with our in vitro ES cell system allowed us to discover a novel function for Lamin B1 in primitive streak formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Lamin B1 REV ES cells were directly derived from the Lamin B1 KO cell line (Supplementary Figure 5), possibly explaining how we were able to detect a subtle phenotype missed in previous studies23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, it was revealed that chromatin-Lamin B1 interactions are tightly linked to gene repression during ES cell lineage commitment26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study indicates that the genome-nuclear lamina interactions are also involved in the primitive streak formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Total RNA was extracted from mouse ES cells using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Centre) and further purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as described previously32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quality of RNA was initially assessed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and later by absorption spectrophotometry [Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDNAs were synthesised using the Low Input Quick Amp labelling kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cy3-labelled cRNA was synthesised by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following fragmentation, cRNA (0.6g) was hybridised for 17h at 65Â°C to the SurePrint G3 mouse GE 8Ã—60K microarray using a Gene Expression hybridisation kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GeneChips were washed using the Gene Expression wash buffers and scanned using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner (G2565CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microarray data analysis was conducted using KeyMolnet software (Institute of Medicinal Molecular Design Inc., Tokyo, Japan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metabolomic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metabolomic analyses were performed as described previously5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CE-TOFMS analysis, EBs (100) were washed once with 10ml 5% mannitol solution and then with 2ml of the same solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBs were treated with 800l methanol for at least 30s to inactivate enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell extracts were incubated with 550l Milli-Q water containing internal standards (Solution ID: H3304-1002, Human Metabolome Technologies, Inc., Tsuruoka, Japan) for at least 30s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extracts were centrifuged at 2,300Ã—g at 4Â°C for 5min, and 800l of the upper aqueous layer was recovered and filtered through a Millipore 5-kDa cutoff filter by centrifugation at 9,100Ã—g at 4Â°C for 4h to remove proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For LC-TOF-MS analysis, EBs were washed twice with 10ml 5% mannitol solution and treated with 1ml ethanol containing internal standards to inactivate enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_farnesylated_proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The TAS technique was performed as previously described13 with slight modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ES cells (2Ã—106) and EBs (200) were treated with 25M farnesyl azide (Molecular Probes and Thermo Scientific) plus 10M ATV for 24h to metabolically label farnesylated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ES cells and EBs were homogenised, and extracts containing farnesyl azide-modified proteins were incubated with 250M biotin-phosphine (Molecular Probes and Thermo Scientific) at room temperature for 16h to selectively ligate azide and phosphine groups via the Staudinger-Bertozzi reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unreacted probes were removed by chloroform-methanol precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For modified TAS technology, 3xFLAG-phosphine prepared by Operon, Inc. was used instead of biotin-phosphine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell lysates (150g) were subjected to 2D-PAGE using an immobilised pH gradient for first-dimension isoelectric focusing (IEF) (ZOOM IPGRunner System; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions, with slight modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biotinylated proteins and 3xFLAG-modified proteins were detected using streptavidin-HRP and anti-FLAG Ab, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using LC-FT-MS/MS (Thermo Scientific, LTQ Orbitrap Velos).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_Lamin_B1-deficient_mouse_ES_cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lamin B1-targeted ES cell clones were generated using haploid genetics as described previously20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutagenesis of haploid cells to disrupt Lamin B1 function was performed with a polyA-trap cloned into a Tol2 transposon vector modified from Mayasari NI et al.35 (Elling, Wimmer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  unpublished).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To retrieve Lamin B1 gene function in the same clone, the stably integrated polyA trap was flipped by transient expression of Cre-recombinase (described in Mayasari et al.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ES clones (mCherry-positive and GFP-negative) were sorted by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This step was performed to minimize the probability of clonal effects (Supplementary Figure 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
