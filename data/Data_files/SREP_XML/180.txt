Interplay of histidine residues of the Alzheimers disease A peptide governs its Zn-induced oligomerization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conformational changes of A peptide result in its transformation from native monomeric state to the toxic soluble dimers, oligomers and insoluble aggregates that are hallmarks of Alzheimers disease (AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interactions of zinc ions with A are mediated by the N-terminal A116 domain and appear to play a key role in AD progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a range of results indicating that these interactions trigger the A plaque formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have determined structure and functional characteristics of the metal binding domains derived from several A variants and found that their zinc-induced oligomerization is governed by conformational changes in the minimal zinc binding site 6HDSGYEVHH14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residue H6 and segment 11EVHH14, which are part of this site are crucial for formation of the two zinc-mediated interaction interfaces in A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structural determinants can be considered as promising targets for rational design of the AD-modifying drugs aimed at blocking pathological A aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to the amyloid hypothesis, which has been the predominant framework for Alzheimer disease (AD) studies, A aggregation has a unique and critical role as an initiator of AD pathology1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What triggers A aggregation still remains unclear, however, some genetically and/or post-translationally modified A species accumulated in the amyloid plaques appear to act as the pathogenic aggregation seeds3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown in animal models of AD that zinc ions might play a crucial role in the A plaque formation in vivo4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, at concentration as high as that detected in the synapse, zinc ions specifically bind A and are able to facilitate A aggregation8, which could explain abnormally high levels of zinc ions within amyloid plaques of AD patients9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is assumed that zinc ions promote A aggregation via population shift of polymorphic states11 with a mechanism similar to that observed for larger zinc-binding proteins12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When zinc-induced A amyloidogenesis is observed in vitro, conformational changes in A are also identified13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, precise structural details of these changes were elusive since three-dimensional structures of A oligomers complexed with zinc ions were unavailable14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interaction of Zn2+ with monomeric A species is mediated by the metal binding domain which comprises the N-terminal region 116 of A15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A116 exists in health and disease as a separate entity18, suggesting its possible role as the structural and functional unit of the full-length A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the interaction of N-terminal region 116 with the -strand hydrophobic region 17- 42 is negligible in the model amyloid aggregates19,20, and also synthetic peptides A116 exhaustively simulate the metal binding properties of A15,16,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous NMR studies of the N-terminus of A showed that the first 9 residues are poorly structured, whereas residues beyond 10 form a distinct local conformation17,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structure of the tethered N-terminus of the Alzheimers disease amyloid- peptide obtained using X-ray crystallography31 showed that A region 1016 is relatively rigid and adopts a mixture of the local polyproline II-helix (PPII) and turn type conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fragment A116 includes several charged residues with their location typical of ionic self-complementary peptides32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These residues participate in the formation of electrostatic contacts, which can stabilize both intra and intermolecular interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region 1016 of A appeared to be an effective metal ion trapping unit33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fragment 614 of A has been determined as the minimal Zn2+ binding site wherein the ion is coordinated by H6, E11, H13, and H1434.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under physiological conditions in the presence of Zn2+ the metal binding domains of several natural A variants form homo- and hetero-dimeric complexes35,36,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues 1114 of the two interacting subunits compose the dimer interface wherein two pairs of E11 and H14 residues coordinate a zinc ion36,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Along with the intact A isoforms which are heterogenous at their N-termini and/or C-termini, the amyloid plaques involve a variety of chemically modified A variants39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A species extracted from the plaques can initiate pathological aggregation of endogenous A upon intracerebral injections into animal models of AD3,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several post-translational modifications have been discovered to increase the aggregation rate of A42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some chemical modifications and amino acid changes within the metal binding domain of A (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  isomerization of D7, phosphorylation of S8, and the H6R English familial mutation associated with early onset AD) facilitate zinc-dependent dimerization and/or oligomerization of the domain36,38,43, thus suggesting their potential role in initiating the pathological aggregation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, peripheral injections of the synthetic A species bearing isomerized D7 (isoD7-A) was shown to trigger cerebral amyloidosis in vivo44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known about the A metal binding sites in the aggregated state (oligomers or fibrils), but in general, it seems that the binding sites are similar to those in the monomeric peptide11,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the current study, we have used high resolution NMR spectroscopy to reveal the structural determinants of zinc-induced A oligomerization, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the structure elements that are responsible for the ability of A to form zinc-bound intermolecular complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synthetic peptides corresponding to the metal binding domains of the intact A (A116), of the English H6R A mutant (H6R-A116), A containing isomerized D7 (isoD7-A116) and several truncated and mutant forms of these peptides have been used as experimental models (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solution structure of the zinc-bridged H6R-A116 dimer has been determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure provides direct information on the primary zinc-mediated A dimer interface, formed by the residues 11EVHH14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of residues H6 and H13 in the emergence of the second Zn2+-dependent interface within the interacting metal binding domains A116 and isoD7-A116 during their zinc-induced oligomerization has been also revealed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the data indicate that interplay of histidine residues in the minimal zinc-binding site 614 of A upon its interactions with zinc ions underlies critical conformational changes of A, which in turn lead to A dimerization, oligomerization and aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results provide structural basis for rational design of the AD-modifying drugs aimed at blocking pathological A aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NMR_signal_assignments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Earlier we reported chemical shift assignments of 11617 and H6R-11636.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1H, 13C and 15N chemical shifts of the peptides isoD7-116, isoD7-110, isoD7-H13R-116, 616 and their complexes with Zn2+ ions have been assigned by analysis of the set of 2D homonuclear (NOESY, ROESY, TOCSY, DQF-COSY) and heteronuclear (13C-1H HSQC and 15N-1H HSQC) NMR experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heteronuclear spectra (Figs S1S4) have been acquired at the natural abundance of 13C and 15N isotopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of isoD7-116, isoD7-H13R-116 and 616 15N resonance assignments have been obtained for the free peptides only, as substantial zinc-induced signal broadening does not allow collection of heteronuclear correlation spectra at the natural abundance of 15N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resonance assignments for nearly all 1H and 13C nuclei have been determined for all studied peptides and their zinc complexes (Tables S1S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structure_of_the_metal_binding_domains_116__H6R-116_and_isoD7-116_in_free_state_in_solution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structures of the peptides 116, H6R-116 and isoD7-116 in free state in solution is virtually identical, as shown by the NMR spectra of the peptides measured in the absence of zinc ions (Fig 2, Figs S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the fact that the peptides are relatively flexible, as evidenced by their narrow lines in NMR spectra, several distinct cross peaks detected in NOESY spectra indicate that the dominant backbone conformation in the region of residues 1015 is close to the left-handed polyproline-II helix, observed in the crystal structure of 11631.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOEs between amide protons of neighboring residues HNi-HNi1 and between amide protons and H (HNi-Hi1, HNi-Hi2, HNi-Hi+1, Figs S5 and S6) confirm such dominant conformation of the fragment 1015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proximity of methyl groups of the residue V12 to the side chains of Y10 and H14 (Fig 2), observed in all three investigated peptides should also be noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the fragment 1015 in all three peptides has the same dominant structure, which can determine zinc-trapping properties of the metal binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aggregation_states_of_H6R-116__isoD7-116_and_616_in_the_presence_of_zinc_ions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The peptides behave differently in the presence of Zn2+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of equimolar amounts of zinc ions to the peptides isoD7-116, 616 and 116 resulted in precipitation of the peptides in contrast to H6R-116, which remained in solution in the studied concentration range (up to ~10mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations show that isoD7-116, 616 and 116 undergo zinc-induced oligo- and/or polymerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precipitated peptides dissolve in acidic conditions (pHless_than4), but precipitate again upon the increase of pH above ~6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such pH dependence indicates involvement of histidine residues in zinc binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precipitation of isoD7-116 has been observed at peptide concentration above ~0.3mM, 616 above ~0.8mM and 116 above ~5mM (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DLS studies evidence the presence of soluble zinc-induced oligomers during precipitation of the peptides (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that soluble zinc-induced oligomers precede insoluble aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR studies of the interaction of isoD7-116 and 616 with Zn2+ ions have been carried out at concentration below ~0.3mM, where both peptides remain soluble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Addition of Zn2+ ions to all studied peptides leads to substantial line broadening of the NMR signals (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nature of the peptide signal broadening primarily is associated with the exchange between multiple conformational states of the complex46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potentially the aggregation processes can also cause signal broadening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent of line broadening for peptide H6R-116 that never aggregated, and the peptides that aggregate is virtually the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that aggregation does not affect NMR line widths of these peptides under the given conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, an extra set of resonances (Figs 3 and 4, S2 and S3, S8) has been found in NMR spectra of the peptides 116, H6R-116, isoD7-116 and 616 in the presence of zinc ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This set has been assigned to the dimeric peptide complexes (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Zinc-induced_dimers_of_116__616__H6R-116_and_isoD7-116_have_common_zinc-mediated_dimerization_interface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously showed by a combination of NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and surface plasmon resonance methods that a stable dimeric form of the peptide H6R-116 is formed when bound to a zinc ion36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues E11 and H14 of the two peptide subunits formed the dimerization interface in this complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the dimeric form of H6R-116 a set of characteristic signals was observed in NMR spectra, including marked resonances of the methyl group H1* of V12 (~0.2 ppm) and amide proton of H14 (~9.5 ppm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity of these signals made it possible to evaluate the dimer ratio, which is dependent on the total peptide concentration and varied between 13% for the diluted solutions and 3540% for the solutions of H6R-116 at the peptide concentration of 58mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A comparison of the NMR spectra of the peptides 116, 616, H6R-116 and isoD7-116 in the presence of zinc ions obtained in this study has shown a set of characteristic signals similar to that observed in the work cited above, for all these peptides (Fig 3, S3, S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low concentration of the peptides 116, H6R-116 and isoD7-116 (~0.2 mM) fraction of the dimeric form is nearly identical (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fraction of the dimeric forms rises with concentration of the peptides as expected for any dimerization process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such tendency has been shown for H6R-11636, which has the highest dimer abundance among the studied peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The common set of characteristic signals found for the dimers of 116, 616, H6R-116 and isoD7-116 indicates that all the dimers have the same zinc-induced dimerization interface, namely, 11EVHH14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Equilibrium_between_zinc-bound_monomers_and_dimers_of_116_isoforms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Equilibrium between free peptide and its zinc-bound monomer complex is fast on the NMR time scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, equilibrium between zinc-bound monomers and dimers is slow on the NMR time scale, as evidenced by the two separate sets of NMR signals (Fig 3, 4, S2,S3,S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exchange between monomers and dimers is unambiguously confirmed by the rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) since cross-peaks originating from the through-space dipole-dipole interaction (NOE) have opposite signs to the cross-peaks derived from chemical exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4 illustrates NOEs between S8 H and H protons (negative, blue), and exchange cross peaks between several H signals of monomeric and dimeric forms (red, positive).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exchange between zinc-bound monomers and dimers of H6R-116 and isoD7-116 is also confirmed by characteristic cross-peaks in the NOESY spectra (Fig S8) demonstrating exchange between V12 H1* signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both peptides show identical patterns of NMR signals and differ only by fraction of the dimeric forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rate constants kmd and kdm at equilibrium between the monomeric and dimeric complexes of H6R-116 with Zn2+ have been measured using the magnetization transfer NMR experiments (see Supporting information pp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S24-S28 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been found that an effective rate constant kmd measured at the total peptide concentration of 2.3mM in the presence of half molar equivalence of ZnCl2 equals to 8.6±0.6s1 and kdm equals to 31.3±2.3s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structure_of_zinc-mediated_H6R-116_dimer_in_solution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Significant ratio of stable (on NMR time scale) zinc-bound H6R-116 dimers allowed to determine the dimer structure in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NMR structure has been determined using the set of distance restraints collected from 2D NOESY and ROESY spectra and a set of constraints between zinc ion and residues E11 and H14 (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to NOEs between the signals of the dimer, NOEs between the signals of zinc-bound monomer have been also included in the list of distance restraints used for structure calculation (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the equilibrium between zinc-bound monomer and dimer, more intensive signals of monomer (Fig 5) contain all the information about interatomic distances within the dimer via the transferred NOE mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar transferred NOE mechanism is observed in the equilibrium between free peptide and its complex with a larger protein49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effectiveness of such mechanism is determined by the substantially more effective cross-relaxation in dimer due to its slower molecular tumbling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
QM/MM calculations have been carried out to determine the restraints that describe geometry of the zinc-mediated interface formed by pairs of E11 and H14 from the interacting subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An approach similar to that described earlier for the determination of NMR structure of rat 116 complex with zinc ions47 has been used in the calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tetrahedral geometry of the zinc ion coordination sphere originated from quantum mechanics calculations (Fig S12B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such geometry is in good agreement with the principles governing Zn binding in proteins50 and in agreement with the previously determined structures of 116 zinc-bound complexes11,17,34,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Single set of zinc-bound dimer chemical shifts indicates that dimer subunits are chemically equivalent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, each NOE has been assumed to represent either intra-chain correlation or correlation between two adjacent subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All NOEs have been treated in the structure calculations as ambiguous distance restraints allowing optimization protocol to find optimal assignments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A family of 20 NMR structures has been determined on the basis of 181 experimental restraints (see Table 1 for details) using simulated annealing MD protocol in explicit water environment51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For most of the residues, the number of NOEs per residue is between 15 and 40 (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistics of the final ensemble are given in Table 1 and superposition of the final family of calculated structures is presented in Fig S10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A representative structure was selected from the ensemble of calculated structures as being the one that is closest to all the other structures and thus gives the lowest sum of pairwise RMSD for the remainder of the structures in the family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RMSD between the family of calculated structures and the representative structure is about 2.3Å for the backbone heavy atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RMSD between the structures in the final family for heavy atoms of the dimerization interface core (residues 815) is about 1.0Å (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Ramachandran plot (Fig S11), 73.5% of the residues in the whole NMR family are in the most favored regions and none in the disallowed regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative structure has been additionally optimized using the QM/MM method in order to refine the geometry of Zn2+ environment (Figs 6 and S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_the_second_zinc-dependent_dimerization_interface_within_116__616_and_isoD7-116  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peptides H6R-116, 116, isoD7-116 and 616 have identical primary zinc-mediated homodimerization interface, which shows characteristic resonances, such as H1* of V12 (Figs 3 and S3, S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the interface, pairs of residues E11 and H14 of the interacting subunits coordinate a common zinc ion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of equimolar amounts of zinc ions only H6R-116 does not precipitate up to 10mM, whereas the other peptides rapidly precipitate when their concentration reaches threshold values ( greater than 5mM for 116,  greater than 0.2mM for isoD7-116,  greater than 0.8mM for 616) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apparently, precipitation can occur only if an oligomer subunit possesses at least two sites that sterically can be involved in the formation of zinc-mediated interfaces with other peptide subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the 116, 616 and isoD7-116 peptides must have a second dimerization interface located within the  minimal zinc binding site 61434.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that aggregation of H6R-116 is not observed at any peptide concentration as shown in Table 1, clearly indicates the involvement of residue H6 in the second zinc-dependent interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that side chains of residues Asp, Glu  His are typical zinc chelators and E11  H14 are part of the primary dimerization interface, one can rationally assume that the second dimerization interface should include residues D7 (isoD7) or H13 in addition to H6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To probe involvement of isoD7 in the second dimerization interface we have studied a capacity of the model peptide isoD7-110 to form dimers in the presence of zinc ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have performed NMR titration experiments using the method of continuous variations36,38,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that stoichiometry of interaction of isoD7-110 with Zn2+ is 1:1 (Fig S13B, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coordination centers of zinc ion in the monomeric complex with isoD7-110 have been identified from changes of the chemical shifts between free and zinc-bound states (Fig S14, Tables S5, S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to imidazole ring of H6, Zn2+ is coordinated by the side chain carboxyl group of isoD7 and two backbone carbonyl groups of the residues F4 and H6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical shift changes data (Fig S15) allowed to calculate the binding constant of Zn2+ to isoD7-110, Ka=1.19±0.06·103M1 (Fig S13A, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data show that the peptide forms a monomeric complex with zinc ion and thus isoD7 is not involved in the second dimerization interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarly, to probe involvement of residue H13 in the second dimerization interface we have studied the model peptide isoD7-H13R-116.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H13R substitution has been designed to minimize changes in the peptide properties relative to isoD7-116.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical shifts of the peptide in the presence and absence of zinc ions are given in Supplementary material (Tables S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR studies of the interaction of isoD7-H13R-116 with Zn2+ (Fig S16) have shown zinc binding constant Ka=1.35±0.06·103M1 (Fig S17A, Table 1) and stoichiometry (1:1) (Fig S17B, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zinc-induced chemical shift changes (Fig S18) indicate that side chains of the two histidine residues (H6 and H14) are involved in the coordination of Zn2+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical shifts of E11 do not change upon interaction of the peptide with Zn2+, suggesting that this residue is not involved in its coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RMSD of the 1H and 13C chemical shifts between the free and zinc-bound peptides (Fig S18) indicate that zinc ion is coordinated by backbone carbonyl groups of the residues H6 and R5, similarly to that observed earlier in the S8 phophorylated A116 peptide38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, the described data show that in zinc-induced oligomers of the 116, 616 and isoD7-116 peptides each subunit interacts with the adjacent subunits via residues E11 and H14 from the primary dimerization interface, and residues H6 and H13 from the second one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_origins_of_higher_oligomerization_propensity_of_isoD7-116_and_616_compared_to_116  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our experimental results indicate that isomerization of D7 as well as truncation of the first five residues facilitate formation of the second Zn-dependent interaction site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand why a relatively small change of the peptide structure between 116 and isoD7-116 causes dramatic change in their zinc-induced oligomerization, MD simulations have been performed for homodimer A116·A116 and heterodimer A116·isoD7-A116.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conformational behavior of A116 and isoD7-A116 chains in the respective homodimer and heterodimer, has been examined in MD trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the MD simulations the primary zinc-dependent interface structure has been kept in its initial conformation, and distances between the imidazole rings of residues H6 and H13 in the second interface in both A116 and isoD7-A116 chains have been constrained in order to keep them close enough for zinc ion coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MD simulations have shown that residues D7 and S8 in the A116 chain form a stable bend (RMSD over N, C and C atoms of residues 7 and 8 was 0.13Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such bend is stabilized by hydrogen bond between the D7 side-chain carboxyl and S8 side-chain hydroxyl (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the isoD7-A116 chain residues D7 and S8 do not form a bend, but demonstrate a propensity to form extended conformation (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, structural changes associated with the isomerization of D7 (elongation of the peptide backbone by one additional CH2 group and reduction of the side-chain) lead to disruption of the interaction between residues D7 and S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MD results show that in both peptides 116 and isoD7-116, residues H6 and H13 adopt a conformation supporting interaction with Zn2+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, probability to adopt the most favorable conformation is higher for the isoD7-116 peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, such conformational space in 116 peptide is restricted due to the bent region 78 (Fig S19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, isomerization of D7 increases capacity of the residues H6 and H13 to form the second zinc-dependent interface interaction with zinc ion, which facilitates oligomerization of the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Truncation of the first five residues of 116 forms the 616 peptide with increased conformational freedom of the N-terminal residue H6 and similarly facilitates zinc-induced oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In human tissues, A is a group of peptides, heterogenous at their N-termini and/or C-termini and produced by the - and -secretase-dependent cleavage of amyloid precursor protein53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural characterization of the full lenght A monomer in solution is difficult due to the tendency of the peptide to aggregate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was found that the soluble A142 peptide is an intrinsically disordered polypeptide in aqueous solution, having -strand secondary structure within the segments 27, 1623, 2832, and 343654.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid-state NMR spectroscopy and electron microscopy allowed to identify diverse morphologies and structures in A fibrils (reviewed in55,56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metal-binding domain 116 was found to be flexible, situated outside of the hydrophobic core formed by the residues 174220,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that the absence of this domain in the so called p3 peptide, which comprises the A region 1742, prevents the formation of oligomers57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another fact that three amino acid substitutions that discern A of rats and mice from all other mammals and protect rodents against AD are situated within the metal binding domain, indicating its involvement in initialization of the pathological A aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several AD-causing mutations are also located in the metal binding domain of A59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A role of A116 in the AD pathology is that it is required for the formation of zinc-induced oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies targeting the N-terminal region of A are able to block the formation of A40 amyloids61, thus suggesting that the N-terminal domain contributes to the formation and/or the maturation of A fibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results indicate that conformation of the 1015 region of the metal binding domain in absence of zinc ions is identical in all studied variants of A116, and that it is likely to be pre-formed for an effective zinc ion trapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region 1114 was shown to play a principle role in Zn2+ binding in the monomeric complex17,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such interaction includes two consecutive steps, (i) primary zinc ion binding by side chains of the residues E11, H13, H14 and a water molecule, (ii) substitution of water by the residue H6 due to movement of the fragments 18 and 1114 towards each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It was suggested that a zinc ion binds to monomeric A and then the zinc-peptide complex undergoes conformational changes that lead to the formation in the formation of zinc-induced A oligomers11,21,62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of 11EVHH14 fragment in the formation of A dimers was reported previously11,36,37,38,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study we have established the three-dimensional structure of a zinc-linked dimer of H6R-116, with the dimerization interface formed by the side chains of residues E11 and H14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues 1015 also contribute to structure stabilization by hydrophobic interactions between Y10 and V12, and by forming hydrogen bonds between the HN protons of H14 and Gln15 and the backbone carbonyl groups of E11 and V12 respectively (Fig 6, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low field shifts of these two amide protons are in agreement with this conclusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characteristic high field shift of the resonance of H1*of V12 originates from its proximity to the aromatic ring of Y10 in the hydrophobic core and additionally validates the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, binding of a zinc ion to the 11EVHH14 fragment leads to formation of the peptide dimer where one zinc ion is coordinated by the residues E11 and H14 from the two interacting peptide chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Miller et al.62 discuss two possible scenarios of the zinc-induced amyloidogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first one, metal ions bind amyloid monomers and induce their assembly into oligomers via interactions of the zinc-bound complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative mechanism presumes that metal ions bind to pre-formed apo-oligomers of A. Lim et al.13 showed that zinc binding to A initiates a cascade of conformational changes leading to intermolecular interactions of A via residues 1221.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After an initial structure rearrangement caused by zinc binding, the C-terminal residues readjust their conformation to support effective intermolecular interaction18,21,47,57,58,59,61,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar structural changes of the metal-free A140 peptides were also observed in the presence of the preformed oligomers13, suggesting that such conformational transitions may constitute a general molecular mechanism of the A amyloidogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown here for A116 and isoD7-A116 that formation of the primary zinc-dependent dimerization interface by residues E11 and H14 initiates conformational rearrangement leading to formation of the second dimerization interface by residues H6 and H13 (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emergence of this second interface is a key event enabling zinc-induced oligomerization of the metal binding domain (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If a zinc-induced dimer is formed by native A116 via primary interface, it restricts conformational mobility of the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that this can result in disruption of the reciprocal aligning of residues 6 and 13 necessary to form the second interface, leading to lower fraction of peptides with both interfaces (Fig S19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains moderate susceptibility of the native peptide A116 to oligomerization (A116 precipitates at concentrations  greater than 5mM, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison with A116, isoD7-A116 undergoes oligomerization at substantially higher rate (isoD7-A116 precipitates at concentrations  greater than 0.3mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isomerization of D7 considerably increases conformational space of the peptide backbone and facilitates favorable aligning of the side chains of residues H6 and H13 that form the second dimerization interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another way to increase conformational freedom of the H6 side chain is to remove the first five residues of A, including residues E1 and D3 capable of electrostatically interacting with H634.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, peptide A616 precipitates at ~0.8mM (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, enzymatic removal of the first five A residues is performed by ACE66 as we showed earlier, which can potentially link ACE to Alzheimers disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results obtained in this study allow to propose the molecular mechanism of zinc-dependent oligomerization of A metal binding domain (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oligomerization starts with formation of zinc-peptide monomeric complex (Fig 8b), and subsequent transformation of the complex to a dimer (Fig 8c), where zinc ion is coordinated by the side chains of residues E11 and H14 from the interacting peptide molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this, conformational rearrangement in the segments 614 of each subunit leads to formation of the second zinc-dependent dimerization interface composed of residues H6 and H13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimer becomes a seed of subsequent zinc-dependent oligomerization leading to formation of higher order soluble oligomers that are transformed into insoluble aggregates (Fig 8d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast with the earlier concepts of polymorphism of A within zinc-dependent oligomers, our data suggest that the A metal binding domain has a distinct three-dimensional structure, allowing the domain to simultaneously interact with two other A molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could trigger a chain reaction of zinc-induced A oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is in line with our recent in vivo studies showing that synthetic peptides specifically binding the A 11EVHH14 region and preventing zinc-induced A dimerization, significantly reduce progression of cerebral amyloidosis in transgenic mice67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have demonstrated that in the A metal binding domains of intact, H6R mutant and the isoD7 A isoforms in the absence and presence of zinc ions, the dominant backbone conformation of the fragment 1015 is identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fragment forms primary zinc-mediated dimerization interface of all studied metal binding domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solution structure of zinc-mediated H6R-116 dimer has been determined, providing insight into the mechanism of formation of the dimerization interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zinc-induced oligomerization of synthetic peptides representing the 116 metal binding domains of natural  variants has been shown to follow the same molecular mechanism: (i) peptide dimer is formed through the primary zinc-mediated interface 11EVHH14; (ii) residues H6 and H13 are realigned creating the second zinc-dependent interface in each subunit; (iii) the dimer becomes a seed of subsequent zinc-dependent oligomerization of A116.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that the extent of conformational freedom of residue H6 determines the propensity of A116 isoforms to undergo zinc-induced oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting of A zinc-mediated interfaces may provide a therapeutic route for AD treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
