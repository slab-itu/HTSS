Chemical State Mapping of Degraded B4C Control Rod Investigated with Soft X-ray Emission Spectrometer in Electron Probe Micro-analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
B4C is widely used as control rods in light water reactors, such as the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, because it shows excellent neutron absorption and has a high melting point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, B4C can melt at lower temperatures owing to eutectic interactions with stainless steel and can even evaporate by reacting with high-temperature steam under severe accident conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce the risk of recriticality, a precise understanding of the location and chemical state of B in the melt core is necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that a novel soft X-ray emission spectrometer in electron probe microanalysis can help to obtain a chemical state map of B in a modeled control rod after a high-temperature steam oxidation test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Control rods used in boiled-water reactors (BWRs) in Japan, including all units at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (NPP), consist of stainless steel tubes filled with B4C granules1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B4C is stable at the normal NPP operating temperature of ~300°C, as it melts at 2450°C2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the eutectic interaction of B4C with the adjacent stainless steel leads to its liquefaction at temperatures exceeding 1200°C under severe accidental conditions1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance of this liquid phase causes the phenomenon of candling and relocation, in which the liquid phase sinks to the bottom of the nuclear core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proper pouring of cooling water is necessary to prevent achieving recriticality when B is not available as a neutron absorber at the upper part of the core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the oxidation of B4C by high-temperature steam may first form B2O3 and then gaseous boric acids (HBO2 and H3BO4)3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The release of these gases may affect the source term of radioactive materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the prediction and evaluation of B and the chemical state thereof is necessary to control accidents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The spatial distribution of B in B4C after severe accidental simulation tests has been analyzed mainly by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) with wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS)1,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these conventional methods do not easily provide chemical state information, as they are limited by insufficient energy resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although soft X-ray emission or absorption spectrometry, using synchrotron radiation facilities, may provide an understanding of the chemical state of B6,7, it is not economically viable to simultaneously obtain a detailed spatial distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we demonstrate the chemical state mapping of B in a modeled B4C control rod after a high-temperature steam oxidation test using the newly developed EPMA-soft X-ray emission spectrometer (SXES) with ultra-high energy resolutions8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EPMA-SXES is a type of WDS that performs a parallel collection of soft X-ray spectra by a combination of an aberration-corrected grating system and a high-sensitivity X-ray charge-coupled device (CCD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, EPMA-SXES permits the spectral mapping of light elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Figure 1 shows the soft X-ray emission spectra of B-K from B-containing crystalline materials such as (a) B2O3, (b) B, (c) B4C, (d) Fe2B, and (e) FeB as references for EPMA-SXES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra were normalized by the maximum intensity of each B-K peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported in the Handbook of X-Ray Data10, the B-K peak is observed at 183.5eV for B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B-K peak of B4C shifts to a slightly higher energy at 184eV and shows a characteristic shape with decreased intensity at lower-energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in the spectral shape is attributed to the bonding of B and C within B4C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra of the iron borides FeB and Fe2B depict clear shoulders, designated as Sat.2 in the upper horizontal axis of Fig 1, near 187eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These shoulders relate to the Fermi level of the material, as the electron behavior of B in iron borides is more metallic than that in the pure element11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shoulders may also relate to the slightly higher energy of the peak of Fe2B than those of B and FeB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, B2O3 shows a distinctly different spectral shape compared to that of the other B-containing materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B-K peak of B2O3 experiences a large shift to a lower energy at 180.5eV and the formation of two additional satellite peaks: one higher (Sat.3: 192.5eV) and one lower (Sat.1: 166eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Muramatsu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  revealed that the higher-energy satellite peak originated from resonant X-ray Raman scattering and linked the lower-energy satellite peak to a transition from the B 2p and O 2s molecular orbitals to a core hole at the B 1s orbital12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we consider that EPMA-SXES has a sufficiently high energy resolution to determine the chemical state of B from the changes in the spectral shape of the B-K peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Figure 2 shows (ag) elemental mapping results obtained by conventional EPMA-WDS, (h) a secondary electron image, and (i) a back-scattering electron image on the cross-section of the B4C control rod model after exposure to high-temperature steam at 1250°C for 30min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although B4C and stainless steel reacted significantly, B4C granules remain in the red- and pink-colored region in the (d) B map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alloying elements of stainless steel such as Fe, Cr, and Ni are observed within the stainless tube where the B4C granules were placed before the oxidation test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these area also contains some amounts of B, liquefaction by eutectic interactions between B4C and stainless steel occurs under the high-temperature oxidation testing condition; the liquid solidifies as the test temperature is decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electron images (h,i) show that the peripheral vicinity of the remaining B4C granule comprises a layer of reaction products from B4C with stainless steel and/or steam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elemental maps show that the peripheral vicinity of the remaining B4C contains relatively dense O and C. The chemical state information of B will determine whether these are from B2O3 formed by the oxidation of B4C or from other oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 3, we show the EPMA-SXES measurement result of (ac) a B elemental map for the same position as Fig 2 and (d) B-K spectra from the points A through K, as designated in the elemental map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B-K spectra (solid lines) for the points of the remaining B4C granule present the characteristic peak shape of B4C, as shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the B-K spectra (dotted lines) for the points farther from the remaining B4C granule exhibit a unique shoulder at ~187eV, similar to the shoulders in the spectra of the iron borides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, EPMA-SXES supports that B in B4C reacts with the stainless steel to form borides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the peak of O-K (n=3) is also observed near the B4C particle, the shape of the B-K peak differs from that of B2O3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the O near the B4C granule probably results from other metal oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the reaction process of the B4C control rod model after high-temperature steam oxidation testing, it is beneficial to visualize the chemical distribution of B in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To clarify the chemical state, the elemental maps shown in Fig 3(ac) are re-calculated by the areal ratios of the peaks; PA is the total area of B-K in the range 178188eV, PB is the area from 178 to 186eV, and PC is the area in 186188eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3(e,f) show the chemical state maps obtained by calculating PB/PA and PC/PA, which display the existing areas of B4C and borides separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, we succeeded in identifying the chemical state of B and in visualizing the spatial distribution of B with associated chemical states in the degraded B4C control rod model, based on EPMA-SXES with ultrahigh energy resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings will aid the establishment of severe accident simulation codes and the prediction of the chemical state and physical location of B in the Fukushima Daiichi NPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we emphasize that the present lab-scale SXES by EPMA has excellent energy-resolution and higher spatial resolution not only for light elements but also for higher atomic number elements compared with SXES by synchrotron radiation facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EPMA-SXES permits the visualization of the chemical state of elements in various materials at the micro-scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reference_materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Five B-containing crystalline materials were prepared; B granules (37mm) and B2O3 powder were purchased from Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd. FeB and Fe2B (500m in diameter) were purchased from Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd. B4C granules were supplied by a domestic BWR manufacturer in Japan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemical compositions were shown elsewhere7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

High-temperature_steam_oxidation_test  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a control rod model containing B4C granules7 as neutron absorbers, SUS304L as cladding tube, SUS316L as control rod blade, and Zircaloy-4 as the channel box material as shown in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B4C granules were placed in the cladding tubes, which are 0.6mm in thickness, 4.8mm in outer diameter and 20mm in length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vibration method was used for filling B4C granules with a packing density of approximately 70%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the ends of the tubes were sealed with setscrews of SUS304.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three sets of stainless steel tubes filled with B4C were sandwiched by the control rod blade material (SUS316L) and the channel box material (Zircaloy-4), which was coated with an oxide film of approximately 20m in thickness on the surface, equivalent to that formed on the actual component by exposure to water vapor at 1000°C for 10min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high-temperature steam oxidation test was performed on the model for 30min at 1250°C, at which point the eutectic interaction of B4C and stainless steel is known to be rapid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heating of the model was performed by a horizontal electric furnace using a KERAMAX (LaCrO3) heater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firstly, the model was set on a sample table located in a low-temperature part of the reaction tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, the furnace was kept at the target temperature under flowing humidified Ar gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirdly, the sample table was moved into the high-temperature part of the reaction tube using a heat-resistant push rod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30min in this region, the test was completed by transferring the sample stage, using the push bar, to the opposite low-temperature region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ar gas was humidified by bubbling the Ar at 800cm3/min into a constant-temperature water bath kept at 70°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After the high-temperature steam oxidation test, the model was cut at the axial direction center position and embedded into resin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-section was polished with SiC papers and colloidal silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final surface of the cross-section was Pt-coated to prevent charge-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EPMA-WDS_and_SXES  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The polished sample was examined by a JXA-8500F field emission EPMA (JEOL) equipped with WDS and SXES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acceleration voltage and beam current of the scanning electron beam were 15keV and 5.5×107A, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy range of SXES was 54 to 220eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nominal energy resolution for SXES was 0.22eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5 shows the soft X-ray emission spectra of B-K from B granules obtained by a conventional WDS (type LDE2H) and the newly developed SXES (type JS200N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advantages of SXES in energy resolution are evident.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broad asymmetrical peak is characteristic of covalent bonding11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
