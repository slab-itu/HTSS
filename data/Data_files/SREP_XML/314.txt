Tumour endothelial cells in high metastatic tumours promote metastasis via epigenetic dysregulation of biglycan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tumour blood vessels are gateways for distant metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have revealed that tumour endothelial cells (TECs) demonstrate distinct phenotypes from their normal counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have demonstrated that features of TECs are different depending on tumour malignancy, suggesting that TECs communicate with surrounding tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the contribution of TECs to metastasis has not been elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that TECs actively promote tumour metastasis through a bidirectional interaction between tumour cells and TECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-implantation of TECs isolated from highly metastatic tumours accelerated lung metastases of low metastatic tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biglycan, a small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan secreted from TECs, activated tumour cell migration via nuclear factor-B and extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biglycan expression was upregulated by DNA demethylation in TECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our results demonstrate that TECs are altered in their microenvironment and, in turn, instigate tumour cells to metastasize, which is a novel mechanism for tumour metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tumour metastasis causes the high mortality rates that are associated with cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the first stage of the metastatic process, tumour cells migrate through a vascular wall (intravasation) and then travel to target organs1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumour blood vessels provide a route for distant metastasis3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, highly vascularized tumours exhibit high metastatic potential4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphologies and functions of tumour vasculatures are known to differ from those of their normal counterparts6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies, including ours, revealed that tumour endothelial cells (TECs), components of tumour blood vessels, also differ from normal endothelial cells (NECs) in various aspects, including their angiogenic properties8, gene expression profiles9 and responses to growth factors10,11 and chemotherapeutic drugs12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, TECs are cytogenetically abnormal15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently demonstrated the heterogeneity of TECs using two different types of these cells: HM-TECs from highly metastatic melanomas [HM-tumour, A375-SM (super-metastatic)] and LM-TECs from low metastatic melanomas (LM-tumour, A375).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HM-TECs exhibited greater pro-angiogenic activities than LM-TECs did, which was concomitant with the upregulation of angiogenesis-related genes14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that TECs acquired specific features in response to their surrounding environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we investigated the roles of TECs in tumour metastasis by utilizing the two aforementioned different tumour models (HM-tumours and LM-tumours) and the corresponding TECs (HM-TECs and LM-TECs) isolated from these tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide clear evidence that TECs actively promote tumour metastasis, particularly during intravasation, through the secretion of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan, biglycan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that biglycan expression was upregulated by DNA demethylation of its promoter region in TECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, to the best of our knowledge, these results demonstrate for the first time a novel mechanism for tumour metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HM-TECs_promote_tumour_cell_intravasation_and_metastases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LM-tumour and HM-tumour cells were subcutaneously xenografted into nude mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two melanoma cell lines were derived from identical human tumours but with significantly different metastatic potentials; A375 cells barely metastasize, whereas A375SM cells (generated from A375 cells by repeatedly re-inoculating metastasized tumour cells) develop lung metastases17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous reports17, more mice with HM-tumours than with LM-tumours developed lung metastases (Supplementary Fig S1A) and tumour cells were detected in intra-blood vessel areas of HM-tumours (Supplementary Fig S1B), which also demonstrated more angiogenic properties (Supplementary Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In hematogenous metastasis, tumour cells detach from the primary site and enter the blood vasculature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process of intravasation can be divided into three steps: 1) tumour cell migration toward endothelial cells (ECs), i.e., migration; 2) arrest on ECs, i.e., adhesion; and 3) migration through the endothelium, i.e., transendothelial migration18 (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated the involvement of TECs in these steps in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TECs were isolated from HM- and LM-tumours14,19 and NECs were isolated from the dermis of tumour-free nude mice (Supplementary Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The characteristics of these cells were confirmed as ECs through the expression of EC markers and the absence of human tumour cell contamination with the lack of hHB-EGF expression (Supplementary Fig S1ES1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumour cells migrated more efficiently toward HM-TECs than toward other ECs (Fig 1B,C and Supplementary Fig S2A,B), which suggested that a soluble factor(s) secreted by HM-TEC had attracted tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the adhesiveness of LM-tumour cells to monolayers of each type of EC was compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumour cells more efficiently adhered to a HM-TEC monolayer than they did to monolayers of the other ECs (Fig 1D,E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further analyse the groove under the EC monolayer of LM-tumour cells (an in vitro model of intravasation), a transendothelial migration assay20,21 was performed, in which the positional relationship between EC monolayers and tumour cells was classified into three different stages (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On NEC or LM-TEC monolayers, most tumour cells were observed to be in Stage 1 or 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, on HM-TEC monolayers, 40% of tumour cells were in Stage 3, which demonstrated that tumour transmigration was enhanced on the HM-TEC monolayer (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the contribution of each EC to transendothelial migration and subsequent intravasation and metastasis, LM-tumour cells and ECs were subcutaneously co-implanted into nude mice (Fig 1G and Supplementary Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood were evaluated by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest number of RFP-expressing CTCs was observed in mice bearing tumours co-implanted with HM-TECs (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no significant differences among the groups, but these results suggested that HM-TECs instigate LM-tumour cell metastasis by inducing intravasation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, Luciferase-LM-tumour cells and tdtomato-ECs (Supplementary Fig S2D) were co-xenografted and lung metastases were evaluated by IVIS Spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lung metastasis, which could not be observed when LM-tumour cells alone were subcutaneously inoculated (Fig 1I), was significantly increased from that with LM-TECs (1/4) or NECs (0/5) when a tumour was co-implanted with HM-TECs (3/5) (Fig 1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the tumour sizes were comparable among these groups (Supplementary Fig S2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean MVD of LM-tumours co-implanted with HM-TECs was the highest among all tumour groups (Supplementary Fig S2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In in vivo primary tumours, the red fluorescence signals originating from co-implanted ECs were detected in lectin-positive blood vessels to some extent (Fig 1J) and the vasculature comprising these ECs contained red blood cells (Fig 1K), which suggested that implanted ECs had participated in the formation of functional blood vessels in cooperation with the hosts vasculature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HM-TECs_express_high_levels_of_biglycan_via_demethylation_of_its_promoter_region  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By comparing the gene expression profiles of TECs and NECs, we previously identified biglycan among the upregulated genes, which is a secreted protein of small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that biglycan secreted from TECs induces their pro-angiogenic phenotype in an autocrine manner, such as cell migration23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biglycan expression was upregulated in HM-TECs relative to that in other ECs or other cell types, including HM- or LM-tumour cells (Fig 2A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, strong biglycan expression was observed in HM-tumour vessels, but was hardly observed in LM-tumour vessels or in normal skin vessels (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, biglycan was only detected in HM-TEC conditioned medium (CM) (Fig 2D and Supplementary Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biglycan levels in the plasma of HM-tumour-bearing mice were higher than those in the LM-tumour-bearing mice or non-tumour mice (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that HM-TECs secrete biglycan and attract tumour cells in a paracrine manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the differences between HM-TECs and LM-TECs in the tumour microenvironment, we speculated that HM-TECs acquired their specific characteristics from tumour-derived factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we cultured LM-TECs in CM derived from HM-tumour cells, LM-tumour cells, or LM-TECs (Control) for 2 days, after which biglycan mRNA expression was evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biglycan mRNA in LM-TECs was upregulated after treatment with HM-tumour-CM (Supplementary Fig S3B) and the number of migrating LM-tumour cells increased when HM-tumour CM-treated LM-TECs were plated in the lower chambers of transwells (Supplementary Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that LM-TECs acquire a HM-TEC-like phenotype under the influence of HM-tumour-derived factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biglycan upregulation in HM-TECs was maintained for several months, although all ECs had been cultured under the same conditions without the addition of any tumour-derived factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculated that this difference may be attributable to a difference in DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcription start site (TSS) in the biglycan promoter was identified using MethPrimer software24, and the DNA methylation status of the area around the TSS was examined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR; MSP) and a bisulfite sequencing analysis (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSP data revealed that the biglycan promoter in HM-TECs had markedly less methylation than that in other ECs (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, bisulfite sequencing showed that the biglycan promoter was significantly demethylated in HM-TECs (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biglycan expression was indeed increased when LM-TECs and NECs were treated with the demethylating agent 5-aza-dC (Fig 2I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that epigenetic modification causes biglycan upregulation in TECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HM-TEC-derived_biglycan_induces_tumour_cell_intravasation_and_metastasis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether enhanced tumour metastasis by HM-TECs was due to biglycan, biglycan expression in HM-TECs was stably knocked down (Supplementary Fig S3D,E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LM-tumour cells were then subcutaneously implanted with either control- or biglycan knockdown-HM-TECs (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected plasma samples from mice and the plasma biglycan levels were analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-implantation of control HM-TECs with LM-tumours resulted in increased plasma biglycan levels (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when shBiglycan HM-TECs were co-implanted, the plasma biglycan levels were reduced (Fig 3B and Supplementary Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that co-implanted HM-TECs are a source of increased biglycan in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice bearing tumours co-implanted with shBiglycan HM-TECs, the numbers of CTCs and the occurrence of lung metastasis were dramatically decreased from those in the control group (Fig 3C,D and Supplementary Fig S3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support our aforementioned results that HM-TEC-derived biglycan induces LM-tumour cells to metastasize.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the MVD of tumours co-implanted with shBiglycan HM-TECs decreased (Supplementary Fig S3H), which suggests that biglycan from the ECs induced tumour angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biglycan_enhances_tumour_cell_migration_through_the_activation_of_NF-B_and_ERK_signalling_via_TLRs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tumour cells expressed the biglycan receptors Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR425,26 (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biglycan protein enhanced tumour cell migration (Fig 3F) and this was inhibited by neutralizing the biglycan receptors using an anti-TLR2 or anti-TLR4 antibody (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results further confirmed that tumour cells are attracted by biglycan via TLR2 and TLR4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both TLRs seems to be involved in tumour cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since there were no additive effects by inhibition of both TLR2 and TLR4, it was suggested that one of these TLRs may be sufficient for tumour cells to utilize biglycan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When biglycan was knocked down in HM-TECs, tumour cell migration towards HM-TECs was significantly decreased (Fig 3G), thereby establishing the requirement for TEC-derived biglycan for tumour cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, tumour cell adhesion to a monolayer of biglycan-knockdown HM-TECs did not change (Supplementary Fig S3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To clarify the potential intracellular signalling cascade by which biglycan stimulates tumour cell migration, we investigated the effects of biglycan on the activation of NF-B and ERK 1 and 2, known downstream biglycan signalling pathways25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumour cell migration toward biglycan was inhibited by the NF-B inhibitor BAY11-7082 (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biglycan-treated tumour cells showed significant increases in NF-B activity, whereas this induction was attenuated by pretreatment with TLR2 and/or TLR4 inhibitors (Fig 3I), suggesting that biglycan-induced tumour cell migration was mediated by NF-B activation through TLRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, pretreatment of tumour cells with U0126, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) 1 and 2, decreased the number of tumour cells migrating toward biglycan (Fig 3J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced activation of ERK1/2 in biglycan-stimulated tumour cells was abolished by preincubation with U0126 or TLR2 and/or TLR4 inhibitors (Fig 3K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest that the NF-B and ERK pathways are involved in enhanced tumour cell migration by biglycan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tumour_blood_vessels_of_patients_with_cancer_express_biglycan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relationship between the gene expression and prognosis of patients with various cancers is available from the PrognoScan database27, a large collection of publicly available cancer microarray datasets with clinical backgrounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4A, we found that high biglycan expression was correlated with a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer28, lung cancer29 and colorectal cancer30 (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Cox p-value was not significant in lung cancer, the minimum p-value used to find the cutpoint showed this trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma biglycan levels in patients with cancer (Table 2) were higher than those in healthy volunteers (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among all samples tested, including those of patients with nonmetastatic cancer, the highest biglycan levels were found in patients with metastases (Fig 4B, red columns).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, high biglycan expression may positively correlate with tumour progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the source of biglycan expression, we further assessed biglycan expression in individual cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong biglycan expression was detected in tumour blood endothelial cells of a metastatic case (case number 16) but was barely detected in the tumour tissues of a nonmetastatic case (case number 11) (Fig 4C and Supplementary Fig S3J,K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since biglycan is a secreted proteoglycan, biglycan was also stained in the surrounding areas of blood vessels in metastatic cases, which has been described in previous reports31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that biglycan in TECs is also involved in tumour metastasis in patients with cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we demonstrated that TECs isolated from high-metastatic tumours promoted lung metastasis of tumours that rarely metastasize on their own.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumour cell intravasation was enhanced by TEC-derived biglycan and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of biglycan was regulated by DNA demethylation, indicating a bidirectional interaction between tumour cells and TECs in the tumour microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, TECs are altered by the tumour microenvironment, which, in turn, creates a local milieu more favourable for tumour metastasis, including facilitated tumour intravasation (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Much remains to be elucidated regarding the determinants for tumour metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of studies conducted during recent decades have challenged this paradigm by addressing tumour cell-autonomous mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it remains difficult to predict metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumour size and the histological grade, as evaluated by pathological examination, are not always linked with metastatic status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations encouraged us to examine the role of tumour stromal cells, as we focused on the properties of TECs in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence gathered to date indicates that tumour stromal cells, such as cancer associated fibroblasts, promote tumour progression after co-implantation of these cells with tumour cells32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TECs, a type of tumour stromal cells, also exhibit aberrant behaviours15,34 and physically make contact with tumour cells during tumour metastasis (intravasation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, studies that evaluated the possibility that TECs affect tumour progression, particularly metastasis, have been limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the TEC population is approximately only 2%8, we co-implanted TECs (2% of tumour cells) in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate that even a small number of TECs display significant differences in metastatic potential and implicates TECs as strong environmental determinants of the metastatic potential of tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we have previously shown that TECs from tumours with different metastatic potential had distinct properties14, it was not clear whether these phenotypic differences indeed contributed to specific aspects of tumour metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among previously reported TEC markers, we identified biglycan expressed in HM-TECs as a key molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experimental tumour model, both HM- and LM-tumour cells secreted vanishingly low levels of biglycan1, which established it as a suitable model for analysing the roles of biglycan derived from cells other than tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data revealed that TECs and other stromal cells, but not tumour cells, expressed biglycan in HM-tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biglycan promoted tumour cell migration, and biglycan knockdown in HM-TECs inhibited tumour migration toward HM-TECs and decreased numbers of CTC and tumour metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that biglycan secreted from HM-TECs mediates tumour cell intravasation and subsequent metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the increased biglycan levels in plasma from mice with LM-tumour cells/HM-TECs was significantly reduced by biglycan knockdown in HM-TECs, HM-TECs are crucially involved in the induction of biglycan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently identified biglycan as a novel TEC marker contributing to the proangiogenic phenotype of TECs in an autocrine manner23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biglycan is a component of the extracellular matrix, but is known to be released from activated macrophages in inflammatory and fibrotic tissues25,35,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biglycan has the capacity to bind transforming growth factor- (TGF-)38, tumour necrosis factor-39 and bone morphogenetic protein-440.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, stromal biglycan appears to modulate the biological activities of a variety of growth factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is still unknown whether biglycan secreted from TECs has the same function or not, the role of biglycan secreted from TECs is worth investigating in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, biglycan may also act as a chemoattractant for tumour cells, in addition to TECs23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because it is a secreted protein and regulates inflammatory responses via its cognate TLR receptors in these situations25, we hypothesized that TEC-secreted biglycan attracted tumour cells in a paracrine manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this view, the tumour cells utilized in this study expressed TLR2 and TLR4, and neutralizing antibodies against these receptors indeed inhibited tumour cell migration toward biglycan, which suggested a common mechanism for biglycan to activate cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B and ERK are involved in the intracellular signalling cascades of biglycan in macrophages through TLRs25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, both NF-B and ERK were involved in tumour cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in HM-tumour tissues, increased numbers of macrophages from those in LM-tumour tissues were detected when analysed by F4/80 staining (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macrophages are reported to be involved in tumour progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, macrophages may be mobilized by TEC-derived biglycan and this may contribute to tumour metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of biglycan in macrophage mobilization and its consequence require further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HM-tumour CM treatment upregulated the expression of biglycan in LM-TECs and made LM-TECs attract more tumour cells, indicating a bidirectional interaction between tumour cells and TECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that TGF- upregulates biglycan41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, HM-tumour cells do not express TGF- (data not shown), thus there may be another factor secreted from HM-tumours which causes upregulation of biglycan in TECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sustained high levels of biglycan expression in HM-TECs in culture encouraged us to analyse the epigenetic changes of a biglycan promoter in HM-TECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Few reports have examined epigenetic differences in NECs and TECs44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there are few reports on the consequences of methylation of those genes in ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time differences in the DNA methylation patterns of biglycan between low- and high-metastatic tumour-derived ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the tumour microenvironment affects the epigenome in TECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms underlying the epigenetic alterations remain unknown, even in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the mechanisms underlying our findings are not yet clear, and further analysis is warranted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our findings provide a new prospect for understanding the mechanisms underlying abnormality in cancer stroma cells such as TECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have reported that biglycan expression in TECs is not limited to murine melanoma models but is also found in several other human solid tumours such as lung cancer and renal cancers23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, high plasma concentrations of biglycan were observed in patients with colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas with the highest concentrations in those with metastatic lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In breast, lung and colorectal cancers, high biglycan expression was correlated with poor prognosis by meta-analyses using PrognoScan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest a universal role for biglycan in facilitating metastasis across a wide range of tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the detailed molecular mechanisms by which tumour cells acquire their metastatic potential remain to be determined, our results provide the first clear evidence for the importance of the different properties of TECs for determining tumour progression and/or malignancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumour blood vessels act as a gate for metastasis (during intravasation of tumour cells), which is guarded by TECs as gatekeepers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TECs in highly metastatic tumours are thereby provided with a key molecule, biglycan, through DNA hypomethylation to allow tumour cells to break through this gate and proceed into the blood stream, which results in hematogenous metastasis (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present observations, together with unravelling certain remaining issues, may contribute to establishing accurate diagnostics or potent antimetastatic strategies that target the communications between tumour cells and endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell_culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human malignant melanoma A375 cells (LM-tumour) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A375SM (super-metastatic) cells (HM-tumour) were kindly provided by Dr. Fidler (M.D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anderson Cancer Centre, Houston, TX, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HM-tumour cells were established by in vivo selection of pulmonary metastatic lesions in nude mice and eventually display significantly high metastatic potentials, relative to those of the parental A375 cells17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, GIBCO) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NIH3T3 and RAW264.7 cells were purchased from ATCC and DS Pharma Biomedical, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells were cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of Mycoplasma pulmonis was checked by PCR at the ICLAS Monitoring Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
