Plug-and-Display: decoration of Virus-Like Particles via isopeptide bonds for modular immunization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Virus-like particles (VLPs) are non-infectious self-assembling nanoparticles, useful in medicine and nanotechnology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their repetitive molecularly-defined architecture is attractive for engineering multivalency, notably for vaccination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, decorating VLPs with target-antigens by genetic fusion or chemical modification is time-consuming and often leads to capsid misassembly or antigen misfolding, hindering generation of protective immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we establish a platform for irreversibly decorating VLPs simply by mixing with protein antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SpyCatcher is a genetically-encoded protein designed to spontaneously form a covalent bond to its peptide-partner SpyTag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expressed in E. coli VLPs from the bacteriophage AP205 genetically fused to SpyCatcher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated quantitative covalent coupling to SpyCatcher-VLPs after mixing with SpyTag-linked to malaria antigens, including CIDR and Pfs25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we showed coupling to the VLPs for peptides relevant to cancer from epidermal growth factor receptor and telomerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injecting SpyCatcher-VLPs decorated with a malarial antigen efficiently induced antibody responses after only a single immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This simple, efficient and modular decoration of nanoparticles should accelerate vaccine development, as well as other applications of nanoparticle devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Virus-like particles (VLPs) are self-assembling multi-protein particles that mimic the structural organization and conformation of viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VLPs enable both surface display as well as payload encapsulation, providing versatility as biomedical research tools and vaccines1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vaccines are one of the most effective of all medical interventions but for many diseases, such as malaria, HIV and cancer, vaccination has still had limited success2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, a rapid cycle of development, testing and production of new vaccines is required to deal with emerging pandemic viral threats4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Display on VLPs greatly enhances the response to otherwise poorly immunogenic epitopes5,6, because of a number of key characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dense protein arrangement of VLPs strongly triggers B-cell receptor clustering6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 20200nm size of VLPs facilitates direct drainage to lymph nodes, increasing uptake by antigen-presenting cells and cross-presentation6,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the RNA or DNA packaged in VLPs triggers costimulatory signals through Toll-like receptors TLR3/7/8/97,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VLPs can be conveniently produced at high quantities and commercial scale through heterologous recombinant gene expression in a range of expression systems, including Escherichia coli, tobacco and yeast species9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VLPs are in use or under development to vaccinate against bacterial, viral and protozoal pathogens3,10,11, as well as against chronic diseases (autoimmunity, allergy, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer)12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Display of antigens on VLPs is usually achieved by either chemical conjugation or genetic fusion to the viral coat protein1,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic fusion has been successful in numerous examples but remains a time-consuming trial-and-error approach16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic fusion of certain antigens leads to misfolding of the antigen or the capsid; this misfolding either impairs VLP assembly or stability, or leads to the display of antigen in a non-native conformation, so that the antibodies raised are ineffective15,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another major challenge with genetic fusion is that the host optimal for VLP expression and the host optimal for antigen expression (bacterium, yeast, mammalian cell-line, or plant) may have different post-translational modifications (particularly disulfide bond formation and glycosylation)15,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Therefore, separately expressing the VLP and target antigen is often preferable or necessary; subsequently the VLP and target antigen must be linked together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conjugation through the abundant amino groups (Lys, N-terminus) or carboxyl groups (Asp, Glu, C-terminus) gives a heterogeneous mixture, so conjugation through an exposed sulfhydryl group (Cys) on the antigen is the most common route19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical conjugation may give limited control over the number of VLP modifications, leading to heterogeneous and incomplete VLP coverage with antigen18,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, many surface-exposed antigens of pathogenic or human origin contain disulfide bonds, which play an important role in protein folding and stabilization, so a new cysteine can be disruptive22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alternative routes to VLP functionalization include non-covalent VLP:antigen linkage, such as attaching Ni-NTA to VLPs for linkage of His-tagged antigens24 but the stability during storage and in the body may be an issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins can be expressed in one cell-type and then transferred into VLPs, although this is restricted to VLPs containing a lipid bilayer and the purification of the GPI-linked proteins is non-trivial14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unnatural amino acids may be incorporated into the VLP and antigen for click chemistry conjugation25,26,27, enabling site-specific modification and stable linkage, but the increased complexity of protein expression, side-reactions of certain azide/alkyne/tetrazine groups28,29,30 and the increased frequency of misreading of unnatural amino acid codons31 mean that there is still a need for simple and scalable approaches for covalent VLP:antigen linkage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address this challenge, we made use of genetically-encoded spontaneous amide bond formation32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SpyTag is a peptide we previously engineered to form a spontaneous and irreversible isopeptide bond to its protein partner SpyCatcher simply upon mixing (Fig 1)33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both SpyTag and SpyCatcher can be positioned at various locations in protein chains, are reactive under a wide range of conditions (pH, buffer, temperature), and do not possess cysteines33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we establish the use of SpyTag-SpyCatcher reactivity for modular VLP functionalization, characterizing SpyCatcher-linked VLPs, demonstrating conjugation to a range of different antigens, and showing effective immunization in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SpyCatcher-VLP_expression_and_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We genetically fused SpyCatcher to the N-terminus of the viral coat protein (CP3) of the RNA bacteriophage AP205 (Fig 1)36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SpyCatcher-CP3 was expressed in E. coli and VLPs were purified to homogeneity from cell-lysate by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and then by dialysis using a 300 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Size-exclusion chromatography showed the material eluting in the MDa range expected for VLPs, with concurrent elution of protein (280nm absorbance) and nucleic acid species (260nm absorbance), typical for AP205 VLPs (Fig 2a)36,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative-staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of particles consistent with VLPs (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantifying the particle size from TEM gave a diameter of 20±3.2nm (mean±1 s.d., n=100) (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SpyCatcher-VLP_covalent_conjugation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For initial validation of SpyCatcher-VLP reactivity, we mixed the VLPs with the model SpyTag-linked protein, E. coli maltose binding-protein (MBP)33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SpyCatcher-CP3 gave a clean band on SDS-PAGE and after mixing with excess SpyTag-MBP, all the SpyCatcher-CP3 moved to a higher molecular weight, consistent with quantitative covalent bond formation (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The negative control SpyTag DA-MBP, with the reactive aspartic acid of SpyTag changed to alanine33, did not change SpyCatcher-CP3 mobility (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then tested SpyCatcher-VLP decoration with immunologically-relevant antigens from Plasmodium falciparum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) contains a Complex lysine and cysteine-rich Inter-Domain Region (CIDR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CIDR interaction with endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) is associated with severe childhood malaria, through the trapping of parasite-infected red blood cells in the brain microvasculature40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HB3var03 and IT4var07 represent two distinct versions of the CIDR domain from different natural isolates, with similar structures but substantial sequence divergence40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SpyTag was genetically fused to the N-terminus of each CIDR antigen, expressed and purified from E. coli, and incubated with SpyCatcher-VLPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete reaction was seen to SpyTag-CIDR(IT4var07) (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pfs25 is a P. falciparum sexual-stage antigen displayed on the surface of the parasite at the zygote and ookinete stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pfs25 is a leading malaria transmission-blocking candidate antigen: antibodies against Pfs25 completely prevent development of the parasite in the mosquito41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SpyTag was genetically fused to the C-terminus of Pfs25, before expression in mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SpyCatcher-VLPs also reacted covalently with Pfs25-SpyTag (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirmed that SpyCatcher-VLPs were efficient for conjugation to protein antigens linked to SpyTag at either terminus and expressed in bacteria or eukaryotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also tested conjugation of SpyCatcher-VLPs to solid-phase synthesized peptide antigens, in this case relevant to cancer immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Telo peptide is based on a human telomerase reverse transcriptase mutant epitope, tested for immunization against a range of cancers43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EGFRvIII peptide is derived from the cancer-specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) EGFRvIII mutant sequence, applied for immunization against human glioblastoma44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High yielding conjugation to SpyCatcher-VLPs was observed after incubating with SpyTag-Telo and EGFRvIII-SpyTag (Supplementary Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Native agarose gel electrophoresis was used to test that covalent reaction occurred while the coat protein was assembled in VLPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging of the gel showed co-migration of a distinct protein band and nucleic acid band, indicating encapsulation of nucleic acid by the hybrid SpyCatcher-VLPs (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AP205 VLPs have been previously shown to encapsulate various RNAs from their expression host39,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This SpyCatcher-VLP band was uniformly decreased in mobility by conjugation with SpyTag-CIDR(IT4var07) (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in subsequent experiments, excess antigen was simply removed from conjugated VLPs by dialysis using a high MWCO membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunization_using_SpyCatcher-VLPs_against_CIDR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having established the integrity and reactivity of the particles, we explored the efficiency of SpyCatcher-VLPs for generating an immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on the immune response to CIDR(IT4var07).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were immunized intramuscularly with 20g CIDR(IT4var07) equivalent, either as SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR conjugate, a negative control of SpyCatcher-VLPs+untagged CIDR, or a further negative control of CIDR alone (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reaction to form the SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR conjugate was validated by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig S2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All immunizations were performed in the absence of adjuvant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were boosted at day 14 with the same dosing regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibody titer against CIDR was measured 2 weeks after each immunization (on days 13 and 28) via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each time-point tested, SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR induced a higher anti-CIDR response than either SpyCatcher-VLPs+untagged CIDR or the CIDR-only group (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 13, only the SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR group showed anti-CIDR antibody generation, significantly better than with SpyCatcher-VLPs+untagged CIDR or the CIDR-only (in each case p=0.002, n=6, Mann-Whitney test) (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After boosting, an anti-CIDR antibody response was seen in 6 of 6 mice in the SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR group, but only in 2 of 6 mice with SpyCatcher-VLPs+untagged CIDR and 4 of 6 mice with CIDR-only, indicating that, as expected, on its own CIDR is a poor immunogen (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anti-CIDR response at day 28 for the SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR group was significantly higher than the responses of the SpyCatcher-VLPs+untagged CIDR group or the CIDR-only group (in each case p=0.002, n=6, Mann-Whitney test) (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of unconjugated SpyCatcher-VLPs did not affect the immune response to CIDR (day 28 p=0.3, not significant, n=6, Mann-Whitney test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure the immune response against the SpyCatcher-VLP platform, rather than the antigen target, we coated ELISA plates with SpyCatcher-VLPs and determined the antibody titer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, mice in the SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR and SpyCatcher-VLPs+untagged CIDR groups generated an immune response to SpyCatcher-VLPs (Supplementary Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this response to SpyCatcher-VLPs at day 13 was significantly lower in the SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR group than the SpyCatcher-VLPs+untagged CIDR group (p=0.002, n=6, Mann-Whitney test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boosting with either conjugated or unconjugated particles increased the antibody response to SpyCatcher-VLPs by approximately 1 log, but again the response in the SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR group was significantly lower than the SpyCatcher-VLPs+untagged CIDR group (p=0.002, n=6, Mann-Whitney test) (Supplementary Fig S3), consistent with masking of the SpyCatcher-VLP surface by the covalently conjugated CIDR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunization_using_SpyCatcher-VLPs_against_Pfs25  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To support further the applicability of the SpyCatcher-VLP platform, we performed immunization against Pfs25, a promising transmission-blocking antigen41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We immunized mice intramuscularly with doses matched to 2.5 g of each version of Pfs25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunizing with Pfs25 and Pfs25-SpyTag was to test whether SpyTag itself somehow enhanced the immunogenicity of a linked antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two proteins were then also injected with SpyCatcher-VLPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reaction of SpyCatcher-VLP with Pfs25-SpyTag for immunization was validated by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig S2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested how adjuvant affected the antibody response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AddaVax, a squalene-based oil-in-water nanoemulsion, is a potent adjuvant, reported to promote a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response and based on the MF59 adjuvant licensed for use in an influenza vaccine46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were boosted at day 17 with the same dosing regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibody titer against Pfs25 was measured on days 16 and 34 via ELISA (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pfs25 and Pfs25-SpyTag proteins alone did not give a response, even after boosting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pfs25 with AddaVax gave a response only after boosting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SpyCatcher-VLPs conjugated to Pfs25-SpyTag gave a strong response even before boosting, whereas the negative control of SpyCatcher-VLPs+untagged Pfs25 gave significantly less response at day 16 or 34 (in each case p=0.002, n=6, Mann-Whitney test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including adjuvant gave a small increase to the SpyCatcher-VLPs:Pfs25-SpyTag response after the prime (p=0.002, n=6, Mann-Whitney test) and after the boost (p=0.04, n=6, Mann-Whitney test) (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with adjuvant, the response to Pfs25 protein did not match the response to SpyCatcher-VLPs:Pfs25-SpyTag (for day 16 or 34, p=0.002, n=6, Mann-Whitney test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test further whether the antibodies raised from the SpyCatcher-VLP immunization could recognize native antigen, we stained a blood smear containing ookinetes expressing Pfs25 on their surface and detected the antibody staining by fluorescence microscopy (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serum from mice boosted with SpyCatcher-VLPs:Pfs25-SpyTag and AddaVax gave strong antibody labeling on the surface of the ookinete, similar to the pattern with the validated anti-Pfs25 monoclonal antibody 4B7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a negative control, serum from a mouse immunized with the control antigen ovalbumin and AddaVax gave minimal surface staining (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have established a platform for simple, rapid and stable linking of antigens to virus-like particles for immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated VLP decoration with a range of malarial protein antigens and cancer-related peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the tolerance for SpyTag/SpyCatcher fusion shown by ourselves and other laboratories for applications with dendritic cell-targeting antibodies47, membrane protein imaging48, biofilms49,50 and hydrogels51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SpyCatcher-VLPs could be simply expressed from E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For isolated Pfs25 protein, we required adjuvant and boosting to obtain a robust antibody response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SpyCatcher-VLPs decorated with the CIDR or Pfs25 antigens generated a robust antibody response after only a single immunization without requiring adjuvant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In future work it will be interesting to explore the use of SpyCatcher-SpyTag ligation for decoration of other vaccine-relevant platforms, such as norovirus and Hepatitis B virus3,24,52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recently approved malaria vaccine still has only modest efficacy54 so further malaria vaccine engineering is clearly needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be useful to test how the immune response from the SpyCatcher-VLP platform relates to disease protection in animal challenge models, including with promising malarial transmission-blocking antigens like Pfs2541,55 or blood-stage antigens like RH552,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SpyCatcher is derived from Streptococcus pyogenes and the coat protein is from a bacteriophage, so antibodies were raised as expected to the SpyCatcher-VLP platform, although coupling the antigen reduced this immunogenicity47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most VLPs are immunogenic, so this is not a new issue; indeed VLP carriers can be used for repeated booster immunizations and existing antibody responses against the vaccine may even benefit vaccine immunogenicity at the time of boosting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RTS,S malaria vaccine, based on the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) backbone, has been given successfully three times with a booster immunization at 20 months whilst also inducing anti-HBsAg antibody responses57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to live viral vaccine vectors which require in situ antigen expression following infection of immunized cells; in this case anti-vector immunity impedes subsequent vector administration, meaning that different immunization platforms/vectors are required for prime versus boost3,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with antibodies to SpyCatcher-VLPs present at day 13, we saw a second injection with conjugated SpyCatcher-VLPs still boosted the response to the target CIDR antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tag/Catcher principle of covalent peptide reaction has been established for a number of different pairs and so it may be possible to use these other pairs in future rounds of immunization58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from vaccination, it will also be valuable to explore the use of Plug-and-Display nanoparticle decoration in other applications, such as drug delivery, enzyme scaffolds, biosensors, and cancer immunotherapy1,60,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

C41 E. coli67, a kind gift of Anthony Watts (University of Oxford), was transformed with pGEM-SpyCatcher-AP205cp3 and pFH255 and plated on LB-Lennox (5g/L NaCl) agar plates with 100g/mL ampicillin and 34g/mL chloramphenicol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plates were incubated at 37°C for 1620h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 entire colonies were picked into 400mL LB-Lennox medium with 20g/mL ampicillin and 34g/mL chloramphenicol in a 2 L strongly-baffled glass flask and incubated without shaking for 1014h at 37°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The culture was then diluted 1:1 with fresh media (final concentration 20g/mL ampicillin, 17g/mL chloramphenicol assuming that all previous ampicillin was degraded overnight) and incubated with shaking at 120rpm (Infors Multitron, 2.5cm throw) at 37°C for 1h, before induction at A600 0.9 with 1 mM IPTG for 68h at 37°C, shaking at 180rpm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Purification_of_VLPs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One 1,000mL culture-derived pellet (typically 12 in total) was washed in 50mL ice-cooled PBS and spun for 10min at 4,000g at 4°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellet was resuspended at RT in 10mL lysis buffer: 20mM TrisHCl, 150mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resuspended mixture was incubated at RT for 15min, placed in an ice-salt water bath for 10min and then sonicated 4 times for 30 s, with a minimum of 1min between each pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lysates were spun twice at 15,000g for 20min at 4°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was filtered using a 1.2m glass filter device (Sartorius) and then through a 0.45m surfactant-free cellulose acetate filter device (Nalgene).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  250 U benzonase (Sigma) was added and the mixture incubated for 5min at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ni-NTA elution buffer (50mM TrisHCl, 300mM NaCl, 1M imidazole, pH 7.8) was then added to a final concentration of 75mM imidazole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1mL of packed Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) was added to the cleared lysate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tubes were incubated on a rotary shaker for 10min at 4°C and then centrifuged for 2min at 4,700g, 4°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resin was washed three times in 100mM imidazole washing buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was then aspirated and the remaining resin was once more added to the cleared lysate imidazole-conditioned solution, the process repeated and finally resuspended in 15mL 100mM NTA-buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5mL each were transferred to a 15mL Falcon tube (3 in total) and each tube was topped up to 15mL with 100mM washing buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-114 (TX114), to remove endotoxin68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two more washes with full volume TX114, 100mM imidazole were applied, prior to three washes without TX114.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was resuspended and applied to a polyprep column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For elution, the polyprep column was capped, 2.5mL of elution buffer [2 M imidazole, 50mM glycine, 25mM sodium citrate, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 8.5] added and the resin incubated on a mini shaker (900rpm) for 10min at RT prior to elution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eluate was once more cleared over a mini polyprep column (Bio-Rad) to remove any agarose resin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow-through in 1.5mL centrifuge tubes was spun for 10min at 4°C at 17,000g, pipetted into a 300kDa MWCO cellulose ester dialysis tubing (SpectrumLabs) and dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 1,000-fold excess of 50mM glycine, 25mM sodium citrate, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 8.0 for buffer exchange and to deplete species such as VLP monomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dialysis was repeated in fresh buffer for an additional 3h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After dialysis, the sample was spun once more at 17,000g for 10min at 4°C, to remove any aggregate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
