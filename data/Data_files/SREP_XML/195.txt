High C3 photosynthetic capacity and high intrinsic water use efficiency underlies the high productivity of the bioenergy grass Arundo donax  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Arundo donax has attracted interest as a potential bioenergy crop due to a high apparent productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It uses C3 photosynthesis yet appears competitive with C4 grass biomass feedstocks and grows in warm conditions where C4 species might be expected to be that productive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this there has been no systematic study of leaf photosynthetic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study determines photosynthetic and photorespiratory parameters for leaves in a natural stand of A. donax growing in southern Portugal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesise that A. donax has a high photosynthetic potential in high and low light, stomatal limitation to be small and intrinsic water use efficiency unusually low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High photosynthetic rates in A. donax resulted from a high capacity for both maximum Rubisco (Vc,max 117mol CO2m2 s1) and ribulose-1:5-bisphosphate limited carboxylation rate (Jmax 213mol CO2m2 s1) under light-saturated conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximum quantum yield for light-limited CO2 assimilation was also high relative to other C3 species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photorespiratory losses were similar to other C3 species under the conditions of measurement (25%), while stomatal limitation was high (0.25) resulting in a high intrinsic water use efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall the photosynthetic capacity of A. donax is high compared to other C3 species, and comparable to C4 bioenergy grasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) has attracted interest as a potential bioenergy crop, due to a high apparent productivity and suitability as an accepted feedstock for cellulosic fuel production1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is found throughout the Mediterranean climate zones of the world and has been cultivated in Asia, southern Europe and North Africa for over a thousand years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a rhizomatous perennial herbaceous grass that produces stems of ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23cm diameter that may grow to heights of 36m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is found in moist grasslands and wetlands although it is able to thrive across a wide range of soil types, while also being tolerant of mild drought and salinity, and is tolerant of water-logged soils2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In climates with warm winters it is evergreen but dies back in climates with freezing winter temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are related species within the genus, molecular analysis suggests that A. donax is monophyletic in origin and its spread has not involved hybridisation with the related species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses also suggest that it originated in west Asia and then spread to the Mediterranean region5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high productivity of A. donax is achieved in warm growing conditions despite the fact that it uses C3 photosynthesis, which might be expected to be a competitive disadvantage compared to C4 species under such growing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Side-by-side trials in central Italy over 11 years showed an average yield of above-ground dry biomass of 28.7 t ha1 yr1 for the highly productive C4 perennial grass Miscanthus x giganteus Deu et Greef, but 37.7 t ha1 yr1 for A. donax6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this appears a relatively low yield for M. x giganteus under irrigated conditions in the Mediterranean7, the reported yield for A. donax is high by any measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A. donax in central and southern Italy showed average dry matter yield over 3 years of up to 74 t ha1 yr1, which exceeds the highest yields reported for M. x giganteus8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in a multi-year study in Alabama A. donax achieved an average yield of 35.5 t ha1 yr1 compared to 23.5 t ha1 yr1 for switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.)9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a comparison with C4 sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) in northern Italy, light penetration into an A. donax canopy studied over a three year period was found to be 60% higher and the efficiency of conversion of intercepted radiation into biomass was ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  60% higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be explained by its more effective distribution of light through the canopy, if it is coupled with a similar efficiency of leaf photosynthesis10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, yields may be considerably lower on marginal land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a sandy loam with limited nutrient availability A. donax required three years to accumulate 20 t ha1, and build a rhizome mass of 16 t ha1 4, by contrast to M. x giganteus which has proved significantly more productive on marginal sites12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While M. x giganteus was found particularly vulnerable to damage by water-logging of soils during autumn and winter, A. donax appeared to thrive in these situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tolerance of water-logging also allows A. donax to spread along watercourses from rhizome fragments where M. x giganteus cannot13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its ability to survive anaerobic soil may explain its ability to tolerate high levels of reduced ions of heavy metals14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A. donax is clearly a resilient, but also very productive species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is little fundamental knowledge available on how it is able to realise this productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding this demands knowledge of leaf photosynthesis as well as canopy microclimate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Leaf photosynthetic rates of CO2 uptake (A) measured in A. donax growing on an estuary in S. Africa were between 20 and 37mol m2 s1 15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining modulated chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange, photorespiration was estimated to decrease A by 30%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although water potential declined to 2.1MPa around noon on sunny days, stomatal conductance (gs) and A changed little.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such low leaf water potential would normally be expected to at least cause partial stomatal closure in most species15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rates of stomatal conductance reported are at the upper end of those found in other C3 species but not much greater than those of the productive C4 bioenergy grasses M. x giganteus and P. virgatum, as well as productive modern cultivars of maize (Zea mays L.)16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, A. donax achieves and exceeds the productivities normally associated with C4 perennial grasses in warm climates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a plant which forms a high leaf area index (LAI) monocultures in nature and as a crop, it would be expected to have a high photosynthetic capacity at both high and low light intensity under warm conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high photosynthetic capacity is needed in the context of a dense canopy where shaded leaves need to achieve high efficiency, as well as those in full sun, and where all leaves need to be efficient under the low light conditions of dawn, dusk and cloudy days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet it is a C3 species, growing in warm conditions where only a C4 species might be expected to be photosynthetically efficient18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limited published data suggests that A. donax may indeed have high light-saturated leaf photosynthetic rates, which may also be supported by high leaf conductances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High leaf conductances will allow a higher CO2 concentration at ribulose-1:5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), so increasing the rate of carboxylation and decreasing photorespiration, but at the expense of water loss and water use efficiency19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better define the photosynthetic capacity of A. donax and understand how this may explain its high productivity this study aimed to define key in vivo properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were: Jmax, the maximum whole chain electron transport rate supporting ribulose-1:5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration, Vc,max the maximum rate of carboxylation that can be supported by Rubisco, the light-saturated rate of CO2 assimilation (Asat) and the maximum quantum yield of CO2 assimilation (CO2,max) defined by the initial slope of the response of A to absorbed photon flux (I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concurrent measurement of water vapour flux and modulated chlorophyll fluorescence were used to determine gs, stomatal limitation to CO2 uptake (l), intercellular CO2 concentration (ci), and the whole chain electron transport rate (J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parameters were determined for leaves in a natural stand of A. donax growing in a dry valley in S. Portugal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are used to test the hypotheses that A. donax has a high photosynthetic potential in both high and low light, that stomatal limitation may be unusually small and thus intrinsic leaf water use efficiency poor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in vivo measures: Jmax, Vc,max, Asat and CO2,max, are key to parameterization of the steady-state biochemical model of C3 photosynthesis20 which underlies most models of crop and ecosystem productivity21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study therefore also serves as a key resource for parameterizing production models of this emerging crop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Field_location  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study was undertaken on a naturally occurring A. donax stand located at Quinta de São Pedro - Centro de estudos (Armadas, 2815786 Sobreda, Portugal 38°3840.6N 9°1134.5W, altitude 85m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mixed 5 acre site with a disturbed dry valley community of annuals, patches of native macchia and scrub, pine woodland, introduced Acacia woodland and a few planted ornamentals on a Cambisol soils22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Meteorological_assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Relative humidity, air temperature and irradiance were measured over the sampling period using a Weather Station (WS-GP2 with GP2 Data Logger, Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative Humidity and air temperature were used to calculate vapour pressure deficit (VPD), as a virtual channel within the GP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil temperature and soil water content were measured within the stand over the sampling period using soil moisture sensors (SM300 with GP2 Data Logger, Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stomatal_Conductance_and_In_situ_Chlorophyll_Fluorescence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measurements of stomatal conductance were made with a diffusion porometer (AP4, Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All measurements of conductance and photosynthesis were made on the most recently expanded leaf, as judged by ligule emergences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Readings were taken on several leaves, locating the porometer at three points along each leaf: 1) the base just above the ligule, 2) the midpoint between ligule to tip; and 3) the area just below the leaf tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the adaxial and abaxial surfaces were measured at these points at midday and mid-afternoon following the procedures of Monteith23, and Potter24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modulated chlorophyll fluorescence was monitored to estimate the operating efficiency of PSII (Fq/Fm)25,26 on fully emerged leaves at midday and late afternoon using a fluorometer (MONITORING-PAM, Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Photosynthetic_intercellular-CO2_response_curves  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Leaves were sampled pre-dawn from the A. donax stand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leaves were excised just above the ligule, and immediately re-cut under water and then kept in cool low-light conditions (20°C and 20mol m2 s2) until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response of net leaf CO2 uptake rate (A) to external CO2 concentration (ca) was assessed on five different leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leaves were placed in the leaf cuvette of a portable open gas exchange system (LCPro-SD with 6.25cm2 cuvette; ADC BioScientific Ltd. Herts, England; or LI6400XT with 6cm2 cuvette; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Air temperature was controlled at 25oC, leaf temperature 27oC and VPD at 0.96kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To fully induce photosynthesis before measurements commenced, leaves were first allowed to equilibrate at a photon flux (I) of 500 mol m2 s1 and reference ca of 400mol mol1 until A had reached a stable value, the I was then increase to 1500 mol m2 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When A had reached a stable value at I=1500mol m2 s1 ca was then changed to the following levels in sequence, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 50, 400, 600, 900, 1200 and 1500mol mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leaf remained at each level until a stable A could be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potential Rubisco carboxylation (Vc,max) and electron transport through photosystem II (Jmax) were determined from the responses of Asat to ci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each leaf values of A located above the transition between Rubisco-limited and RuBP- or electron transport-limited photosynthesis in the A/ci response were used to solve for Jmax using the equations representing RuBP regeneration-limited A20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values were temperature adjusted to 25oC using the temperature response equations of Bernacchi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2001)27 for the Rubisco-limited, and Bernacchi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2003)28 for the RuBP regeneration limited portions of the A vs ci curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stomatal limitation (l) at the current ambient ca of 400mol mol1 was derived using the method outlined in Long and Bernacchi (2003)29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Photosynthetic_light_response_curves  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sampling and measurements of A vs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I were performed in parallel with A vs. ci curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leaves were placed in the leaf cuvette of an integrated open gas exchange system and modulated chlorophyll fluorometer (GFS-3000FL, LED-Array/PAM-Fluorometer 3055-FL and 3080-O2 Oxygen sensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leaves were adapted to an incident photon flux of 1500mol m2 s1 prior to measurements with the [CO2] at 400 mol mol1 and leaf temperature controlled at 25oC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VPD of the air entering the gas exchange system was maintained between 0.8 and 1.1kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photosynthetic light response curves were then obtained at ambient (21%) and low (2%) oxygen concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photon flux was varied in a step-wise manner, either starting from the photon flux at which photosynthesis had been induced, after a steady-state A was obtained or alternating between different photon fluxes, in each case waiting for a steady-state to be obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photon flux levels were 2000, 1500, 1000, 700, 500, 350, 250, 150, 75, 45mol m2 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each light level, once a new steady state was reached gas exchange rates were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneously, Fq/Fm was determined via modulated chlorophyll fluorescence and application of a saturating flash as previously described25,26,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The light response of CO2 assimilation rate is described by a four-parameter non-rectangular hyperbola, according to Marshall and Biscoe31:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where A is the CO2 assimilation rate (mol m2 s1), max is the apparent maximum quantum yield (mol CO2 (mol photons)1), I is the incident photon flux (mol m2 s1), Asat is the CO2 assimilation rate at saturating photon flux (mol m2 s1),  is the curve convexity (dimensionless) and Rd is mitochondrial respiration in the light (mol m2 s1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light compensation point (LCP) was determined as the incident photon flux (I) where A=0 as predicted from the fitted curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The quantum yield of CO2 assimilation, CO2, was determined according to Genty30:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where A is corrected for respiratory loss (Rd) and divided by the absorbed photon flux (I), with  as the leaf absorbance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method used to determine absorbance under the chamber lighting conditions is described later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The parameters CO2 and Fq/Fm have been shown to be linearly related under conditions where photorespiration is suppressed30,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under ambient (21%) and low (2%) oxygen atmosphere, the relationship can be used to assess the possible operation of electron acceptors other than CO2, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  photorespiration or active oxygen production, which are manifest as an increased Fq/Fm relative to its corresponding CO234.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relation of the quantum yield of CO2 assimilation (CO2) after Valentini35 to the operating efficiency of PSII (Fq/Fm) under non-photorespiratory conditions can be described as a linear relationship30, where b is the y axis intercept and k is the slope of the relationship between Fq/Fm and CO2:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assuming 4 electrons are necessary for the fixation of a CO2 molecule, this can be expressed as:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where e is the quantum yield of total electron flow, which can be rewritten as:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This relationship is assumed to hold in the presence and in the absence of photorespiration, where in the presence of photorespiration it can be used to calculate the total electron flow, which is the sum of electron flow to the reactions of carboxylation (JC) and oxygenation (JO)35:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
JC can be calculated by assuming 4 electrons are needed per CO2 for carboxylation:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Rp is the amount of CO2 released by photorespiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JO can be calculated by assuming that 8 electrons are needed per CO2 released in photorespiration:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combining the equations for JT, JC and JO then gives:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Leaf_transmission_and_reflectance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immediately following completion of the gas exchange measurements leaf absorbance () was measured from 400 to 700nm, with a dual-channel spectrometer and integrating spheres (SpectroClip-JAZ-TR, Ocean Optics, Oxford, UK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six spectral measurements of leaf transmittance and reflectance were made per leaf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average transmittance () and reflectance (R) for each leaf was used to determine =(1R).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total absorbance for the PAR spectrum was calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total absorbed light was also calculated by combining the percentage of actinic light emitted by the blue (470nm) and red (640nm) LEDs in the leaf gas exchange chamber with  for the peak wavelength of the two LED types36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent maximum quantum yield (max) was then recalculated to give the maximum absolute quantum yield, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the net number of CO2 molecules absorbed by the leaf per photon absorbed:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intrinsic_leaf_water_use_efficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intrinsic leaf water use efficiency (LWUE) was calculated from gas exchange of CO2 and H2O as the ratio of CO2 assimilation (A) over stomatal conductance (gs) under 21% O2 at photon fluxes of 1000 and 2000mol m2 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to the water use efficiency calculated from A over transpiration (E)37, A/gs is considered to be more realistic and comparable between studies, as it is not influenced by changes in leaf to air VPD in the leaf chamber38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The light response of A. donax for A at high and low O2 showed an increase of A when O2 was lowered, compared to that at 21% O2, indicating the reduction of A in air due to photorespiration (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At both O2 concentrations, A did not reach a plateau, even at high photon flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the light response of gs and ci were lowered when O2 concentration was reduced (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response of gs to light largely scaled with A, while ci reached a plateau above a photon flux of 600mol m2 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the response of A to light, parameters were derived (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CO2 assimilation rate at saturating photon flux (Asat) was remarkably high at both ambient (30.19+/0.32mol m2 s1) and low O2 concentration (34.86+/1.2mol m2 s1) whereas the predicted values of A at infinite photon flux density as described by the fitted hyperbola were 38.11+/0.56mol m2 s1 at ambient O2 and 43.45+/2.08mol m2 s1 at low O2 concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum quantum yield of CO2 assimilation (CO2,max) at ambient and low O2 level was found to be 0.056 (+/0.0029) and 0.072 (+/0.0045) respectively, mol CO2 (mol absorbed photons)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intrinsic leaf water use efficiency (A/gs) (LWUE) was 62.9 (+/2.38) mol mol1 at sub-saturating photon flux (1000mol m2 s1) and 66.0 (+/1.97) mol mol1 at near-saturating photon flux (2000mol m2 s1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under 21% O2, the electron flow to oxygenation reactions of Rubisco (JO) and the rate of CO2 production by photorespiration (Rp) increased with photon flux, until a plateau was reached at a photon flux of 1000mol m2 s1 (Fig 2.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the electron flow to carboxylation (JC) increased further with increasing photon flux and did not appear to reach a plateau (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was estimated that ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25% of electron flow is accounted for by JO under saturating light intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of CO2 production by photorespiration, Rp, to assimilation (Asat) was 0.216.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total leaf absorbance from 400nm to 700nm was 0.87 (+/ 4.0×103, n=6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total leaf absorbance at the peak emitting wavelengths of red (640nm) and blue (470nm) was 0.89 (S.E.+/4.47×103, n=6) and used to calculate Fq/Fm against the quantum yield of CO2 assimilation (CO2) on an absorbed light basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relation between Fq/Fm and CO2 under high and low O2 showed significant positive correlations (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in slope of the relation, representing the apparent electron demand to assimilate one CO2, at ambient and low O2 concentration can be attributed to the presence or absence of photorespiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The response of A to ci for A. donax leaves at saturating light intensity was determined at ambient O2 concentration (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, parameters were derived to describe the A/ci response and the stomatal limitation (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum velocity of carboxylation by Rubisco (Vc,max), was 117.8mol m2 s1 and the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax) was 213.7mol m2 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CO2 compensation point, , was 44.2 mol mol1 and the limitation to A imposed by stomata and leaf boundary layer, l, was 0.25 (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Soil water content between 20cm and 40cm soil depth averaged 0.14m3 m3 (+/ 0.01) across the sampling area over the sampling period, with an average soil temperature of 21oC (+/ 0.9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stomatal conductance of A. donax, measured on ad- and abaxial surfaces of leaves on three different positions along the leaf blade, were highest at noon (12:00) and declined in the afternoon (16:00, Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest stomatal conductance was observed in the middle of the leaf at both time points and both surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greatest decline in stomatal conductance between noon and afternoon was observed in the middle of the leaf, on both adaxial and abaxial surfaces (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though there was a great decline in stomatal conductance, the operating efficiency of PSII (Fq/Fm) at noon and in the afternoon in the field did not decrease as much (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that stomatal conductance was still not greatly limiting for photosynthesis during the afternoon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Light-saturated capacity for photosynthetic CO2 uptake is determined by the maximum rate of carboxylation (Vc,max) and the maximum rate of electron transport, (Jmax), depending on the inter-cellular CO2 concentration (ci)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Averaged across 109 C3 species, Vc,max was 64mol m2 s1 and Jmax 134mol m2 s1 39, this compares to values found here for A. donax of 117.8 and 213.7mol CO2 m2 s1, respectively, which are almost double the C3 average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are for a natural and unfertilized stand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically in C3 crops these values will increase with nitrogen status40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the values found here for A. donax are high even compared to fertilized or N-fixing productive crops: Phalaris arundinacae (83.9 and 150.6mol m2 s1)41, Triticum aestivum (59 and 139mol m2 s1)40, Oryza sativa (91 and 190mol m2 s1 42, Helianthus annuus (29 and Heinz walz mol m2 s1)43, Glycine max (83 and 160mol m2 s1)44, and Phaseolus vulgaris (88 and 178mol m2 s1)45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the high light-saturated maximum photosynthetic capacity of A. donax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to other tall grass species considered as bioenergy sources, A. donax shows high A in full sunlight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1 shows an average A of 30.2mol m2 s1 at 25°C, this compares to values at this temperature of 28mol m2 s1 for M. x giganteus46, 24mol m2 s1 in field grown stands of Panicum virgatum (switchgrass)16, and 22mol m2 s1 for the C3 bioenergy grass, Phalaris arundinacea (Reed canary grass)47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Is this A achieved by lower losses to photorespiration in A. donax?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we assume average Rubisco kinetic properties as described by Brooks and Farquhar48 for spinach, then the CO2 photosynthetic compensation point (*) would be 42.5mol mol1 at 25°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this value, with the measured dark respiratory rate (Rd) of 2 mol m2 s1, average A of 30.19mol m2 s1 and ci of 255mol m2 s1 at a photon flux of 2000mol m2 s1 (Fig 1), the photorespiratory rate of CO2 release (Rp) would be 6.3mol m2 s1, following the equations of Farquhar et al.20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This calculated rate, based on properties of spinach, is very close to the rate derived here for A. donax by combining fluorescence and gas exchange measurements (Fig 2) via the equations of Valentini et al.35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that as a proportion of net photosynthesis, photorespiratory loss of carbon is just as great in A. donax as in other C3 species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Is the rate of CO2 assimilation in limiting light high in A. donax?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light limited photosynthesis is determined by the efficiency with which the leaf can absorb incident light (), and the maximum absolute quantum yield of CO2 assimilation (CO2,max), i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the initial slope of the response of A to I, corrected for absorptance ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value is therefore the maximum ratio of net absorbed CO2 molecules to absorbed photons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CO2,max determined for A. donax here in normal air at 25°C was 0.056mol mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Osborne and Garrett49 similarly measured CO2,max by combining gas exchange and integrating sphere measurements across a range of C3 herbage grasses and cereals, covering different ploidy levels and cultivars in normal air and at 25°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They reported an average CO2,max of 0.051, with a range of 0.047 to 0.055 across these C3 grasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So this does place the values here for A. donax at the upper end of this range and 8% higher than the average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The realized efficiency of light limited photosynthesis will be the product of CO2,max and the absorptance of the leaf ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In surveying a wide range of healthy leaves of C3 species from tropical to polar habitats, Long et al.50, found an average  of 0.80, and a range across species from 0.65 to 0.90, similarly measured in an integrating sphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, the  for A. donax of 0.89 therefore appears at the upper end of this range and 14% higher above the average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The product of the indicated above average CO2,max and  therefore represents a 24% increase in CO2 uptake per unit incident light, under light-limiting conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Does A. donax achieve high photosynthetic rates by minimizing stomatal limitation?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stomatal limitation imposed on photosynthesis, l, for A. donax found in this study (0.25 or 25%) was higher than for other C3 plants, which varied from 0.137 to 0.21751,52,53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that A. donax does not achieve its high photosynthetic rates through a high stomatal conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed ci/ca at full sunlight (2000mol m2 s1) as a measure of the balance between stomatal conductance and assimilation was 0.64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is almost 11% less than the average ci/ca of 0.72 for a range of C3 species19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lower ci/ca requires a lower stomatal conductance relative to the photosynthetic rate, indicating a higher leaf level water use efficiency for a given leaf-air water vapour pressure deficit than the average for C3 species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, while stomatal conductance may appear high (Fig 1b), the low values of l and ci/ca in fact show that conductance is low relative to the high rates of leaf CO2 uptakes for a C3 plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless its high light-saturated and light-limited photosynthetic rates can still only be achieved at the expense of considerable transpiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively high stomatal conductance maintained into the late afternoon (Table 3) suggests that the plant may be able to tap deep water resources even in its native Mediterranean in the late summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LWUE of A. donax in this study (62.9 to 66.0mol mol1) was higher than generally found for herbaceous species (43mol mol1) and more similar to LWUE found for evergreen shrubs and deciduous trees (64 and 66mol mol1, respectively)55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the LWUE of A. donax was still much lower than for C4 species such as Miscanthus and switchgrass (115 and 107mol mol1)16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high productivity of A. donax does resemble and exceeds that of C4 plants, however its LWUE is much lower and clearly C3-like.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This supports the notion that, as discussed above, A. donax is able to achieve its high photosynthetic rates with substantial transpiration, but is still more efficient than most C3 species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is interesting when considering the diversity of habitat distribution that A. donax is found in, which ranges from very wet loam to relatively dry sandy soils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall this study has found that the photosynthetic capacity of A. donax in full sunlight is high compared to other C3 species, and comparable to C4 bioenergy grasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not the result of lower photorespiratory rates, but rather a high capacity for both RuBP-limited and RuBP-saturated photosynthesis, as evidenced by values of both Vc,max and Jmax that are near double the average for C3 species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High photosynthetic rates were not achieved through a high stomatal conductance, in fact stomatal limitation was found to be greater not less than in other C3 species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light-limited photosynthesis, which will determine carbon uptake during periods of low light flux, around dawn and dusk, and during heavy cloud, as well as in the lower canopy may be aided by relatively high maximum quantum yields of CO2 assimilation and high leaf absorptances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
