High-throughput analysis of the satellitome illuminates satellite DNA evolution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Satellite DNA (satDNA) is a major component yet the great unknown of eukaryote genomes and clearly underrepresented in genome sequencing projects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show the high-throughput analysis of satellite DNA content in the migratory locust by means of the bioinformatic analysis of Illumina reads with the RepeatExplorer and RepeatMasker programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unveiled 62 satDNA families and we propose the term satellitome for the whole collection of different satDNA families in a genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that satDNAs were present in many contigs of the migratory locust draft genome indicates that they show many genomic locations invisible by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cytological pattern of five satellites showing common descent (belonging to the SF3 superfamily) suggests that non-clustered satDNAs can become into clustered through local amplification at any of the many genomic loci resulting from previous dissemination of short satDNA arrays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that all kinds of satDNA (micro- mini- and satellites) can show the non-clustered and clustered states suggests that all these elements are mostly similar, except for repeat length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the presence of VNTRs in bacteria, showing similar properties to non-clustered satDNAs in eukaryotes, suggests that this kind of tandem repeats show common properties in all living beings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eukaryote genomes are plenty of repetitive elements including transposable elements (TEs), tandem repeats, segmental duplications, ribosomal DNA, multi-copy gene families, pseudogenes, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  which, collectively, constitute the repeatome1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite DNA consists of a single sequence tandemly repeated many times, in contrast to tandemly repeated genes (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ribosomal RNA and histone genes) where the repeating unit consists of several different DNA sequences (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  genes and spacers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite DNA has been classified into microsatellites, minisatellites and satellites, with no complete consensus about the precise length limits2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although satellite DNA has traditionally been considered to be junk DNA, some possible functions have been suggested during last years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the most accepted functional roles for satDNA is its implication in centromeric function4, but other possible functional roles have also been suggested in relation with heterochromatin formation through the siRNA pathway5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The name satellite DNA is historical since this kind of repetitive DNA was discovered as a small peak in the CsCl ultracentrifugation profile7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Today this technique is not performed to search for satDNA, since it was replaced by other techniques such as DNA renaturation kinetics8, restriction digestion and electrophoresis yielding a ladder pattern9 and, most recently, by the bioinformatic analysis of a huge collection of short DNA sequences yielded by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anyway, the term satellite DNA is still useful because it is simple, descriptive and profusely used in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On this basis, we are proposing here the name satellitome for the whole collection of satDNAs in a genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recent publication of a draft genome of the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria) represents a milestone as it is the largest animal genome hitherto sequenced11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no doubt that it has provided excellent information for performing genomic work in other insects even though annotation is not complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as in other sequenced genomes, information about the repetitive components of the genome is rather scarce, especially for satDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have recently reported microsatellite content in L. migratoria at both genomic and cytogenetic levels12, but the search for satDNAs through the classical restriction endonuclease digestion and electrophoresis approach failed in this species (MD López-León and P Lorite, personal communication).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up to now, only 21 satDNAs have been reported in 12 orthopteran species, most of them grasshoppers (Supplementary Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, the use of NGS and new bioinformatic tools like RepeatExplorer10 has allowed the high-throughput detection of repetitive DNA, including satellite DNA, the most extreme case being the plant Luzula elegans with 37 satDNA families, 20 of which were analyzed by FISH13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we perform the high-throughput analysis of the satellitome from the information contained in Illumina reads obtained from two individuals of the migratory locust representing the Southern (SL) and Northern (NL) lineages (see methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By means of stepwise clustering of repetitive DNA10 intermingled by substraction of the repetitive elements found in previous steps, we found that the satellitome of L. migratoria consists of, at least, 62 different satDNAs with monomer size ranging between 5 and 400bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure allowed detection of many poorly abundant satDNAs which would have gone unnoticed through conventional methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical mapping of 59 of them by FISH showed three types of chromosome distribution, with clear predominance of chromosome-specific satDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, this broad catalog of different satDNA families allowed an analysis for general features which provided new insights on the origin and evolution of this part of the repeatome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-troughput_search_for_satDNAs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first run of RepeatExplorer (RE), performed in parallel on Illumina reads from the SL and NL individuals, we found 26 and 21 satDNAs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then selected all available reads of each lineage which, after DeconSeq filtering, lacked homology with all satDNAs and other RE clustered sequences previously found in both lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A new RE run detected 11 new satDNAs in SL and 9 in NL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a new step of filtering and RE analysis, we found 2 new satDNAs in SL and 5 in NL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the next filtering and RE step failed to show any new satDNA in both lineages, for which reason we stopped this iterative process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end, we found 39 satDNAs in the SL individual and 35 in the NL individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a whole, these analyses revealed the existence of 62 different satDNA families, 27 of which were assembled in SL, 23 in NL and 12 in both lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent analyses with RepeatMasker to score satDNA abundance and divergence, revealed that 59 out of the 62 satDNAs were present in both lineages, whereas two of them (LmiSat31-8 and LmiSat43231) were not found in the NL individual, and one (LmiSat62-23) was not found in the SL individual (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of variation within these 62 satDNA families showed the presence of 107 sequence variants (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17 per family) (Table 1, Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, all 62 satDNAs represent about 2.39% of the Southern genome and 2.74% of the Northern one (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This low amount of satDNA is consistent with the low amount of constitutive heterochromatin revealed by C-banding in this species14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high number of different satDNA families found in the genome of the migratory locust and the plant L. elegans13 indicates that eukaryote genomes usually contain a high diversity of satDNA families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During next years, huge amounts of new satDNAs are expected to be uncovered using NGS approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore suggest the following simple nomenclature rules to help managing this new information: satDNA name should begin with species abbreviation in Repbase (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lmi for Locusta migratoria) followed by the term Sat, a catalog number in order of decreasing abundance (according to the first genome analyzed), followed by consensus monomer length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the most abundant satDNA in the Spanish genome of L. migratoria would read LmiSat01193.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The catalog number would allow differentiating two satDNAs coinciding in length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, in the future, additional satDNA families were found in other populations of the same species, they should be numbered subsequently to the last one described in previous work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optionally, if a function is assigned to a satDNA, a reference to it could be added at the end of the name.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, since we know that LmiSat07-5 in L. migratoria is the telomeric DNA repeat15, we could name it LmiSat07-5-tel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SatDNA abundance was very similar in both genomes, but divergence showed a tendency to be higher in the Northern genome (Supplementary Results S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the reliability of the satDNAs found, we designed primers in opposite orientation for all of them and PCR amplified 59 of them on genomic DNA from Spanish specimens, belonging to the Southern lineage, collected at Cádiz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three exceptions (LmiSat46353, LmiSat52143 and LmiSat57230) were rare satDNAs which had been found by RepeatExplorer only in the NL genome, whereas RepeatMasker detected them also in the SL individual from the Padul population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, PCR failed to amplify them in four different SL individuals from the Cádiz population, suggesting population differences for the presence of these rare satDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, LmiSat07-5-tel corresponded with the telomeric DNA repeat (TTAGG)15, and was excluded from subsequent analyses because of its known function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we will work here with the remaining 58 satDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 58 satDNAs showed high variation for monomer length (8400bp) and A+T content (29.467.6%) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monomer length showed a bimodal distribution, with a 37bp gap (between 90 and 127bp) dividing the 58 satDNAs into two groups, one including 26 short satDNAs (890bp) and the other comprising 32 long satDNAs (127400bp).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 37bp gap in monomer length appears to be an oddity of the L. migratoria genome, as we have not found such a long gap in L. elegans or other grasshopper species (Ruiz-Ruano et al., unpublished).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long satDNAs showed higher A+T content and lower divergence than short ones, and the latter show a very high tendency to arise from G+C-rich genomic regions (Supplementary Results S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Short_and_long_satDNAs_show_similar_patterns_of_chromosomal_location  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed single FISH analysis for all 58 satDNAs and also double FISH combining a satDNA probe with rDNA or histone gene probes, when needed for accurate identification of the satDNA-carrying chromosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both short (Fig 1) and long (Fig 2) satDNAs showed three main patterns at cytological level: clustered at specific chromosome regions (c), non-clustered (nc) and a mixed pattern (m) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on satDNA abundance, the non-clustered pattern can go from complete absence of FISH signal to general chromosome brightness above background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixed pattern includes both large and very small clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequencies of c, nc and m patterns did not differ significantly between the two length classes (Supplementary Results S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a whole, the 47 clustered satDNAs (excluding telomeric DNA) showed 89 chromosomal clusters per haploid genome, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.89 per satDNA and 7.42 per chromosome pair, on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of them were proximal (52), whereas only 26 were interstitial and 11 distal, with a similar distribution between short and long satDNAs (Supplementary Results S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the exception of the telomeric repeat, short satDNAs were clustered on only 1 or 2 chromosome pairs, whereas clustered long satDNAs were found on 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 or all 12 chromosome pairs, the latter condition being found only for LmiSat01193, which was located proximal to the centromeric region in all chromosomes, with clusters in the eight shortest chromosome pairs (M4-S11) being larger than those in the four longer chromosomes (L1, L2, X and M3) (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most frequent pattern, in both short and long satDNAs, was the presence of a large cluster in a single chromosome pair, as was the case for 15 short and 18 long satDNAs (see Supplementary Table S3 and some examples in Figs 1b,d,e and 2e,f), with LmiSat2138 and LmiSat28263 showing two clusters in the same chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One satDNA (LmiSat23223) showed the same location as 45S rDNA in this species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ideogram in Fig 3 summarizes the location of all satDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Excluding the two only satDNAs which were present in all chromosomes, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LmiSat01193 and LmiSat07-5-tel, the remaining 46 families (19 short and 27 long) of clustered satDNAs (including those showing the mixed pattern) were irregularly distributed among the different chromosomes, with four chromosomes lacking short satDNAs (L1, X, M5 and M8) but all chromosomes carrying one or more different long satDNAs, in addition to LmiSat01193 (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the S9 chromosome was the only chromosome carrying more short (10) than long (6) satDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Only 14 satDNAs (4 short and 10 long) showed clusters in more than one chromosome pair, and this allows testing the equilocality of satDNA distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Supplementary Table S4 shows, short and long satDNAs displayed similar equilocality indices (0.63 and 0.65, respectively) thus reinforcing their similarities in chromosome distribution pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high number of different satDNAs described here is very useful for chromosome identification in L. migratoria, as 15 short and 18 long satDNAs were chromosome-specific markers allowing the direct identification of 9 out of the 12 chromosome pairs, the only exceptions being L1, M6 and S10 (Fig 3 and Supplementary Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these three chromosome pairs can indirectly be identified through their satDNA content pattern, since L1 is the only L-chromosome carrying LmiSat03195, LmiSat37238 and LmiSat45274, M6 is the only M-chromosome carrying LmiSat56-19 and 45S rDNA, and S10 can be identified because it lacks the chromosome-specific satDNAs present in the two similar-sized autosomes (S9 and S11) (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LmiSat0418, LmiSat05400 and LmiSat06185).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A search for the 62 satDNA sequences in the draft genome of L. migratoria11 revealed that most of them were present in a surprisingly high number of contigs, with very high differences among satDNA families (Table 1), this variation being positively correlated with abundance (Spearman rank correlation: rs=0.46, N=58, P=0.00026).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, clustered satDNAs showed no significant difference in the number of contigs compared with non-clustered ones (Mann-Whitney test: U=198, P=0.23), suggesting that both types of satDNAs are similarly scattered throughout the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in addition to the large arrays present in the clusters revealed by FISH, clustered satDNAs show many short arrays at many loci across the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Homologies_between_satDNAs_define_five_superfamilies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A comparison of DNA sequence between the 58 monomer families revealed the existence of similarity between some of them, which allowed defining five superfamilies (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig S3, superfamily 1 (SF1) includes two long satDNA families: LmiSat01193, located in pericentromeric regions of all chromosomes, and LmiSat13259 located only in the M4 chromosome, thus being a case of local derivation of LmiSat13259 from LmiSat01193.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SF2 includes LmiSat12273 and LmiSat16278 both distally located on the L2 chromosome, thus showing satDNA divergence without movement to non-homologous chromosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SF3 is composed of five different long satDNA families showing all patterns of chromosome location, thus illustrating how long satDNAs may evolve through sequence diversification and changes in chromosome location patterns (Table 1 and Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SF4 includes three long satDNA families (LmiSat26240, LmiSat37238 and LmiSat51241) interstitially located on different chromosomes (S11, L1 and L2, respectively), thus providing evidence for clustering on different non-homologous chromosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, SF5 included three short satDNAs (LmiSat31-8, LmiSat50-16 and LmiSat59-16) showing different location patterns, but the reliability of this superfamily is doubtful (see Supplementary Fig S4 and Supplementary Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Homology_with_other_repeated_sequences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found seven satDNA families with homology to sequences from Orthoptera contained in Repbase (Supplementary Table S6 and Supplementary Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LmiSat06185 showed homology with a satDNA previously described in the grasshopper Caledia captiva16, whereas the six remaining matches in Repbase were with transposable elements (TEs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LmiSat02176 showed homology with the 5-end of a Helitron lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two long satDNAs (LmiSat15190 and LmiSat34299) showed homology with the CDS of TEs type Gypsy and Polinton, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, LmiSat2968 andLmiSat5590 aligned with a region outside the CDS of two different hAT transposons, and LmiSat1989 with a DNA transposon described in L. migratoria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, LmiSat075-tel is the telomeric DNA repeat conserved in the majority of insects15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, LmiSat1137 showed high variation for the number of repeats of a GA microsatellite, for which reason this satDNA showed the highest divergence (56%) and number of variants (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other satDNA carrying microsatellites was found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that some satDNAs in L. migratoria originated from TEs, as in other organisms17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 62 satDNA families of L. migratoria reported here constitute the highest number of satDNA families ever found in a non-model species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The closest case was the 37 satDNAs reported in the plant Luzula elegans within a normal run of RepeatExplorer yielding 291 major repeat clusters with genome proportions of at least 0.01%13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the application of our filtering approach to the Illumina reads deposited by Heckman et al.13 in SRA uncovered 85 satDNA families (grouped into 5 superfamilies), with genome proportions of 0.00035% or higher (Supplementary Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that our approach improves significantly the bioinformatic analysis for satDNA characterization with RepeatExplorer, by being able to find satDNAs showing 28-fold lower abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By performing several successive filtering steps and searches with RepeatExplorer, in each step subtracting those repetitive elements found in previous steps, the chance of finding other poorly represented satDNAs is substantially increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In L. migratoria, the use of genomic reads from two distant populations has also been very useful, allowing detection of satDNAs with abundance as low as 0.00002%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anyway, it is still conceivable the existence of other less abundant satDNA families which have gone unnoticed with our methodology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, other individuals from the same or a different population could harbour other satDNA variants or families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high-throughput analysis of the satellitome in L. migratoria has unveiled several interesting properties of this kind of tandem repeats:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, the former considerations lead us to suggest a model for satellite DNA evolution (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first proposals about de novo formation of tandem repeats included the joint action of mutation and unequal crossing-over32, but other mechanisms, such as slippage replication and/or rolling circle amplification, have also been proposed, with most probable implication of the former in the case of short repeats and the latter in the case of long repeats26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidences are also accumulating about rolling-circle replication implication in the amplification of satDNAs33,34, as this mechanism could actually disseminate intragenomically a de novo duplicated segment through replication and reinsertion at other genomic locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After intragenomic dissemination, many small arrays of a given satDNA will be scattered across multiple genomic locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis of the L. migratoria draft genome has shown that the immense majority of the 62 satDNAs were contained in many different contigs, suggesting that either most satDNA arrays contain a variety of interspersed sequences or, most likely, they show many different genomic locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also valid for the 33 chromosome-specific clustered satDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The local amplification of short arrays pre-existing at different loci would explain the patterns observed in SF3 and SF4 (see Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In D. melanogaster, the 1.688 satellite shows long arrays in the heterochromatin of chromosomes 2, 3 and X, but it is also found as short arrays (15 repeats) in the euchromatin of the same chromosomes29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, large blocks of the Responder satellite are found in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of chromosome 2 in D. melanogaster, but small blocks are also present in the euchromatin35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a same satellite DNA can be present as short arrays at many cytologically invisible genomic locations and also as long arrays at discrete clusters revealed by FISH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remarkably, satellite DNA sequences also exist in bacteria, as variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) have been reported in several species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, Bacillus anthracis shows VNTRs with repeat size ranging from 2 to 36bp and array size from 1 to 23 repeats36, Salmonella enterica subsp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  enterica shows VNTRs with monomer size between 6bp and 189bp, with array size of 415 repeats37, and Streptococcus uberus shows VNTRs from 12 to 208bp monomer length and 25 repeats per array38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high similarity of repeat size between bacteria and the animal and plant species analyzed here, and the resemblance of the short arrays length and dissemination pattern, suggest that satellite DNA is a common phenomenon to prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only difference lies in maximum array size, which is much more limited in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SatDNA clustering appears to be a eukaryotic innovation presumably facilitated by their large genomes, but total amount of satDNA is likely limited by genomic constraints and natural selection, as in prokaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that 48 satDNAs in L. migratoria are clustered, and only 11 are non-clustered, might suggest that clustering is a dead end for satDNA evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that the reverse pathway is conceivable through the action of natural selection when satDNA amounts become a burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course satellitome analysis in other species will throw much light on this subject.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the equilocal distribution of different clustered satDNA families within a same eukaryotic genome needs an explanation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certainly, the presence of short arrays acting as seeds at many genomic locations may facilitate contagious equilocal satDNA amplification through unequal crossing over during meiotic bouquet, since this kind of recombination requires the presence of at least short arrays of the same satDNA in different non-homologous chromosomes, and previous dissemination provides them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an interesting prospect for future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We collected males and females of Locusta migratoria at Padul (Granada) and Los Barrios (Cádiz) in the South of the Iberian Peninsula.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals from Cádiz were kept alive in the laboratory to obtain embryo offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the extremely high frequency of supernumerary (B) chromosomes in Spanish field populations39, it is very difficult to find B-lacking individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we obtained males and females from a pet shop whose laboratory culture lacks B chromosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed a B-carrying male from Padul with a B-lacking female from the culture, and the male offspring was analyzed cytologically to choose one B-lacking individual, following protocols in Cabrero et al.39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then extracted genomic DNA (gDNA) with the GenElute Mamalian Genomic DNA Miniprep kit (Sigma) and sequenced the gDNA library (insert size=226±81bp) in the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform yielding about 6 Gb data of 2×101 nt paired-end reads, ~1× coverage for the gDNA [SRA:SRR2911427].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also used gDNA Illumina reads (2×100 nt) stored in SRA from the L. migratoria Chinese individual used for the genome assembling performed by Wang et al.11 [SRA:SRR764583], randomly selecting the same number of reads as for the Spanish gDNA library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better characterize the Spanish and Chinese genomes used in this study, we assembled their full mitogenome with MITObim40 and built a maximum-likelihood tree with PhyML v341 also including the sequences used by Ma et al.42 [GenBank:JN858148JN858212, GenBank:NC_011114-NC011115] to define the Northern and Southern lineages in this species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Supplementary Fig S6 shows, the Spanish genome was grouped with the populations from the Southern lineage, and the Chinese genome was included within the Northern lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the performace of our satDNA mining protocol in comparison with a typical Repeat Explorer run, we applied it to a gDNA Illumina library (2×101 nt) from Luzula elegans [SRA:ERR149838] previously analyzed13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bioinformatic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed satMiner, a toolkit for mining and analyzing satDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scripts and running instructions are freely available in GitHub (https://github.com/fjruizruano/satminer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The satMiner protocol consists of the high-throughput extraction of satDNA sequences and their subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For satDNA mining, we performed a protocol for assembly and identification of satDNA families based on the RepeatExplorer software10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the number of reads for a RepeatExplorer run is computationally restricted to a few millions, and in order to identify as many satDNA families as possible, our protocol included filtering out reads showing high similarity with previously known sequences (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first step consists in discarding low quality reads with Trimmomatic43, by removing adapters and selecting read pairs with all their nucleotides, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2×100 or 2×101, with Q20, using the options ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:[100/101].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We randomly selected 2×250,000 reads with SeqTK (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) and run RepeatExplorer with default options and a custom database of repeated sequences, in addition to Repbase v20.1044, last accessed October 28, 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We manually selected the clusters with spherical or ring-shaped structure and density values (i. e. the mean number of links per read) being higher than 0.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each cluster we chose the contigs showing the highest coverage and generated a dotplot with Geneious v4.845.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we detected tandem structure, we split the contigs in monomers to align them and generate a consensus monomer for each contig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then chose a new collection of reads and those that matched previously detected satDNAs were filtered out with the DeconSeq v0.4.3 software46, with default options, before a new RepeatExplorer run was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used satDNA dimers as reference and, in case of dimers shorter than 200bp, we concatenated so many monomers as needed to surpass this length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mismatched reads were then assembled in a new run of RepeatExplorer to search for the presence of satDNAs being poorly represented in the crude reads but detectable in the filtered ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure increased very much the number of analyzed reads without dramatically increasing computational effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we run RepeatExplorer with 2×500,000 filtered reads, searched for new satDNAs and filter them out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We repeated this process two more times adding 2×500,000 reads in each iteration, until no new satDNA was detected by RepeatExplorer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We mined satDNAs following the same steps in parallel for the gDNA libraries from the Northern and Southern lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For satDNA sequence analysis, we compared the consensus sequences of all satDNAs found in order to investigate possible homology between some of them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we aligned each satDNA against the whole satDNA catalog with RepeatMasker v4.0.547, using the Cross_match search engine, recording all matches between satDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When sequences showed less than 80% of identity we considered them as different satDNA families sharing a same superfamily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences showing identity higher than 80% were considered variants of the same family, and those showing identity higher than 95% were considered the same variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We numbered satDNA families in order of decreasing abundance in the Southern lineage individual [GenBank:KU056702KU056808].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We built a minimum spanning tree for DNA sequences in each superfamily with Arlequin v3.548, considering each indel position as a single change and representing the relative abundance among Southern and Northern individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used RepeatMasker47 with -a option to estimate abundance and divergence for each satDNA variant in gDNA libraries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected 2×5 millions of paired reads where all nucleotides met quality criteria applied for the satMiner protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abundance estimates provided by RepeatMasker showed highly significant positive correlation with those yielded by RepeatExplorer in both the Southern (Spearman rs=0.84, N=15, P=0.000074) and Northern (rs=0.97, N=17, Pless_than0.000001) lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to RepeatExplorer, RepeatMasker has the advantage of working on a much higher number of reads, with reasonable computing times, and it can simultaneously estimate the abundance of all satDNA variants previously collected, whereas several runs of RepeatExplorer are necessary to obtain the whole collection of satDNAs, using different reads thus making it difficult normalization, especially for rare variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the average divergence generating a repeat landscape considering distances from the sequences applying the Kimura 2-parameter model with the script calcDivergenceFromAlign.pl within the RepeatMasker suite47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the resulting output, we calculated the weighed mean divergence for each satDNA family, considering all variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we estimated each satDNA family abundance as the sum of nucleotides for all variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We normalized per the number of selected nucleotides and represented abundance as percentage of the library, i.e., genome proportion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated the frequency of random occurrence for some short satDNA monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we generated 1,000 Gb, i.e., ~159 genomes, shuffling nucleotides with the uShuffle program49 preserving the dinucleotide frequencies of the assembled genome of L. migratoria11, accession number AVCP000000000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we analyzed the abundance of some satDNA families in these artificial genomes by using RepeatMasker47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each satDNA family, we scored the number of contigs where at least 200bp were present, and also scored the number of nucleotides aligning in each contig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Primer_design_and_PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested the reliability of the satDNAs found and synthtesized FISH DNA-probes by PCR amplification of all satDNA families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we aligned each satDNA monomers to get a consensus sequence and selected the most conserved region to design primers in opposite orientation ensuring to minimize the distance between them or even overlapping them up to 3bp at the 5 end, when necessary (Supplementary Table S8, Supplementary Fig S7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we used the Primer3 software50 with an optimal melting temperature of 60°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, for monomers shorter than 50bp, we designed primers manually with a similar melting temperature and with the less stable extensive dimers predicted by the software PerlPrimer51 (Supplementary Fig S7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For families with monomer longer than 50bp, we performed PCR amplification with a starting denaturation step of 95°C during 5min, 35 cycles with 94°C during 20s, with 5565°C as annealing temperature during 40s and 72°C during 20s and a final extension step of 7min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We checked the resulting products in a 2% agarose gel to see the typical ladder pattern of tandem repeats (Supplementary Fig S7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We trimmed the band of the monomer for the annealing temperature with less smear and extracted the DNA squeezing it in a parafilm square.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reamplified 0.5L of the resulting solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For satDNAs shorter than 50bp, we reduced the time of annealing to 10s in order to get longer amplicons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This PCR displayed a smear (Supplementary Fig S7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a reamplification using 0.2L of the previous PCR product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We purified all PCR products using the GenElute PCR Clean Up kit (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We only got success for 59 satDNAs, 25 of which were Sanger sequenced and the reliability of the PCR product was confirmed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Physical_mapping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All these PCR products were labeled by nick translation with 2.5 units of DNA polymerase I/DNase I (Invitrogen), following the standard protocol, to be used as DNA probes for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mapping of satDNAs was performed following the protocol described in Cabrero et al.52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FISH probes were labeled with tetramethylrhodamine-5-dUTP (satDNAs) or fluorescein-12-dUTP (rDNA and histone H3 genes) from Roche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
L. migratoria chromosomes are all acrocentric and the autosomes can be classified into three size groups: long (L1 and L2), medium (M3M8) and short (S9S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X chromosome is the third element in size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous research has shown that, in this species, the 45S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is distally located on L2 and M6, and interstitially on S9 chromosomes53, whereas a single histone gene cluster is interstitially located on M854.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed these two markers to perform double FISH with selected satDNAs located on M chromosomes scarcely differing in size, to identify the satDNA-carrying chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it is known that the L1 autosome carries the U1 snRNA gene cluster55, but we differentiated this chromosome from L2 because the latter carries a distal cluster of rDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We distinguished three types of satDNA localization: proximal to centromere in any chromosome arm (p), interstitial in the long arm (i) and distal to centromere in the long arm (d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most FISH analyses were performed on embryo preparations made following Camacho et al.14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analyses included non parametric Spearman rank correlation, Wilcoxon matched pairs test, Wilcoxon one-sample test and Mann-Whitney test, all of them performed with Statistica soft.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contingency chi-square tests were performed with the RXC program (George Carmody, University of Ottawa, Canada) by a Monte Carlo approach to calculate statistical significance, with 5,000 permutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When multiple tests were performed, the resulting probability was corrected by the sequential Bonferroni method56, represented here as Pb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
