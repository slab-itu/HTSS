IRE1-XBP1 is a novel branch in the transcriptional regulation of Ucp1 in brown adipocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unfolded protein response (UPR) not only resolves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, but also regulates cellular physiological functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we first linked the UPR to the physiological roles of brown adipose tissue (BAT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAT is one of the tissues that control energy homeostasis in the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brown adipocytes are able to dissipate energy in the form of heat owing to their mitochondrial protein, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that one of the UPR branches, the IRE1-XBP1 pathway, was activated during the transcriptional induction of Ucp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibiting the IRE1-XBP1 pathway reduced the induction of Ucp1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the activation of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway by ER stress never upregulated Ucp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) induced Ucp1 transcription through the activation of IRE1-XBP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibition of PKA abrogated the activation of IRE1-XBP1 pathway, while the inhibition of a p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), which is one of the downstream molecules of PKA, never suppressed the activation of IRE1-XBP1 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that PKA-dependent IRE1-XBP1 activation is crucial for the transcriptional induction of Ucp1 in brown adipocytes, and they demonstrate a novel, ER stress -independent role of the UPR during thermogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central cellular organelle that is responsible for the folding and post-translational modification of transmembrane and secretory proteins, as well as lipid synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various genetic and environmental insults lead to the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions, collectively termed ER stress, have the potential to induce cellular damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excessive ER stress ultimately leads to apoptotic cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eukaryotic cells are equipped with a system, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), that prevents the cellular damage and death induced by ER stress1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammalian cells, three major ER stress transducers have been identified: PKR-like ER kinase (PERK)3, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)4,5, and activating factor 6 (ATF6)6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to ER stress, these transducers promote three distinct physiological responses: 1) translational attenuation to decrease the demands made on the organelle7, 2) the transcriptional induction of genes encoding ER-resident chaperones to facilitate protein folding6,8, and 3) ER-associated degradation (ERAD) to degrade unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the last decade, a number of studies have indicated that the UPR has crosstalk with other signals and participates in regulating cellular physiological functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that UPR signals from the ER are indispensable for the differentiation of plasma cells11, astrocytes12, osteoblasts13,14, chondrocytes15, and goblet cells16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, it was also demonstrated that the UPR is involved in cellular proliferation or tumorigenesis17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, it was revealed that changes in the lipid composition of the ER membrane bilayer can activate ER stress transducers, leading to the regulation of lipid metabolism18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the UPR has diverse roles beyond getting rid of unfolded or misfolded proteins from the ER lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of the three major ER stress transducers, IRE1 is the most evolutionarily conserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its kinase domain, IRE1 also has an endo-nuclease domain4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of IRE1 via dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation causes the unconventional splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) mRNA by its nuclease activity20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spliced Xbp1 (sXbp1)-encoded proteins can translocate into the nucleus and induce the expression of ER-resident chaperones and ERAD components21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was suggested that this IRE1-XBP1 pathway directly influences lipid metabolism by regulating the expression of lipogenic genes such as Dgat2, Scd1, and Acc223.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, obesity impairs sXBP1 activity in the liver, and overexpression of sXBP1 in obese or diabetic mice improves the blood glucose level to euglycemia24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, it is believed that sXBP1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of lipid and glucose homeostasis, as well as in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, including obesity and diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a key tissue that controls the energy balance of whole body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excessive energy is dissipated in the form of heat by brown adipocytes specialized for thermogenesis27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAT plays important roles in protecting neonates and small mammals, such as mice, against cold30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unique metabolic properties of brown adipocytes result from their densely packed mitochondria containing uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in their inner membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UCP1 is almost exclusively expressed in brown adipocytes, and it is a proton transporter that allows protons to leak into the mitochondrial matrix without ATP synthesis, which leads to thermogenesis31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcription of Ucp1 is regulated by several transcriptional factors and co-regulators, including activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), cyclic-AMP (cAMP) responsive element binding protein (CREB), and peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1)28,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this energy consumption system in BAT is attractive for counteracting obesity and its related metabolic diseases33, it is important to understand the mechanisms that increase Ucp1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we first uncovered a physiological role of UPR in BAT, and we demonstrated that the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is activated in a PKA-dependent manner and plays a crucial role in the transcriptional induction of Ucp1 in brown adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The_UPR_is_activated_during_the_transcriptional_induction_of_Ucp1_in_brown_adipocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine whether UPR is activated in response to stimuli leading to thermogenesis in brown adipocytes, we exposed C57BL/6 mice to cold (4°C) for 24h, isolated mRNA from BAT, and then measured the expression levels of UPR-related genes by real-time PCR analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well known that cold exposure promotes the transcription of Ucp1 for thermogenesis27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, a significant elevation of Ucp1 mRNA levels was observed in BAT of mice exposed to cold (4°C) for 24h compared with control mice that were kept at 28°C (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of the ER-resident chaperones Bip, Grp94, and Calreticulin was significantly upregulated by cold exposure (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to western -blotting (WB) analysis, the levels of Bip proteins significantly increased, and GRP94 and a component of the UPR signal, ATF4, tended to increase after cold exposure (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-PCR analysis showed an increase in the level of sXbp1 mRNA in BAT exposed to cold (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the mRNA level of ERdj4, which is a target gene of sXBP1, also increased (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cold exposure promotes not only thermogenesis, but also various physiological responses in BAT, such as angiogenesis34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we next asked whether the increase in the expression of UPR-related genes was due to thermogenesis in brown adipocytes in response to cold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Norepinephrine is a major activator of brown adipocytes that promotes Ucp1 expression by binding to the 3 adrenergic receptor (3-AR), which is expressed mainly in adipose tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with a 3-AR agonist such as CL 316,243 can mimic cold exposure in brown adipocytes27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, subcutaneous injection of CL 316,243 (1mg/kg) induced a significant increase in Ucp1 mRNA levels in BAT (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of the ER-resident chaperones, Bip, Grp94, and Calreticulin, as well as sXbp1 mRNA, was increased by CL 316,243 (Supplementary Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of primary brown adipocytes with 1M CL 316,243 transiently elevated Ucp1 mRNA levels, which peaked 3h after treatment (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of Bip and Grp94 was also upregulated by treatment with CL 316,243, and this increase in expression remained until 9h after treatment (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, splicing of Xbp1 mRNA increased in accordance with the expression pattern of Ucp1 (Fig 1g), implying that sXBP1 acts during an early phase of the physiological response of brown adipocytes to norepinephrine, although ER-resident chaperones may not be needed until a later phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_IRE1-XBP1_pathway_is_predominantly_activated_during_the_induction_of_Ucp1_transcription  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we examined which branch in the UPR is important for the transcriptional induction of Ucp1 in brown adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the largest increase in Ucp1 mRNA was observed 3h after the treatment of primary brown adipocytes with CL 316,243, we conducted WB analysis to measure a change in the amount of phosphorylated PERK, eIF2, and IRE1, or N-terminus of ATF6 until 3h after treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2a, treatment with 1M CL 316,243 never induced the phosphorylation of PERK or its substrate eIF2, whereas treatment with the ER stressor thapsigargin (Tg) substantially increased the phosphorylation of both proteins in primary brown adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cleaved fragment of ATF6 (ATF6 N-terminus) did not increase after treatment with CL 316,243 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the phosphorylation of IRE1 significantly increased 30min after treatment with CL 316,243 (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicated that IRE1 is predominantly activated downstream of the 3-AR pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not known the reason why the phosphorylation of IRE1 swiftly went back to the basal level, while sXbp1 mRNA was detected until 6h after CL 316,243 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculated two possibilities: 1) Because our antibody detects only phosphorylation of Ser 724 of IRE1, the other phosphorylation sites in multiple phosphorylation sites of IRE1 could be phosphorylated with CL 316,243 treatment time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) Because the stability of sXbp1 mRNA is high, sXbp1 mRNA could escape from rapid degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Binding of norepinephrine to the 3-AR activates adenylyl cyclase, leading to an increase in the concentration of cAMP and an increase in PKA activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the 3-AR pathway affects the activation of IRE1, we treated primary brown adipocytes with forskolin (FSK), an activator of adenylyl cyclase, which thereby results in an increase in intracellular cAMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ucp1 was upregulated by treatment with 20M FSK, although the level of upregulation was less than that observed following CL 316,243 treatment (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WB analysis showed that PERK and eIF2 were never phosphorylated after treatment with FSK (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATF6 N-terminus also did not increase after treatment with FSK (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that the PERK and ATF6 branches do not play crucial roles in the transcriptional induction of Ucp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the phosphorylation of IRE1 and the splicing of Xbp1 mRNA were enhanced after treatment with FSK compared with the CL 316,243 treatment (Fig 2g,h), indicating that the activation of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is the most important of the three UPR branches in the induction of Ucp1 transcription by the 3-AR pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_IRE1-XBP1_pathway_is_essential_for_the_transcriptional_induction_of_Ucp1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is mainly involved in the transcriptional induction of Ucp1, we first attempted to investigate the effects of the knockdown of Xbp1 in brown adipocytes using lentiviral vectors, because primary mature brown adipocytes do not proliferate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we could not detect green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence in primary mature brown adipocytes infected with lentiviruses expressing GFP, indicating that the knockdown of Xbp1 in mature brown adipocytes is technically difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of gene silencing experiments, we treated primary brown adipocytes with 30M 48C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48C inhibits the nuclease activity of IRE1 by directly binding to its active site without affecting its kinase activity or its overall dimerization or oligomerization states35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this compound, we successfully depleted the splicing of Xbp1 mRNA induced by the 3-AR pathway (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantification of Ucp1 mRNA levels demonstrated a significant decrease after treatment with 48C compared with treatment with CL 316,243 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with 48C also inhibited the splicing of Xbp1 mRNA and the upregulation of Ucp1 expression following FSK treatment (Supplementary Fig 3a,b), suggesting that the IRE1-XBP1 pathway plays a crucial role in the transcriptional induction of Ucp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ER stress activates the IRE-XBP1 pathway, we next examined whether ER stress is able to induce the transcription of Ucp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary brown adipocytes were treated with various concentrations of tunicamycin (Tm), which blocks N-linked glycosylation and causes ER stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tm treatment caused significant splicing of Xbp1 mRNA (Fig 3c), but never induced Ucp1 transcription (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the activation of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway by the 3-AR pathway, which leads to the transcriptional induction of Ucp1, could occur independently of the canonical UPR that is induced by ER stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we tested whether sXBP1 directly promotes the transcription of Ucp1 because sXBP1 is a transcription factor that includes a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well known that sXBP1 binds to the cis-acting ER stress response element (ERSE, CCAAT-N9-CCACG or ERSEII, ATTGG-N-CCACG36), and the mammalian unfolded protein response element (UPRE, TGACGTGG/A22) (underlined sequences indicate core sequences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A search using the murine genome database (Ensembl genome browser GRCm38) for these binding sequences in the promoter region (up to 4kb upstream) of Ucp1 identified several UPRE and ERSE core sequences (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Especially, we found two UPRE and one ERSE core sequences within 1 -kb of Ucp1, implying that sXBP1 directly binds these elements to promote Ucp1 transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify this possibility, we performed luciferase assay using a reporter plasmid that contained a 3.8-kb promoter of murine Ucp137.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We transfected the reporter plasmid into C3H10T1/2 cells, which is a murine mesenchymal stem cell line that has been used to examine Ucp1 promoter activity37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that the activation of PKA by the FSK treatment increased the reporter activity (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-PCR analysis showed the FSK treatment slightly increased Xbp1 splicing level in C3H10T1/2 cells (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the introduction of sXBP1-expression vectors into C3H10T1/2 cells never increased in the reporter activity, although sXbp1 mRNA level was higher than the FSK treatment (Fig 3e and Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the treatment with FSK of cells that were introduced with sXBP1-expression vectors showed the reporter activity more than FSK treatment alone (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the introduction of vectors expressing a mutant sXBP1 lacking bZIP domain (bZIP-sXBP1), which is not able to bind to DNA, never showed the reporter activity more than FSK treatment alone (Fig 3e and Supplementary Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggested that sXBP1 directly upregulates Ucp1 by cooperating with other factors induced by the activation of PKA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_IRE1-XBP1_pathway_is_activated_in_a_PKA_dependent_manner  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above findings led us to hypothesize that the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is activated by the 3-AR pathway during the transcriptional induction of Ucp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 3-AR signaling cascade, cAMP-dependent PKA activation leads to the phosphorylation of a p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, active p38 MAPK drives the transcriptional induction of Ucp1 by the directly phosphorylating both ATF2 and PGC132.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we found that IRE1 was heavily phosphorylated following FSK treatment, we first examined whether treatment with a PKA inhibitor H89 affects the IRE1-XBP1 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of primary brown adipocytes with 40M H89 suppressed the CL 316,243-induced expression of Ucp1 (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, IRE1 phosphorylation and Xbp1 mRNA splicing were also reduced drastically (Fig 4b,c), indicating that activation of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is dependent on PKA activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, to determine whether p38 MAPK regulates the activation of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway, we treated primary brown adipocytes with a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with 20M SB203580 significantly decreased the level of Ucp1 mRNA (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, treatment with SB203580 failed to suppress IRE1 phosphorylation and Xbp1 mRNA splicing (Fig 4e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings were contrary to our expectations because inhibiting the IRE1-XBP1 pathway significantly decreased the transcriptional induction of Ucp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p38 MAPK has been reported to regulate the translocation of sXBP1 from the cytosol into the nucleus via phosphorylation38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to determine whether SB203580 treatment inhibits the translocation of sXBP1 into the nucleus, we performed WB analysis using the nuclear fraction from brown adipocytes co-treated with CL 316,243 and SB203580.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-treatment with CL 316,243 and SB203580 significantly reduced the amount of sXBP1 protein in the nucleus, which was increased by treatment with CL 316,243 (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, it was clear that the phosphorylation of IRE1 and the splicing of Xbp1 mRNA occur in a PKA-dependent manner, and that the translocation of sXBP1 into the nucleus is regulated by p38 MAPK in brown adipocytes stimulated with norepinephrine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent studies have suggested that signals mediated by the UPR are key factors that regulate lipid or glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, it has also been demonstrated that transgenic mice, in which UPR signaling was modulated, showed metabolic phenotypes, such as resistance to obesity39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we demonstrated that the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is highly activated compared with the other UPR branches during the induction of Ucp1 transcription in brown adipocytes, and its induction mechanism is independent of ER stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, robust phosphorylation of IRE1 occurred within 30min after treatment with CL 316,243 or FSK, which is not enough time for misfolded or unfolded proteins to accumulate in the ER lumen without treatment with ER stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings suggest that the 3-AR pathway activates the IRE1-XBP1 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, it was reported that IRE1 in the liver is phosphorylated directly by PKA in response to glucagon41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The glucagon receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that belongs to the same family as the 3-AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of glucagon to its receptor activates PKA in a cAMP-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, treating hepatocytes with glucagon or epinephrine induced the phosphorylation of IRE1, which was abrogated by co-treatment with H89.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actually, we observed that treatment with H89 greatly suppressed the phosphorylation of IRE1 in brown adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is conceivable that the robust phosphorylation of IRE1 is mediated by PKA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study also showed that the inhibition of p38 MAPK suppressed the induction of Ucp1 following treatment with CL 316,243, but it never suppressed IRE1 phosphorylation and Xbp1 mRNA splicing, indicating that the activation of PKA induced by the binding of norepinephrine to the 3-AR causes the phosphorylation of IRE1 and the subsequent splicing of Xbp1 mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the amount of nuclear sXBP1 in brown adipocytes treated with SB203580 was reduced compared with that following CL 316,243 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p38 MAPK has been reported to phosphorylate sXBP1 on amino acid residues Thr 48 and Ser 61, and the phosphorylation of these residues is crucial for the translocation of sXBP1 into the nucleus38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, we suggest that the 3-AR pathway has two roles: 1) it activates the phosphorylation of IRE1 and the splicing of Xbp1 mRNA during the transcriptional induction of Ucp1 downstream of PKA, and 2) it regulates the nuclear translocation of sXBP1 to promote its transcriptional activity downstream of p38 MAPK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model of the regulation of Ucp1 transcription is summarized in Fig 4h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, the increase in the level of sXbp1 mRNA after treatment with Tm never caused the upregulation of Ucp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sXBP1 is a transcription factor that includes bZIP domain, and it binds to ERSEs and UPREs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found sXBP1 binding sites, two UPRE-like and one ERSE-like sequences within 1-kb upstream of Ucp1, but the expression of sXBP1 never increased the reporter activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that bZIP transcription factors heterodimerize with other transcription factors through their bZIP domain to alter their binding sites, which means that a target gene is selected depending upon the combination of a counter transcription factors42,43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, ATF6 dimerizes with sXBP1 and binds to an UPRE, which ATF6 is not able to bind by itself46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the ATF6-sXBP1 heterodimer possesses eight-fold higher binding affinity for the UPRE than the sXBP1 homodimer46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we demonstrated that a combination of sXBP1 expression and FSK treatment enhanced the reporter activity, which was higher than that of the FSK treatment alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data implies that sXBP1 acts as a transcription factor for Ucp1 by forming a heterodimer with a counterpart induced by the 3-AR pathway during thermogenesis in brown adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The failure of Tm to induce the transcription of Ucp1 could be due to differences in the sets of transcription factors induced by the 3-AR pathway and ER stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To elucidate this possibility, the identification of a counterpart of sXBP1 in the transcriptional induction of Ucp1 and further experiments are needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also found an increase in the expression of ER-resident chaperones in brown adipocytes stimulated by cold exposure and CL 316,243.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the increase in expression of ER-resident chaperones persisted after treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the transcription of Ucp1, the uptake and utilization of lipids and glucose increases in brown adipocytes during thermogenesis47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes involved in glucose uptake, such as the glucose transporter, GLUT4, are especially upregulated in BAT exposed to cold48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the secretion of several proteins, for example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), also increases in brown adipocytes stimulated by cold or other activators34,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cellular responses demand an increase in the folding capacity of the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the transcription of ER-resident chaperones is promoted to process transmembrane and secretory proteins effectively in preparation for the impending acute protein load on the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we first suggested that the UPR is coupled to the transcriptional induction of Ucp1 in brown adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it remains unclear how relevant and important the IRE1-XBP1 pathway actually is in activating Ucp1 transcription in vivo, our work provided a great possibility that the UPR plays a crucial role in brown adipocytes to upregulate Ucp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in Ucp1 expression could raise the energy expenditure of the body, and prevent the accumulation of excess fat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, if a contribution of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway to energy consumption in vivo is elucidated, the IRE1-XBP1 pathway in brown adipocytes may have a potential for treating obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
