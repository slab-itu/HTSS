Polymer Morphological Change Induced by Terahertz Irradiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As terahertz (THz) frequencies correspond to those of the intermolecular vibrational modes in a polymer, intense THz wave irradiation affects the macromolecular polymorph, which determines the polymer properties and functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  THz photon energy is quite low compared to the covalent bond energy; therefore, conformational changes can be induced softly, without damaging the chemical structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we irradiate a poly(3-hydroxybutylate) (PHB) / chloroform solution during solvent casting crystallization using a THz wave generated by a free electron laser (FEL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphological observation shows the formation of micrometer-sized crystals in response to the THz wave irradiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, a 1020% increase in crystallinity is observed through analysis of the infrared (IR) absorption spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak power density of the irradiating THz wave is 40MW/cm2, which is significantly lower than the typical laser intensities used for material manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate for the first time that the THz wave effectively induces the intermolecular rearrangement of polymer macromolecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the higher-order conformation determines the physical, chemical, and biological properties of polymers, technology to control macromolecular polymorphs is an important research topic for material science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that high-power laser irradiation can perturb polymer morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, polymer nucleation1 and micelle aggregation4 via Nd:YAG laser irradiation focused by an objective lens has been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, light-induced protein crystal formation has been achieved using tightly focused femtosecond lasers to irradiate a protein solution (10101011W/cm2)5,6 Thus, laser irradiation has the potential to become a new tool for novel macromolecular polymorphism creation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent remarkable progress in the development of high-power terahertz (THz) sources is introducing the possibility of material structure manipulation7,8 Pump-probe experiments using THz pulsed lasers have facilitated observation of various picosecond transient phenomena, such as the ionization of electrons induced by the ponderomotive force9,10, the THz-induced insulatormetal phase transition11, molecular alignment in the gas phase12,13, and highly excited intermolecular vibration via ladder climbing14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intense THz wave can influence the molecular and carrier dynamics of a material; however, it is difficult to produce a fixed material structure in this manner, because of the rapid relaxation of the excited state to thermal equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An irreversible process is required to maintain the instantaneous structure following THz irradiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we irradiate a poly(3-hydroxybutylate) (PHB) / chloroform solution with THz waves during solvent casting crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PHB is one of the polymers for which the vibrational modes in both the infrared15 and THz regions16,17 are well assigned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the infrared spectra (C=O str.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  region), the crystalline and amorphous structures are clearly distinguishable via the frequency shift, which enables quantitative analysis of the crystallinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the THz region, some vibrational modes are coupled with the intermolecular hydrogen bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the THz-wave photon energy corresponds to the vibrational energy of the polymer hydrogen bonds16,17,18, the THz waves can excite intermolecular motion effectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the THz photon energy is quite low compared to that of the covalent bonds; thus, the conformational change occurs softly, without damaging the chemical structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained polymer structure can be fixed following the irradiation, because of the irreversibility of the solvent casting crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experimental setup used in this study is shown in Fig 1, and further details of the experimental procedure are available in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2 shows optical microscope images, IR spectra, and IR images of PHB films grown with and without THz irradiation (center wavelength  =57m, average macropulse energy ETHz=3.9mJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2(a) shows the images obtained by a low-magnification polarized microscope in the reflection setup, with the polarizers set to a cross-Nicol configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences are apparent with sample rotation, for both the specimens with and without THz irradiation; this indicates the absence of birefringence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The image contrasts are primarily due to scattering by the micrometer-sized structures in the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2(b) shows magnified images of the sample centers obtained using a laser confocal microscope (Olympus: OLS3100) in the transmission setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A clear morphological difference can be observed between the two samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without THz irradiation, a few micrometer-sized structures are uniformly distributed throughout the observed area, in which a number of dark, micrometer-sized, curved structures are randomly tangled (I and II in Fig 2(b)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the results of previous morphological studies19, the random and complex structures can be understood as multi-shape early-grown spherulite structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the THz-irradiated sample is composed of bright, needle-shaped structures with ~1-m thickness (III) and dark structure aggregates (IV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sizes and shapes of the needle-shaped structures are quite similar to those of PHB single crystals slowly grown from a dilute solution20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The round-shaped aggregates in Fig 2(b) (IV) appear to be spherulite structures comprised of smaller crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of these two structures strongly suggests that this specimen has higher crystallinity than the un-irradiated material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To estimate the crystallinity of the PHB films quantitatively, IR spectroscopic images were obtained using an FT-IR microscope (JASCO: FT/IRT-7200).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2(c) shows the absorption spectra measured at the PHB film centers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that the C=O stretching band reflects the PHB crystalline structures15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, crystalline PHB exhibits a sharp peak at 17221723cm1, while amorphous PHB has a broad absorption band at ~1740cm115.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dashed lines in Fig 2(c) show the result of a least-squares fitting of two Gaussian functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, the crystallinity, i.e., the molar ratio between the crystalline and amorphous PHB, is defined by the ratio of the integrated absorption intensities of those two peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the crystallinity values in Fig 2(c) are 37% and 57% without and with THz irradiation, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PHB crystallinity induced by the solvent casting crystallization is remarkably lower than that of typical melt-crystallized samples (~55%)21, suggesting that the PHB metastable structure changes to a stable polymorph under THz wave irradiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Figure 2(d) shows the spatial distributions of the crystallinity for both the un-irradiated and irradiated specimens, as determined via 2D imaging spectra measured over an area of 7.4×7.4mm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visualize the crystalline distribution, the intensity ratio of the absorbance between 1722 and 1743cm1 was plotted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the specimen subjected to THz beam irradiation, the center area of ~5-mm diameter was clearly transformed to a high-crystallinity region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the size and shape of that area conform to the THz beam pattern at the sample position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the results shown in Fig 2, we can conclude that the PHB crystallinity was improved by the THz beam irradiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As no significant changes were observed in the other regions of the IR spectra, the PHB chemical structure was not damaged by the THz irradiation and only the higher-order conformation was changed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that similar phenomena, known as laser-induced crystallization, have been reported in various studies since the 1990s22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In those cases, the nucleation from the solution was accelerated under the tightly focused laser pulses, in which the energy fluence was of the order of GW/cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under such conditions, it was possible for the nucleation to be triggered by various non-linear phenomena, such as chemical reactions with multi-photon excitation, clustering with photon pressure, and molecular ionization by ponderomotive forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the peak power of the THz micropulses in this study is ~40MW/cm2 and, therefore, non-linear effects are almost negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The simplest explanation of the observed crystallization involves the thermal effect, because polymer crystallization is easily affected by slight changes in the sample temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the average sample temperature during the THz wave irradiation process by dipping a K-type thermocouple directly into the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the center of the THz beam spot, the temperature increase was less than 1°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we crystallized PHB films without THz irradiation by changing the temperature from 22 to 32°C, and the corresponding FT-IR spectra indicated that the difference in the crystallinity was negligible in this temperature region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the increased crystallinity observed in the THz-irradiated specimens in this study was not caused by the average temperature increase induced by the THz irradiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another explanation is that the THz wave directly excites intermolecular vibration and induces a conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3, the sample crystallinity is plotted as a function of the THz energy density and for different THz wavelengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A clear correlation can be seen between the THz energy density and crystallinity; however, the dependence on the THz wavelength is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4 shows the THz absorption spectra of (a) crystalline PHB23 (b) a PHB solution with chloroform, and pure chloroform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results for the 57- and 100-m THz wavelengths overlap the vibrational band of the crystalline PHB, with the transition dipole moments being parallel to the b- and c- crystal axes, respectively17 Note that, if the crystallization were induced by excitation of those vibrational modes, the on- and off-resonance of the wavelength would result in significant differences in the sizes and orientations of the different wavelengths shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this is not the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the above results, the majority of the THz energy radiated onto the sample is absorbed by the dissolved PHB and chloroform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorbance of the PHB solution with chloroform and that of pure chloroform are shown in Fig 4(b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The THz wave energy is primarily absorbed by the chloroform, and the instantaneous increase in the temperature due to the micropulse may cause shockwave generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant chain of shockwaves may trigger a structural change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the conformational change in the PHB from the metastable (lower crystallinity) to the stable (higher crystallinity) structure may be triggered by this type of weak perturbation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, it has recently been reported that the crystallization of acetaminophen from the metastable phase is induced by ultrasonic irradiation24 Similar phenomena may occur in PHB solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, laser-induced shockwave generation is observed for laser energy fluence of the order of GW/cm2 in the near infrared region but, in our case, the THz beam energy fluence is more than 100 times lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the near infrared lasers are employed, the photon energy is too far from the energy of the intermolecular motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the THz frequency overlaps with the intermolecular vibrational modes of solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The THz wave energy can be effectively transferred to shockwave generation, because the THz wave irradiation can excite the intermolecular motion directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the mechanism behind the THz-radiation-induced morphological change remains unclear, we can change the intermolecular conformation of bulk materials softly, without damaging the chemical structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This advantage will facilitate material control of fragile molecules such as bio-macromolecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that the use of THz irradiation may constitute a new method that is applicable not only to polymer science, but also to biological science, as a means of discovering new functional materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A THz-free electron laser (FEL) at the Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research (ISIR), Osaka University, was used as the THz beam source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on the THz-FEL can be found elsewhere25,26 The THz-FEL output macro-pulses with a 5-Hz repetition rate, composed of ~100 micropulses with 10-ps duration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The output THz pulse contained several wavelength components within an ~1THz bandwidth (Fig 1(a)), and the center wavelength  was tuned by changing the wiggler gap distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 is a schematic of the experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The THz beam from the FEL was focused by an off-axis parabolic mirror with 102-mm focal length and the sample was offset from the focal point by 25mm, so that the THz radiation was loosely focused on the specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average power of the macropulse ETHz was measured by a pyroelectric detector (Coherent Inc.: J-25MB-LE) and this value was adjusted by a pair of wire-grid polarizers placed in the optical path.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The typical beam pattern (=70m; ETHz=4.5mJ) at the sample position was monitored by a THz camera (NEC: IRV-T0831; Fig 1, inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam radius was approximately 4mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the macropulse energy density was estimated to be ~40mJ/cm2 at the beam center; this corresponds to an ~40-MW/cm2 maximum peak power for the micropulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The THz beam was employed during the formation of the poly(3-hydroxybutylate) (PHB) film sample from a dilute solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  200l of PHB (Aldrich Corp.) solution with chloroform (3.9mg/ml) was dropped on a BaF2 window, which had 19-mm aperture size and was placed horizontally in an Al cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell was at room temperature (24°C) and a PHB film sample was grown on the window through 30-min evaporation of the chloroform solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the evaporation, the center of the sample cell was continuously irradiated by the THz beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following formation of the PHB film, the BaF2 window was detached from the cell and observed under polarized, laser confocal, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy microscopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PHB film samples were also prepared without THz irradiation, using the same growth process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
