Melanosome transfer to keratinocyte in the chicken embryonic skin is mediated by vesicle release associated with Rho-regulated membrane blebbing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During skin pigmentation in amniotes, melanin synthesized in the melanocyte is transferred to keratinocytes by a particle called the melanosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies, mostly using dissociated cultured cells, have proposed several different models that explain how the melanosome transfer is achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using a technique that labels the plasma membrane of melanocytes within a three-dimensional system that mimics natural tissues, we have visualized the plasma membrane of melanocytes with EGFP in chicken embryonic skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal time-lapse microscopy reveals that the melanosome transfer is mediated, at least in part, by vesicles produced by plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, the vesicle release is accompanied by the membrane blebbing of melanocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blebs that have encapsulated a melanosome are pinched off to become vesicles, and these melanosome-containing vesicles are finally engulfed by neighboring keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both the membrane blebbing and vesicle release, Rho small GTPase is essential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that the membrane vesicle-mediated melanosome transfer plays a significant role in the skin pigmentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the skin pigmentation in inter-feather spaces in chickens is similar to that in inter-hair spaces of humans, our findings should have important consequences in cosmetic medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Skin pigmentation is essential to protect the body against ultraviolet irradiation1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In amniotes (birds and mammals), melanin, a main component of skin pigmentation, is synthesized in a specialized organelle called melanosome in the melanocyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The melanosome is transported to the tip of a melanocyte dendrite, a long cellular process, via the cytoskeleton2,3,4,5, and is subsequently translocated to adjacent keratinocytes, which do not produce melanin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the melanocyte-to-keratinocyte transfer of melanosomes (thereafter called melanosome transfer) is an essential process that covers a wide surface of the skin with melanin pigmentation, and therefore the mechanisms of melanosome-transfer have been a central issue in dermatology, cosmetology, and cell biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The melanosome transfer has been conventionally studied either by electron microscopy and/or in vitro analyses using co-culture with dissociated keratinocytes and melanocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies using these techniques have proposed three prominent models to explain how the melanosome transfer is achieved6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First model is that the melanosome-containing tip of a dendrite or filopodium protruding from melanocytes is directly cytophagocytosed by adjacent keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations were made using guinea pig cells8 and human cells10, and the model is corroborated by the finding that the inhibition of myosin X, which is required for the formation of filopodia, disturbs the melanosome transfer15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second model highlights that a melanosome is released from melanocytes as a plasma membrane-enveloped vesicle, which is subsequently incorporated into keratinocytes by phagocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such phenomena were shown using Xenopus cells12, human melanoma cells9, and human foreskin cells16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model was corroborated by Wu et al.18, who showed in time-lapse analyses of in vitro culture cells taken from the skin of transgenic mice that keratinocytes retained melanosome-containing membrane vesicles that had been transferred from the melanocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposal that keratinocytes received their melanin through membrane vesicle-mediated transfer was also supported by a recent study using atomic force microscopy20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The third model proposes that melanin pigments are exocytosed to an extracellular space by fusion of melanosome membrane and plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model has been supported by electron microscopies showing naked melanin pigments in intercellular space6,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tarafder et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  also suggested that exocytosis of melanosomes occurring in cultured human skin cells is regulated by Rab11b21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other models have also been casted including a tunneling nanotube of plasma membrane through which melanosomes are transmitted22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Basically, these postulated mechanisms are each based on the behaviors of cells proliferating in 2-D culture; and it is increasingly appreciated that cellular behaviors in a 2-D environment could profoundly be different from those cultured in 3-D or in vivo23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, whereas in vitro cultured tumor cells are tightly attached to the culture dish with actin stress fibers firmly extended, these cells undergo different behaviors when placed in 3-D environment such as Matrigel, where cytoskeletons are flexibly rearranged with associated plasma membrane blebbing23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while it is important to know how melanosome transfer is achieved in the actual body, there are, at present, no experimental systems that allow direct visualization of melanocytes behavior, particularly in amniotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we established time-lapse live imaging of developing melanocytes using chicken embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At early stages, neural crest cells, the melanocyte precursors, are electroporated with GFP genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these embryos at later stages, a skin tissue retaining the 3-D integrity was dissected and subjected to the live-imaging analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that GFP-melanocytes released membrane vesicles, each of which contained a single (not multiple) melanosome, which were ultimately incorporated into keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This partially confirms previous in vitro studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our surprise, however, the release of membrane vesicles was accompanied by the dynamic blebbing of the plasma membrane, which has previously been unappreciated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that both the membrane blebbing and membrane vesicle production were regulated by Rho protein activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that this mode of melanosome transfer by melanocyte membrane blebbing and vesicle production is essential for skin pigmentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We started our analyses to determine when the melanosome transfer starts during chicken development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We peeled a piece of embryonic skin containing both the epidermis and dermis from a flank region of embryos at different developmental stages, and prepared flat-mounted specimens of the skin (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At embryonic day 8 (E8), melanocytes were recognized as pigmented cells, but no melanosomes were found in neighboring keratinocytes (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By E11, in contrast, melanosomes started to be detected in keratinocytes, and the number of the melanosomes increased onward (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the melanosome transfer must take place around E11E12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A skin piece of E8 embryos was further subjected to time-lapse microscopy after placing it in a glass-bottom dish embedded in agarose-containing medium (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bright field time-lapse observation for 43seconds showed melanosomes moving actively within a melanocyte (Fig 1d, Supplementary video 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For high-resolution live imaging analyses, EGFP-labeling of the plasma membrane of melanocytes was necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome the low efficiency of gene transfection into differentiated melanocytes, we used the in ovo DNA electroporation into neural crest cells, the precursors of melanocytes26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the Tol2 transposon-mediated gene transfer technique was used enabling stable expression of electroporated EGFP cDNA29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, two kinds of plasmids were electroporated into neural crest cells at E2: one was pT2A-CAGGS-gapEGFP (pT2A: Tol2 transposon-carrying vector; gapEGFP: membrane tethered form of EGFP), and the other was pCAGGS-T2TP (T2TP: transposase) (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electroporated embryos were subjected to the aforementioned skin preparation, followed by confocal time-lapse microscopy at E7 (HH 30), E9 (HH 35), or E12 (HH 38) (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At E7, gapEGFP-labeled melanocyte precursors exhibited active protrusion of dendrites and filopodia that repeatedly extended and retracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the dendrites extended 20m long (Fig 2c,d, Supplementary video 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At E9, the behavior of melanocyte precursors was drastically changed: the dendrites harbored multiple bubble-like structures emerging from the plasma membrane, the phenomenon known as membrane blebbing (Fig 2e, Supplementary video 4)31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By E12, some of the membrane blebs were pinched off from the melanocyte, and released as small vesicles, followed by a translocation into keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a and Supplementary video 5 show sequential steps of such vesicle release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, some of the discharged vesicles contained a melanosome (Fig 3a,e, Supplementary video 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of the vesicle release (E10E11) was consistent with the developmental stage when melanosomes started to be detected in keratinocytes (Figs 1a and 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if all the released vesicles were translocated into the keratinocytes, the keratinocytes were visualized by either phalloidin staining or transfection with the gap-mOrange gene (Fig 3c, Supplementary Figure S1)32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By confocal microscopy with Z-stack analyses, 72.8% of discharged vesicles were found within the keratinocytes whereas 27.2% of vesicles remained in extracellular spaces (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each fraction, the number of melanosome-containing vesicles was smaller than that of vacant vesicles: 39.7% and 60.3% inside keratinocytes, and 25.5% and 74.5% outside keratinocytes, respectively (Fig 3d), implying that the melanosome is not requisite for the vesicles to enter the keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vesicles located within the keratinocyte were often enclosed by a phagosome-like structure visualized by gap-mOrange-labeled plasma membrane of keratinocytes (Supplementary Figure S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, melanosome-containing vesicles discharged from the melanocytes are engulfed by keratinocytes through phagocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A majority of the discharged membrane vesicles were less than 1,500nm in diameter (Fig 3e), and therefore classified as plasma membrane vesicles (also called shedding vesicles, microparticles) distinct from exosomes that are much smaller in size33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since not all the membrane vesicles contained a melanosome (Fig 3e), it is unlikely that melanosomes encapsulation by a vesicle is a trigger of the vesicle release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the blebbing has been reported to be characteristic of apoptotic cells35,36, we detected little sign of apoptosis during melanocyte differentiation (Supplementary Figure S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the outer layer of released vesicles was enriched with phosphatidylserine revealed by PSvue staining in vitro with freshly prepared vesicles from E12 embryos (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further explored the molecular mechanisms by which the membrane blebbing and the vesicles release are regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has previously been reported that platelets and invasive cancer cells undergo membrane blebbing and vesicle release, dependent on the activities of members of the small GTPase Rho family31,34,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether Rho signaling would also be important for the membrane vesicle-mediated transfer of melanosomes, Rho-inhibiting constructs, either dominant negative RhoA (DN-RhoA) or botulinum C3, were electroporated into the developing neural crest cells/melanocyte lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of these genes was temporally controlled using the tet-on inducible system38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the effects of Rho-inhibition on the membrane blebbing and vesicle release, doxycycline (analog of tetracycline) was administered to embryos at E7 and E10, respectively (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When RhoA activity was inhibited at E7, the membrane blebbing was markedly reduced by E9 (Fig 4b, Supplementary video 6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendrites of E9 melanocytes introduced with DN-RhoA or C3 were smoother than those of control with a reduced amount of membrane blebs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses also confirmed this observation: whereas the relative number of control EGFP-electroporated cells with membrane blebbing over total melanocytes was 42.5 +/ 0.8%, this was reduced to 4.5 +/ 2.7% (in DN-RhoA-treated cells) and 5.9 +/ 1.9% (in C3-treated cells) (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of Rho signals for the blebbing was corroborated by a pharmaceutical treatment with Y27632 (Rock inhibitor) that resulted in not only a reduction of the blebs but also a generation of filopodia that would normally be seen in immature melanocytes (Fig 2d, Supplementary video 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also found that RhoA was important for the release of membrane vesicles from melanocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of DN-RhoA or C3 at E10 resulted in a significant reduction of vesicle release assessed at E12 (Fig 4d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the average number of released vesicles around an EGFP-control melanocyte was 3.0 +/ 0.5, this was markedly reduced to 1.6 +/ 0.2 when C3 was expressed (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, during the investigation we noticed that the extent of vesicle release implementation was highly variable even among normal embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To more precisely scrutinize the effect of RhoA inhibition on the vesicle release, we assessed the effects in a single embryo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we electroporated cDNAs of mStrawberry (control) and C3/RockDN in separated melanocyte-forming regions of a single embryo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In E2 embryos, a drop of mineral oil was laid in the lumen of neural tube, followed by in ovo electroporation with mStrawberry in the anterior region to the oil and C3 or RockDN in the posterior region (Supplementary Figure S3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the oil drop prevented mixing of DNA solutions in the neural tube, the treated embryo had mStrawberry-positive melanocytes in the anterior skin and C3- or RockDN-positive melanocytes in the posterior with a clear boundary between them (Supplementary Figure S3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the experiment shown in Fig 4e, C3 was activated by Dox at E10, and the effects were assessed at E12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control embryos where melanocytes in the anterior and posterior halves were electroporated with mStrawberry (ST) and EGFP, respectively, a ratio of the number of released membrane vesicles was 1.20 +/ 0.19 (EGFP/ST) (Supplementary Figure S3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, when Rho-A activity was inhibited in the posterior skin, the ratio was markedly reduced to 0.57 +/ 0.05 (C3/ST), and 0.43 +/ 0.07 (RockDN/ST) (Supplementary Figure S3b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, we conclude that the RhoA-Rock signaling is critical for both the membrane blebbing and vesicle release during melanocyte maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we examined whether the inhibition of vesicle release would affect the skin pigmentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the efficiency of DNA electroporation used in above experiments was not high enough to cause a detectable change in skin pigmentation, we used the recently established technique of melanocyte transplantation, which enables gene manipulation in cells of high density32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, G418 DNA-electroporated neural crest cells of the Hypeco nera (pigmented) strain of chicken are placed in culture, followed by enrichment of G418-resistant melanocyte precursors in melanocyte growth medium (Fig 4f; see Material and Methods)32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, these cells are transplanted into a host embryo of White leghorn (unpigmented), where the Hypeco nera-derived cells populate and behave as normal melanocytes32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we electroporated pT2A-TRE-C3 (tet-inducible) and pT2A-CAGGS-TetOn3G-IRES-Neor (tet-non-inducible; TetOn3G encodes tet-dependent transcriptional activator) along with pCAGGS-T2TP (Tol2 transposase) into Hypeco nera embryos (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the enrichment of G418r-melanocyte precursors in culture and a transplantation of these cells into a host embryo of White leghorn, Dox was administered at E10, and the embryos were assessed for pigmentation at E12 (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of melanin particles per 1mm2 of control EGFP-expressing skin area was 2,211 +/ 290 (n=14), whereas that of C3 was 1,545 +/ 129 (Fig 4G; n=11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, we conclude that the membrane vesicle release from the melanocytes contributes profoundly to the skin pigmentation, and also that the melanosome transfer to keratinocytes is mediated, at least in part, by membrane vesicle protrusion and its release in the chicken embryo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have demonstrated that the melanosome transfer in the chicken 3-D skin is mediated, at least in part, by plasma membrane vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melanosome-containing vesicles are discharged from a melanocyte into extracellular spaces, and subsequently engulfed by neighboring keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are consistent with one of the three prevailing models proposed by in vitro studies6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21 (See also Introduction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, our study does not exclude the other models of cytophagocytosis- and exocytosis-mediated transfer6,7,8,10,11,15,21, and it is indeed underway to see if melanocytes in different locations of the body send their melanosomes in a different way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also demonstrated that differentiating melanocytes undergo blebbing of the plasma membrane prior to the vesicle release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the melanosome-encapsulated blebs are pinched off to become vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have finally shown that RhoA plays important roles in both the membrane blebbing and vesicle release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the membrane vesicle-mediated transfer of melanosome is a consequence of multiple steps during melanocyte differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The delineation of these steps has been enabled by high amenability of chicken embryos, in which melanocyte precursors/neural crest cells can specifically be gene-manipulated in 3-D environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What triggers the melanosome encapsulation in the membrane vesicles?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since more than half of discharged vesicles are vacant (Fig 3e), it is likely that the melanosome encapsulation is a stochastic event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas no vesicles contain multiple melanosomes, numerous melanosomes are recognized in a single keratinocyte, implying that these melanosomes might derive from different vesicles and from different melanocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we have observed GFP-labeled and unlabeled vesicles in a single keratinocyte (Supplementary video 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, it is conceivable that melanosomes produced by a single melanocyte are delivered to multiple keratinocytes, thus enabling a wide coverage of the skin with melanin particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the membrane vesicle-mediated transfer plays a significant role in the skin pigmentation since inhibition of the vesicle production results in a reduced amount of membrane blebbing and pigmentation in the body skin (Fig 4f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membrane vesicle-mediated transfer of melanosomes that we have described in this study appears to be distinct from that reported by Wu et al., who showed that relatively large vesicles are pinched off in which multiple melanosomes are packed18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that different mechanisms exist in the body for the production of membrane vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-resolution live imaging analyses combined with membrane-tethered EGFP labeling of melanocyte precursors have revealed that the membrane blebbing precedes the vesicle production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the vesicles are the product of these blebs, the blebbing must be requisite for the membrane vesicle-mediated melanosome transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane blebbing has not been reported by previous studies using in vitro cultured melanocytes, raising the possibility that the membrane dynamics of melanocytes might be regulated by 3-D environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also observed that the plasma membrane of discharged vesicles exhibit a phosphatidylserine-enriched outer layer, the well known eat me signal recognized by neighboring cells shown in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (Fig 3f)39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that this flipped localization of phosphatidylserine already occurs in the blebbing plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the membrane blebbing and vesicle release have been reported for platelets and several invasive cancer cells40,41,42, one can speculate that the membrane vesicle-mediated intercellular communications might take place in broader types of cells than previously thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relevant to this, melanoma cells have been reported to produce protease-containing membrane vesicles that might be used to degrade extracellular matrices for their metastasis43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is conceivable that the membrane vesicles produced by melanocytes (this study) might also serve as a vehicle to convey not only a melanosome but also other substances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exosomes (particles smaller in size than the membrane vesicle) produced by some cancer cells contain signal substances such as microRNAs, and are delivered to a long-distance target44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another important finding obtained in this study is that RhoA activity is critical for both the membrane blebbing and vesicle release in maturing melanocytes revealed by temporally controlled knockdown experiments (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is widely accepted that Rho and Rac activities counteract each other in a variety of intracellular events45,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that RhoA activity might be localized to the blebbing site whereas the rest of plasma membrane maintains its integrity by Rac activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion is consistent with the previous study that Rac1 is important for the dendrite formation in melanocytes48, and also with our finding that the inhibition of RhoA in E9 melanocytes resulted not only in the reduction of blebbing but also in promoting filopodia (Supplementary Figure S4, and Supplementary Video 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The regulation of skin pigmentation is critical not only for protection against solar radiation, but also for camouflage and individual identification leading to survival and reproductive strategies in a wide variety of animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, particularly, the pigmentation is an important cosmetic concern in numerous syndromes involving depigmentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the melanocytes in chickens are seen both in between and around feather buds, and this pattern of distribution is similar to humans, but not to mice where melanocytes are restricted to hair follicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular and cellular mechanisms unveiled in this study will open the way to further investigations into how the skin pigmentation emerged during animal evolution, and may also ultimately have important consequences for medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Enrichment of gene-introduced melanocytes: A dorsal skin was dissected from E9 embryos using micro-scissors, and treated with 0.25% (v/v) trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for 30min at 38.5°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A suspension of dissociate cells was placed in PrimariaTM 60mm cell culture dishes (BD Biosciences) coated with 50g/ml recombinant fibronectin (Wako) according to the optimized culture condition for melanocytes50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One day after incubation, melanocytes were fed with Mel-mix medium containing 10ng/ml 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, Wako) and 500g/ml G418 (Wako) to select melanocytes expressing Tet3G and Neor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fresh Mel-mix medium containing TPA and G418 was added to culture every 3 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells were cultured at 38.5°C at 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The procedures were also described previously32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transplantation of cultured melanocytes into White leghorn embryos: Cell aggregates of melanocytes were prepared with the hanging drop method51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melanocytes-containing medium (8l) was dropped on the lid of petri dish (BD Biosciences), and DMEM was placed in the bottom of counterpart dish to keep moist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drops were incubated for 2448hours in an incubator supplied with 5% CO2, 38.5°C, until a cell aggregate formed at the tip of the drop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the transplantation, an epidermal ectoderm at the 20th to 25th somite level of White leghorn embryos was incised using a sharpened tungsten needle, and a melanocyte aggregate was placed into the incision using a glass needle as previously described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treated embryos were re-incubated until E10 when a Dox solution was administered, followed by re-incubation until E12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melanin particles in these specimens were observed by the confocal microscope NikonA1R, and quantified by Nikon software Nis-elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
