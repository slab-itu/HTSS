Temporary-tattoo for long-term high fidelity biopotential recordings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electromyography is a non-invasive method widely used to map muscle activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For decades, it was commonly accepted that dry metallic electrodes establish poor electrode-skin contact, making them impractical for skin electromyography applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gelled electrodes are therefore the standard in electromyography with their use confined, almost entirely, to laboratory settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present novel dry electrodes, exhibiting outstanding electromyography recording along with excellent user comfort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrodes were realized using screen-printing of carbon ink on a soft support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conformity of the electrodes helps establish direct contact with the skin, making the use of a gel superfluous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma polymerized 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene was used to enhance the impedance of the electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed an increase in electrode capacitance by a factor of up to 100 in wet conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impedance measurements show a reduction factor of 10 in electrode impedance on human skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suitability of the electrodes for long-term electromyography recordings from the hand and from the face is demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presented electrodes are ideally-suited for many applications, such as brain-machine interfacing, muscle diagnostics, post-injury rehabilitation, and gaming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Skin electrodes are a common, non-invasive tool used to record electrical activity from the surface of the body (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG) and electrocardiography (ECG))1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface EMG (sEMG), in particular, has been suggested for a wide range of applications, such as brain-machine interfacing5,6, speech detection7 and recording emotions8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that sEMG can quantify and report elementary emotions exceeding the reliability of self-reporting and image analysis9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By identifying specific muscle activation, facial sEMG can even discriminate between mood states, including Duchenne (genuine) and non-Duchenne (fake) smiles8,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the clear motivation to use sEMG in clinical and daily activities, long-term and multi-site recording remains a challenge, particularly because of poor signal transmission at the electrode-skin interface12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traditional electrodes require skin preparation (wiping and abrasion) and electrolytic gel application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These prerequisites are time consuming, demand a specialized technician, and are uncomfortable and possibly painful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, signal quality gradually degrades over time as the gel dries out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, dry, stable and easy to apply skin electrodes are highly desired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) on temporary tattoo film were reported for epidermal pH monitoring14, demonstrating its potential for long-term applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Screen-printing technology allows straightforward patterning of small electrodes with a wide range of inks (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gold, silver, and carbon)15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, it allows a great flexibility in substrate material (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  plastic sheets, cloth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, SPEs have been used primarily in the field of chemical sensing15,16 and bio-sensing14,17, with limited application in electrophysiological recordings18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thin film based devices19,20, and organic electrochemical transistors21 were also recently proposed for surface sensing applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we report the development of highly soft carbon SPEs, which can be placed on the skin for a long duration (hours) in a stable manner, with low electrode-skin impedance, even at low geometric areas22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impedance reduction is essential for high signal to noise ratio (SNR), high-resolution recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrode-skin impedance was improved by a plasma polymerized 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (ppEDOT) coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma polymerization was chosen as a simple, solvent-free, room temperature process23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, EDOT was selected owing to its biocompatibility and ionic conductivity25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate how the plasma polymerized film improves the electrode capacitance, yielding a capacitance comparable with that of state-of-the-art neuronal electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show multi-site sEMG recordings from the hand and face and demonstrate force and facial expression sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electrodes were realized following the scheme presented in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process builds on standard screen-printing, combined with laser cutting to make holes in a double-sided passivation layer, which also serves as a skin-adhesive material (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The array is placed on the skin and a conformal contact is achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows stable recordings even for small electrodes (20mm2; Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce the electrode impedance and to improve the electrical recording performances, we implemented a ppEDOT coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Figure 1c,d show typical sEMG recordings from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrows indicate the onset of the signal following a rest position (1), and application of force against the index finger, activating the FDI (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal amplitude is proportional to the force (discussed later).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, is a flexion of the index finger towards the thumb (isotonic contraction) (3), extension from the thumb (4), and finally pointing up (5) (see also Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multi-site recordings allow signal enhancement through an optimal choice of differential electrode pairs (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, electrodes located on two sides of the array obtained best results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrodes stability was verified by leaving it on the hand for an extended duration and repeating the recording under the same protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After three hours, recordings remained stable (Fig 1d), with a SNR value of 13 (22dB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No skin irritation was observed for five individuals for up to ten hours (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We characterized the plasma polymerization process, focusing on chemical and impedance spectroscopy analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemical structure, morphology and physical properties of the film depends on process conditions (power, monomer vapor pressure and deposition time)27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this study, a new process was developed to achieve maximal impedance reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first demonstrate the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of ppEDOT films (90W for 10min) deposited on glass substrates (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in sulfur and oxygen components from 0.05% to 0.32% and from 53.3% to 56.6% respectively indicates ppEDOT deposition (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atomic ratio of sulfur, as well as the concentration of C-S and S-O components, increased with process time and power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ppEDOT coated carbon SPEs were also tested (Fig 2c), revealing an increase in surface oxygen from 15.2% to 18.6%, indicating the formation of a film incorporating elements from the monomer, while not retaining the monomer chemical structure, was most likely due to fragmentation in the plasma environment28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the morphology of a ppEDOT/carbon SPE was compared to that of a pristine surface using scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coated and uncoated surfaces appeared similar, indicating an ultrathin coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For validating the biocompatibility of the coating, comparative in vitro cell survival tests were conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary neurons were cultured on glass coated with ppEDOT, and their survival was compared with that of cells seeded on a poly-D-lysine coating (a cell adhesion promoting protein), and on uncoated surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences were found in cell survival up to six days (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The electrochemical properties of pristine and ppEDOT SPEs were explored using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CV data (Fig 3a) revealed featureless curves for uncoated and coated electrodes as expected for carbon (the small oxidation peak at 0.1V is typical to carbon ink due to impurities).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current versus scan rate showed linear dependence (Supplementary Fig 3a) in accordance with a double layer capacitor model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DC capacitance was calculated and normalized with the electrode area (12mm2) to derive the specific capacitance (Cs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cs increased by two orders of magnitude from 0.018 to 1.6±0.1 and 3.3±0.2 mFcm2 for coated electrode (12 and 90W respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13 mFcm2 values are comparable with state of the art values of porous titanium nitride and carbon nanotube electrodes29 (with 210 mFcm2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impedance and phase data versus frequency of the coated electrodes in PBS is demonstrated in Fig 3b and in Supplementary Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrode impedance appears to stabilize, especially the carbon/ppEDOT, at moderate frequencies to a typical value reflecting the PBS impedance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The electrode-skin impedance of SPE and commercial electrodes were studied under similar conditions (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skin was abraded (and wiped) prior to positioning of all electrode types using a designated abrasive paste, as indicated in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that a more aggressive abrasion of the skin may lower the impedance, yet the gentle preparation used here is more suitable for facial and sensitive skin applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the skin preparation procedure was identical for both pregelled and dry electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 1kHz, coated electrodes have on average 10 times lower impedance than that of pristine electrodes, which in turn have about 10 times larger impedance than that of gelled electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since commercial electrodes have 15 times the area, it appears that their specific impedance is similar to that of dry ppEDOT/carbon electrodes (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear correlation between the impedance and the inverse of electrode surface area was validated by testing electrodes at different sizes (Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate the performances of the electrodes, we investigated two scenarios: long-term recording from the FDI (Fig 4a), and from the zygomaticus major (ZM) muscle of the face (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after placing the array, stable recordings were systematically obtained in all electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frequency analysis generated form the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of signals recorded with carbon/ppEDOT, and pregelled electrodes (Supplementary Fig 4c,d) illustrate similar frequency spectra, in accordance with the expected spectra for muscle activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Typical noise root mean square (RMS) levels were in the range of 83±20, 66±6 and 74±15  for carbon electrodes with a surface area of 20mm2, ppEDOT/carbon electrode array with a surface area of 20mm2 and commercial pre-gelled electrodes with a surface area of 300mm2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noise RMS levels of the differential signals were in the range of 26±11  for uncoated electrode array, 25±9  for the ppEDOT electrode array and 22±9  for the commercial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the high SNR, it was possible to record force sensitive data from the FDI at 0.20.5N with a calibrated spring (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, electrodes without ppEDOT were not sensitive enough to pick the 0.2N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recording from the face was performed to highlight the true strength of the tattoo array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZM, which pulls the corners of the mouth back and up into a smile, is particularly interesting for emotional expressions and bipolar subjective valence detection9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrays were placed on the cheek, above the ZM (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical recordings, following different facial expressions (Fig 4c), are shown in Fig 4d,e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A clear electrical response is observed while laughing and during a wide smile (Fig 4d), while a weaker response is measured during a sad expression (Fig 4e), demonstrating the capacity to differentiate between a smile (observed in 07 and 34 recordings), and a sad expression (observed only in 07 recording).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings from the face muscles were conducted on three individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signals presented in Fig 4d,e are typical results obtained from the same person.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar differentiation in response to different facial expressions was observed for both individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this paper novel dry electrodes for long-term sEMG recordings were described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small (down to 5mm in diameter) electrodes allow high SNR recording without the need for a gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a divergence from a long held view that asserted otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, many recent efforts to improve dry electrodes focused on skin penetration30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sEMG system described here suggests many benefits and uses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foremost, the electrodes are dry, avoiding the complications associated with electrolytic gel, such as skin irritation and gel drying that degrades long-term recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial-resolution allows easy electrode placement that simplifies the recording procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact position of nerves and muscles is no longer a challenge, and can be achieved through different electrode configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the integration with electronic devices and wireless capabilities is straightforward and can be implemented with off-the-shelf electronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A key advantage presented here is the use of screen-printing technology combined with a newly developed ppEDOT coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Screen-printing is cheap and can be readily implemented in large-scale production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, different materials can be conveniently implemented to support the integration of chemical sensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another challenge we addressed is the need for low-temperature and dry surface modification process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ppEDOT was found to enhance the specific capacitance of the SPEs and contributed to a reduction in noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Better understanding the mechanisms governing the electrode-skin impedance (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  carbon layer thickness, adhesive diameter, surface morphology, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  will allow further improving the electrodes towards better specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preliminary safety studies presented here reveal that ppEDOT electrodes cause no skin irritation and can be used for hours without discomfort (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While focusing on sEMG, other bio-signals, such as EEG, are likely to benefit from the proposed technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preliminary investigations reveal similar benefits in placing and recording performances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To conclude, by demonstrating sEMG recordings from the FDI and the face, we have revealed the potential of these electrodes for future applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FDI recording is attractive for brain-machine interfacing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the force applied by the index finger can be readily derived from the sEMG amplitude, sEMG data can be conveniently transformed into a simple communication platform, without the need for a mechanical device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By recording facial expressions, we demonstrated a new route towards recording emotions, opening up new opportunities in digitizing emotions for clinical and social purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fabrication_of_screen-printed_electrode_array  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The electrodes were fabricated using a pre-patterned mesh stencil (Sefar Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Printing was accomplished by a manual application of a conductive carbon ink (Conductive compounds) on a blank temporary tattoo paper (Papilio), which served as a substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was followed by curing at 130°C for 10min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrical conductivity of the carbon film is ~40 /.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A double-sided adhesive layer (Papilio) was used as a passivation layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A laser cutter (ELAS Ltd.) was used to define holes for the exposed electrode area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A two-step process was used to prevent overheating of the glue layer: (1) laser intensity of 400mW and removal of the passivation upper layer, followed by (2) intensity of 800mW and removal of the remaining two layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the adhesive passivation layer with pre-defined holes and the printed electrode were pressed together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mechanically support contact of the printed electrode array and a ZIF connector (Omnetics), a polyimide tape (Kapton, 3M) with pre-defined holes was added onto the array bonding pads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The holes in the Kapton film were cut with the same laser cutter with intensity of 400mW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plasma_polymerized_EDOT_coating  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EDOT (Sigma) was plasma polymerized using an RF plasma system (Pico-RF-PC, Diener electronics), operating at a frequency of 13.56MHz and a monomer vapor pressure of 0.1mbar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma power of either 12 or 90W for either 10 or 60min was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrochemical_characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CV and EIS were performed in PBS (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CV measurements were conducted using a potentiostat (263A, Princeton Applied Research) under ambient conditions, using a three-electrode cell configuration with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DC capacitance was calculated from the slope of the current versus the scan rate according to: , where i is the current, C is the DC capacitance and dV/dt is the scan rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EIS measurements were conducted under equilibrium conditions by applying 10mV AC signals using a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research Systems) and a potentiostat (263A, Princeton Applied Research).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SPE test samples (Dropsens) were used for electrochemical characterization in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrode-skin impedance was measured using an amplifier evaluation system (RHD2000, Intan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pregelled electrodes (Spes Medica) were used for testing (15 by 20mm) and as reference (35 by 45mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Surface_properties  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
XPS measurements were performed using a 5600 Multi-Technique System (Physical Electronics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural characterization of the printed electrode surface was performed using SEM (JEOL JSM-6700F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrophysiology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
sEMG recordings were performed using an Intan Technologies amplifier evaluation board (RHD2000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skin was cleaned (everi, Spesmedica) and dried prior to electrode placement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force calibration measurements were performed by applying a force against a calibrated spring using the index finger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noise RMS levels were calculated during the muscles relaxation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNR was calculated by dividing signal RMS levels (calculated over the period of activation) by noise RMS (2s window).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experiments_on_Human_Subjects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experiments on human skin were conducted on volunteers in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations under approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee Review Board at Tel Aviv University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
