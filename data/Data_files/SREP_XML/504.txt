RNA activation of haploinsufficient Foxg1 gene in murine neocortex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
More than one hundred distinct gene hemizygosities are specifically linked to epilepsy, mental retardation, autism, schizophrenia and neuro-degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radical repair of these gene deficits via genome engineering is hardly feasible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same applies to therapeutic stimulation of the spared allele by artificial transactivators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small activating RNAs (saRNAs) offer an alternative, appealing approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a proof-of-principle, here we tested this approach on the Rett syndrome-linked, haploinsufficient, Foxg1 brain patterning gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected a set of artificial small activating RNAs (saRNAs) upregulating it in neocortical precursors and their derivatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of these effectors achieved a robust biological outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  saRNA-driven activation (RNAa) was limited to neural cells which normally express Foxg1 and did not hide endogenous gene tuning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  saRNAs recognized target chromatin through a ncRNA stemming from it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene upregulation required Ago1 and was associated to RNApolII enrichment throughout the Foxg1 locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, saRNA delivery to murine neonatal brain replicated Foxg1-RNAa in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
More than one hundred different hemizygous gene deletions underlie a variety of neuropathological conditions, leading to epilepsy, mental retardation, autism, schizophrenia and neurodegeneration1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their individual prevalence is low, however their cumulative frequency makes them an issue for social health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A scalable therapeutic approach is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How to achieve this goal?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of defective genes, triggered by Engineered EndoNucleases (EEN) and driven by a dedicated editor DNA, should be the golden procedure to fix the problem6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reality, the implementation of this approach within the CNS would be hardly feasible, due to a variety of technical issues9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more spartan design, based on therapeutic minigenes, would be problematic as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the exact rescue of gene expression levels is often needed for proper execution of neural gene functions12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the faithful recapitulation of the gene expression pattern generally requires a number of properly arranged cis-active elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clustering all of them into a small transgene, suitable for panneural delivery, can be hardly feasible and/or scalable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a different approach is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be a gentle stimulation of the spared gene allele, still under the control of the regulatory elements which shape its baseline expression profile and mediate subtle modulation of its levels linked to neuronal physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nowadays, two classes of molecular tools are potentially available for this last approach: (a) artificial transcription factors, and (b) small activating RNAs (saRNAs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former ones include Zinc finger- (ZF-)15,16,17,18,19, TransActivator Like Element- (TALE-)20,21,22, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-23,24,25,26,27,28 and NMHV-type29 transactivators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite their capability to stimulate endogenous genes ad libitum, their employment for therapy of neural haploinsufficiencies may be problematic, because of their very large size30 and ectopic gene activation26,27,28,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  saRNAs, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miRNA/siRNA-like molecules targeting the surroundings of the transcription unit in order, may also stimulate transcription, upon delivery as mature moieties, pri-miRNA- or shRNA precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, they work as effectors of RNA(-dependent gene) activation (RNAa)32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the initial RNAa report by Li et al.35, several genes were transactivated by saRNAs32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the intricate and heterogenous epigenetic changes evoked by these effectors36, their ultimate functional outcome seems to be basically attributable to two distinct molecular mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  saRNAs can act by destabilizing ncRNAs which normally dampen mRNA transcritpion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, they can convey the transcriptional machinery to chromatin37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, moderate power and small size of saRNAs make them a promising tool for treatment of neural haploinsufficiencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However their biological effectiveness, selectivity and compliance with endogenous gene tuning still wait for in depth characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a proof-of-principle, here we employed RNAa to stimulate the haploinsufficient Foxg1 transcription factor gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foxg1 is a key regulator of cortico-cerebral development and function, implicated in pallial field specification39, precursors proliferation control40,41 and laminar42 as well as areal43 neuronal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, its allele dosage is crucial to neurological health, as hemideletion and duplication of Foxg1 lead to Rett and West syndromes, respectively44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we found that RNAa resulted into a Foxg1 expression gain suitable for therapeutic purposes and led to an appreciable biological outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No ectopic gene activation occurred and endogenous gene tuning was preserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a robust Foxg1 stimulation was also achieved in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selecting_miRNA-like_saRNAs_upregulating_Foxg1-mRNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order to identify potential genomic targets appropriate for Foxg1-RNAa, we inspected the 5 surroundings of NCBI-RefSeq Foxg1-mRNA transcriptional start sites (TSSs) for sequences specifically amenable to miRNA targeting, via the pri-miRNA-155-based Block-It platform45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected eight high-score candidates (Fig 1A and Supplementary Table 1) and we cloned the cDNAs, encoding for the corresponding precursors, into the lentiviral constitutive expressor pLVmiR.2345 (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acutely delivered the resulting lentiviruses to murine E12.5 neocortical precursors, we kept these cells as floating neurospheres in pro-proliferative medium for four days and we eventually scored them for Foxg1-mRNA levels by qRTPCR (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 8 out of 8 miRNAs, 4 antisense-oriented (miR-Foxg1.0650, miR-Foxg1.1653, miR-Foxg1.2764 and miR-Foxg1.3700) and 4 sense-oriented (miR-Foxg1.0755, miR-Foxg1.1694, miR-Foxg1.2273 and miR-Foxg1.3795), upregulated Foxg1, to different extents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression gain ranged from 1.28±0.24-folds (miR-Foxg1.2764) to 2.88±0.34-folds (miR-Foxg1.0650) (Fig 1E and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were achieved upon delivery of miR-Foxg1.0650 and miR-Foxg1.1694 to NIH3T3 and HEK293T cells, which led to a consistent increase of Foxg1/FOXG1 proteins (Fig S1 and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we wondered if Foxg1-RNAa may be also achieved in differentiating derivatives of neocortical precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We transferred the pri-miRNA-cDNAs of the four best-performing miRNAs (Fig 1E) into LV_TREt-IRES2EGFP46, inbetween the doxycyclin-controlled TREt promoter and an IRES2EGFP reporter gene (Fig 1B,(b2)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed the resulting lentiviruses - paired to a constitutive rtTA2S-M2 transactivator expressor, LV_Pgk1p-rtTA2S-M246 (Fig 1B,(b1)), to drive delayed, TetON-controlled miRNA expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, we found that only one miRNA (miR-Foxg1.1694) upregulated Foxg1, by 1.56±0.11-folds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other ones were uneffective (Fig 1F and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, to corroborate the significance of these results, we tested if the small expression gain elicited by our saRNAs led to an appreciable biological readout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we stimulated Foxg1 by miR-Foxg1.0650 and .1694 in proliferating murine neocortical precursors (Fig 2A,B) and we evaluated the impact of this manipulation on the generation of postmitotic, Tub3+ neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foxg1 - in fact - inhibits the exit of neuronogenic precursors from cell cycle40,41 and even a small increase of its expression level is known to exert a deep impact on neuronogenic differentiation rates29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, both miRNAs halved the neuronal output of the culture, in a highly reproducible fashion (Fig 2C,D and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Compliance_of_RNAa_with_endogenous_tuning_of_Foxg1-mRNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The therapeutic exploitation of RNAa for the treatment of haplo-insufficiencies would be easier if the activity of saRNAs would be confined to cells normally expressing the gene in order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the fulfilment of this requirement, we delivered miR-Foxg1.0650 and .1694 to proliferating neural precursors originating from the murine E10.5 meso-rhombo-cervical neural domain, which does not express Foxg147.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed neural precursors dissected out of the E12.5 neocortex as histogenetically-equivalent positive controls (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, albeit weakly upregulated by miR-Foxg1.0650 and .1694, Foxg1 levels remained about 3 orders of magnitude lower in meso-rhombo-cervical derivatives, compared to neocortical controls (Fig 3B,C and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that risks of ectopic gene activation upon RNAa can be negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neuronal genes often undergo fine, electrical activity-related tuning, which may be crucial to proper implementation of their function48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An acceptable therapy of neuropathogenic haploinsufficiencies relying on stimulation of the spared gene allele should take into account such physiological gene modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure of neocortical neurons to high extracellular [K+] was followed by a prompt arousal of Foxg1-mRNA levels (Fig 3D,E and Supplementary Table 2), a likely in vitro correlate of activity-dependent Foxg1 stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that this phenomenon might provide a valuable opportunity for probing compliance of RNAa with endogenous gene tuning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the delivery of miR-Foxg1.1694 to K+-challenged neocortical neurons elicited a delicate upward shift of the Foxg1 activation curve under high extracellular [K+].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ANCOVA analysis of data provided no evidences of interaction between K+ stimulation and RNAa (Fig 3E), suggesting that RNAa does not hide activity-driven Foxg1 tuning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_mechanisms_underlying_Foxg1-RNAa  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNAa is supposed to be a heterogeneous process and at least two classes of molecular mechanisms are supposed to underlie it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAa may take place via downregulation of ncRNAs which limit transcription of the associated gene of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, saRNAs may drive molecular machinery promoting transcription to target chromatin37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To cast light on this issue, we monitored expression levels of the Foxg1-associated, sense-oriented AK158887 ncRNA (Fig 4A), following the delivery of antisense-oriented, miR-Foxg1.0650 and miR-Foxg1.1653.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No down-regulation of AK158887 was found, suggesting that, at least in these cases, the latter mechanism may apply (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As for recognition of target chromatin, saRNAs might straightly bind to unwound chromosomal DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, they might pair to nascent RNA molecules stemming from it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish between these possibilities, we downregulated the putative miR-Foxg1.0650 target AK158887 RNA, by gapmer-AK158887-1.1 in easily transfectable NIH/3T3 cells Fig 4A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, such manipulation fully abolished miR-Foxg1.0650-dependent Foxg1 transactivation (Fig 4B), while not affecting Foxg1 levels in miRNA-NC-treated samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that miR-Foxg1.0650 recognizes its chromatin target via RNA/RNA pairing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both Ago1 and Ago2 are detectable in the nucleus and can bind miRNAs49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ago2 was also specifically implicated in a number of RNAa cases, possibly acting as a bridge between the saRNA and the supramolecular transactivating complex50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the involvement of Ago2 in Foxg1-RNAa, we evaluated its recruitment to miR-Foxg1.0650 and .1694 target sequences, upon saRNA delivery to neocortical precursors, by ChIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enrichment for Ago1 was monitored as a specificity control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, both saRNAs increased the recruitment of Ago1, but not of Ago2 (Fig 4C,D), pointing to a selective involvement of the former in Foxg1-RNAa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To corroborate this inference, we antagonized Ago1 translation by a dedicated morpholino in NIH/3T3 cells (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, this treatment suppressed miR-Foxg1.1694-dependent Foxg1 transactivation (Fig 4E), while not affecting Foxg1 levels in miRNA-NC-treated samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All this confirms the pivotal role of Ago1 in Foxg1-RNAa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further explore mechanisms leading to RNAa, we monitored the enrichment of the Foxg1 locus for RNApolII, upon saRNA delivery to neural precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that both miR-Foxg1.0650 and 0.1694 robustly increased RNApolII recruitment along the entire locus (Figs 4A,F,G and Supplementary Table 2), which likely led to augmented transcription rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the absolute RNApolII recruitment profile did not display any sudden decrease downstrem of Foxg1-TSS in control conditions (Fig 4A and S3, and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, no abrupt increase of RNApolII recruitment took place in the same position upon saRNA delivery (Fig 4A,F,G, and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether these data suggest that RNApolII does not normally pause near Foxg1-TSS and saRNAs stimulate Foxg1 transcription by promoting RNApolII recruitment to TSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_vivo_Foxg1-RNAa  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although highly flexible and powerful for analytical purposes, lentiviral vectors employed throughout this study would pose obvious concerns for in vivo exploitation, due to their insertional mutagenesis activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, we could circumvent this issue replacing lentivirus-encoded saRNAs by their synthetic siRNA-like analogues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To preliminarily explore this possibility, we delivered siRNA-Foxg1.1694 (a synthetic analogue of miR-Foxg1.1694) or the siRNA-GFP control to murine neocortical differentiating derivatives, by Lipofectamine-RNAimax transfectant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, siRNA-Foxg1.1694 specifically upregulated Foxg1-mRNA, by 1.47±0.02-folds (Fig S4A,B and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encouraged by this result, we repeated this in vitro assay, replacing the commercial transfectant by the Chimeric Rabies Virus Glycoprotein Fragment (RVG-R9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This polypeptide may be easily loaded with nucleic acids, it crosses the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and targets the vast majority of CNS cells via a specific interaction with the 7 chain of the nicotinic receptor51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, it is a promising tool for therapeutic brain targeting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, RVG-R9-mediated siRNA-Foxg1.1694 transfection replicated Foxg1-mRNA upregulation obtained by RNAimax (Fig S4C,D and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the documented expression of 7 in proliferating neocortical precursors52, we tested if the RVG-R9/siRNA-Foxg1.1694 complex might upregulate Foxg1 even in neurospheres originating from E12.5 cortical tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, the huge upregulation detected (almost 9-folds) was not specific, since it was also achieved by the RVG-R9/siRNA-GFP control complex (Fig S4E,F and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even worse, such upregulation was associated to massive differentiation of proliferating precursors to postmitotic neurons (Fig S4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in vivo employment of RVG-R9 might lead to a detrimental precocious exhaustion of neuronogenic niches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of that, we considered an alternative delivery tool for our saRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We chose to administer miR-Foxg1.1694 to the living brain through AAV9-pseudotyped, self-complementary AAV2-derivative, adeno-associated viral vectors, under the control of a constitutive promoter (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We injected 3*1010 infecting particles into the right lateral ventricle of P0 mouse pups by free hands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sacrificed these animals three weeks later (P21) and scored their right neocortices for Foxg1-mRNA content as well as for the frequency at which Foxg1+ cells were AAV-transduced (Fig 5B,C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, Foxg1 was upregulated by 1.66±0.30 folds (Fig 5D and Supplementary Table 2), even though the transduction frequency of Foxg1+ cells was only 0.17±0.01 (Fig 5E,F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Active in telencephalic precursors and their postmitotic derivatives, the brain patterning gene Foxg1 controls a variety of neurodevelopmental and physiological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its allele dosage is crucial, since its duplication and deletion result in West and Rett-like syndromes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a proof-of-principle of RNAa therapy of Foxg1 haploinsufficiency, here we selected 8 artificial saRNAs upregulating Foxg1 in neocortical precursors, 1 of which worked in their postmitotic derivatives too (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of these saRNAs elicited an appreciable biological outcome (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAa was restricted to neural cells expressing the target gene and did not interfere with its endogenous tuning (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  saRNAs recognized their target chromatin through nascent ncRNAs and recruited RNApolII to it, possibly via Ago1 (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, delivery of one saRNA to mouse neonates, by intraventricular injection of recombinant AAV vectors, replicated Foxg1-RNAa in vivo (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, only one out of the best four miRNAs activating Foxg1 in proliferating neocortical precursors worked satisfactorily in their postmitotic derivatives (Fig 1A,E,F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be due to the different epigenetic state of chromatin, generally more accessible in the former ones53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may specifically reflect a different ncRNA landscape at the Foxg1 locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the moderate amplitude of Foxg1-upregulation achieved by RNAa, such manipulation elicited a pronounced histogenetic effect (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was not a surprise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high sensitivity of neuronogenic rates to even subtle changes of Foxg1 levels was already reported29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, similar phenomena were described for a number of other patterning genes, including Emx2 and Pax645,55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also found that the saRNAs achieved a relevant molecular outcome only in primary cultures where the gene of interest was active (Fig 3AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that therapeutic saRNA delivery, driven by a ubiquitous promoter or achieved via straight administration of pre-made, synthetic molecules, should be followed by the activation of the target gene limited to its standard expression domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, within responsive neurons, saRNAs elicited a gentle and reproducible stimulation of the gene in order, which did not interfere with its fine endogenous tuning (Fig 3D,E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All that strenghtens the saRNA suitability for precise and affordable treatment of haploinsufficiences, with special emphasis on those of neurological interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Concerning mechanisms of RNAa, the employment of gapmers against ncRNAs stemming from the target locus is an elegant method for unveiling its molecular logic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, if the gapmer reproduces the saRNA effect, then gene activation should originate from destabilization of its ncRNA target, as described for Bdnf by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the gapmer suppresses saRNA activity - as reported for PR and COX2 by refs 38 and 50 - then RNAa should rather rely on the recruitment of transactivating effectors to the target locus, via ncRNA docks stemming from it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter scenario is what we observed for Foxg1 upon delivery of miR-Foxg1.0650 (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other antisense saRNAs stimulating this gene might work in a similar way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sense-oriented saRNAs might land on not yet mapped, Foxg1-associated antisense-ncRNAs, or act according to a different molecular logic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beyond target chromatin recognition by saRNAs, a crucial role in RNAa is played by Argonautes, which act as adaptors between the chromatin-bound saRNAs and the effector complex stimulating transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a number of cases, Ago2 was reported to be the key player.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It binds the target gene through saRNAs, it mediates the assembly of a supramolecular dock for RNApolII, and it is ultimately necessary for RNAa35,50,58,59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ago1 binds to TSS surroundings too.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it interacts with RNApolII and is involved in transcription regulation49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, initial reports implicated it in transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) rather than RNAa35,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, we found that suppressing Ago1 by morpholino abolished Foxg1-RNAa (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon is consistent with the recruitment of Ago1 to the Foxg1 promoter, triggered by saRNAs (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It echoes the recent report of Ago1-dependent RNAa at the IL2 locus61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A step further along the RNAa cascade, RNApolII is recruited to TSS49,58,59,62,63,64 or possibly stimulated to progress downstream of it65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of Foxg1-mRNA, the RNApolII enrichement profile of the gene, in baseline conditions as well as upon miR-Foxg1.0650 and .1694 delivery (Figs S3 and 4F,G), suggests that the former mechanism applies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
miR-Foxg1.1694 worked also in vivo (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the cumulative Foxg1 expression gain was about +68%, albeit only 1/6 of Foxg1-expressing cells were targeted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that the actual expression gain in targeted Foxg1+ cells might be not far from 6*68%, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  about +400%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that, in a therapeutic scenario, saRNA expression should be dampened to restore physiological Foxg1-mRNA expression levels, possibly via a weaker promoter or a tunable transactivating system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the employment of more advanced AAV drivers66 might help targeting the almost totality of telencephalic neural cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have selected a set of artificial miRNA eliciting a gentle Foxg1 transactivation, specifically in cortico-cerebral cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their delivery led to an appreciable biological outcome, while complying with endogenous gene tuning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They stimulated RNApolII recruitment, possibly via Ago1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these miRNAs worked promisingly in vivo, even though its therapeutic employment still requires further optimization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As recently shown, hemizygosity for specific genes and polygenic chromosomal segments underlies a huge number of neuropathological entitites1,2,3,4,5, for which no cure are presently available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on results reported above, RNAa might be a simple and scalable approach for fixing this class of problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animal_handling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wild-type, CD1 strain mice used in this study were purchased from Envigo-Italy and housed at the SISSA mouse facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals handling and subsequent procedures were in accordance with European [European Communities Council Directive of November 24, 1986 (86/609/EEC)] and Italian laws (D.L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  04.03.2014, n°26) and were approved by SISSA Board for Animal Welfare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryos were staged by timed breeding and vaginal plug inspection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neonates were staged as P0 on their birthday.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_cultures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Embryos (E10.5, E12.5 and E16.5) were harvested from pregnant dams killed by cervical dislocation and put in sterile ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.6% glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cerebral cortices (E12.5 and E16.5), mesencephalons (E10.5) and rhombocervical tracts (E10.5) were then dissected and collected in the same solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
E12.5 cerebral cortices as well as E10.5 mesencephalons and rhombo-cervical tracts were mechanically dissociated to single cells by gentle pipetting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neural precursor cells were subsequently counted in a Burker chamber and plated in 24-multiwell plates (Falcon), at the density of 1,000 cells/l, in proliferative medium [DMEM-F12 (Gibco), 1X Glutamax (Gibco), 1X N2 (Invitrogen), 1mg/ml BSA, 0.6% glucose, 2g/ml heparin (Stem Cell Technologies), 20ng/ml bFGF (Invitrogen), 20ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen), 1X Pen- Strept (Gibco), 10pg/ml Fungizone (Gibco)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neural precursors were acutely infected by recombinant lentiviruses and kept in culture up to 96h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiplicities of infection (mois) are reported in the corresponding figures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cortical tissue from E16.5 mice was chopped to small pieces for 5minutes, in the smallest volume of ice-cold 1X PBS-0,6% glucose-1mg/ml DNaseI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minced tissue was then resuspended and digested in 0.25mg/ml trypsin-1mg/ml DNAseI for 5minutes at 37°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Digestion was stopped by adding 1.5 volumes of DMEM/F12/10%FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cortical tissue was spinned down and transferred to differentiative medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suspension was pipetted 58 times with a P1000 Gilson pipette and undissociated tissue was left to sediment for 12minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was harvested and the living cells counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1×10^6 cells/well were plated on poly-L-Lysine coated 12 multiwell plates, in 600l of differentiative medium [Neurobasal-A (Gibco), 1X Glutamax (Gibco), 1X B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 25M L-glutamate, 25M -Mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 2% FBS, 1X Pen/Strept (Gibco), 10pg/ml Fungizone (Gibco)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociated neural cells were infected 24hours later and kept in culture up to 7 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiplicities of infection (mois) are reported in the corresponding figures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When required, doxycycline was added to the culture medium, at 2g/ml.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Medium was half-replaced with fresh one every 3.5 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were cultured in DMEM-GlutamaxTM (Gibco)-10% FBS, at 125,000 and 25,000 cells/cm2, respectively, according to standard protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lentiviral transductions were performed at mois reported in the corresponding figures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When appropriate, Ago1 and GFP morpholinos (GeneTools) were delivered to NIH/3T3 cells at 10M, by 6M EndoPorterTM carrier (GeneTools), according to manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When appropriate, AK158887-1.1 or control Antisense LNA GapmeRs (Exiqon) were delivered to cells at 50nM, by Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (TermoFisher), according to manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
