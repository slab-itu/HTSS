Identification of cardiac hemo-vascular precursors and their requirement of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 for heart development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cardiac endothelium plays a crucial role in the development of a functional heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the precise identification of the endocardial precursors and the mechanisms they require for their role in heart morphogenesis are not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using in vivo and in vitro cell fate tracing concomitant with specific cell ablation and embryonic heart transplantation studies, we identified a unique set of precursors which possess hemogenic functions and express the stem cell leukemia (SCL) gene driven by its 5 enhancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These hemo-vascular precursors give rise to the endocardium, atrioventricular cushions and coronary vascular endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, deletion of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) in these precursors leads to ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, a poorly understood condition leading to heart failure and early mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we identified a distinctive population of hemo-vascular precursors which require S1P1 to exert their functions and are essential for cardiac morphogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite its critical role in heart development, the origin of the cardiac endothelium remains intricate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the heart possesses two different types of endothelium: the endocardium, a structurally and functionally specialized endothelium, which may originate from both vascular endothelium and multipotent cardiac progenitors1, and the coronary vascular endothelial cells (CVECs) that seem to develop from endocardium, sinus venous endothelial cells (SVECs) and pro-epicardial precursors2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, some of these progenitors may possess important hemogenic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, blood islands thought to derive in situ from hemogenic endothelium have been found in the sub-epicardium and out flow tract endothelium of the embryonic heart4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another study has shown that Nkx2.5+ endocardium contributes to transient definitive hematopoiesis in the early embryonic heart6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data support the notion that both endocardium and CVECs may have hemogenic functions during early development and open the possibility that the early embryonic heart may undergo hemo-vasculogenesis, a process whereby the formation of a new blood vessel occurs simultaneously with the generation of blood precursors7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the origin of the hemogenic endocardium and CVECs is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stem cell leukemia (SCL/Tal1) gene encodes for a helix-loop-helix transcription factor required for the development of hemangioblasts, the putative common precursor of blood cells and endothelium8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SCL/Tal1 possesses two tissue specific enhancers that direct gene expression either to endothelium or to hematopoietic precursors9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fate tracing studies in zebra fish and expression analysis in mice showed that the SCL gene is expressed in early endocardial precursors and regulates endocardial/myocardial specification and migration of endocardial cells10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using mice with tamoxifen inducible cre recombinase expression driven by either enhancer13,14, we recently identified in the early embryonic kidney a SCL+ precursor that gives rise to both vascular endothelium and blood cells and requires sphingosine-1-phophate receptor 1 (S1P1) for the development of a normal renal vasculature15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sphingosine-1-phophate is a bioactive sphingolipid that regulates cell proliferation, migration and stabilization through activation of one of five G protein coupled receptors (S1P1- S1P5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During heart development, S1P1 is predominantly expressed in the endocardium, cardiomyocytes and vascular ECs from E8.5, before it is expressed in the vasculature of the head and body which starts at E10.516,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global knockout of S1P1 in the mouse leads to early embryonic lethality due to vascular abnormalities and impaired heart development17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous cardiac cell types respond to the S1P-S1P1 signaling pathway, however, the specific role of S1P1 in each cell type has not been fully examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study showed that deletion of S1P1 from cardiomyocytes leads to decreased number of cardiomyocytes in the ventricular compact layer19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, while investigating the role of S1P1 in the development of the kidney vasculature we found that deletion of S1P1 in SCL+ precursors led to bradycardia, suggesting an indispensable role of S1P1 in SCL+ progenitors during heart development15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in those studies the deletion of S1P1 was timed to study the developing kidney, which in the mouse starts to form 3 days later than the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the contribution of SCL+ precursors to heart morphogenesis and the role of endothelial S1P1 in heart development could not be fully assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using in vivo and in vitro genetic lineage tracings, colony forming assays and a novel crosstransplantation method combined with the inducible and highly specific ablation of SCL+ precursors, we tested the hypothesis that those precursors are necessary and require S1P1 for cardiac morphogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results show that SCL expression driven by its 5 end endothelial enhancer (SCLEC) labels cardiac hemo-vascular precursors that give rise to both endocardium and CVECs, a subset of which possesses hemogenic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial and complete ablation of these precursors led to growth retardation, cardiac hypotrophy and loss of endocardium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we induced early deletion (E7.5) of S1P1 from SCLEC+ precursors and their progeny in mice, which developed non-compaction of both ventricles and abnormal coronary vessels, suggesting an indispensible role of endothelial S1P1 for heart development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To investigate the presence and fate of SCLEC+ precursors in the developing heart, first we crossed EC-SCL-Cre-ERT+/ mice to R26mTmG/mTmG mice to obtain EC-SCL-Cre-ERT+/;R26mTmG/+ embryos, and performed a single maternal injection of tamoxifen to pregnant mice at embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5), when the cardiac crescent starts to form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1a shows histological analysis of embryos from E9.5 to E13.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At E9.5, GFP reporter expression labeled the endocardium of the outflow tract, ventricles and atria but not the myocardium (Fig 1b and c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At E10.5, GFP labeled the endocardium and the atrioventricular cushions (AVC), which subsequently undergo endothelial-mesenchymal transformation to form the future valves and septa (Fig 1d and e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From E12.5 to E13.5, GFP expression expanded in the developing endocardium, AVC and coronary vascular endothelial cells (CVECs), and appeared within the ventricular septum (Fig 1fi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further, double immunofluorescence staining for GFP and the endothelial marker PECAM-1 demonstrated that the endocardium (Fig 1g) and the majority of CVEC (Fig 1jo) co-expressed GFP and PECAM-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, a small population of CVECs and most of the aortic ECs were not labeled by GFP expression (Fig 1h and mo), which may due to either escaping tamoxifen induction or a distinct origin from non SCLEC+ precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we identified GFP+ PECAM-1- cells, which form vascular plexuses in the myocardium (Fig 1jl) and 55% of blood-islands co-expressing GFP and hemoglobin (Hb) in the atrioventricular groove (Fig 1p,q), indicating the immaturity and high mobility of these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the SCLEC+ precursors give rise to endocardium, AVC and the majority of CVECs and blood precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Embryonic_cardiac_progenitors_possess_hemogenic_potential  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the presence of erythroid progenitors in the early embryonic heart, first we crossed ER-GFP-Cre mice20, harboring a GFPcre knockin into the erythropoietin receptor locus, to R26YFP/YFP and R26mTmG/mTmG reporter mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro methylcellulose based colony forming unit assays using cells from E12.5 embryonic hearts and livers of ER-GFP-Cre;R26YFP/YFP mice showed that cells from these organs formed two types of early stage HSC colonies: CFU-GEMM colonies, containing granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes/macrophages and megakaryocytes and CFU-GM colonies, containing granulocytes and macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among those colonies, the YFP reporter was only found homogeneously expressed in 35% of the CFU-GEMM colonies derived from heart cells (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated the existence of at least two different early hematopoietic precursors within the embryonic heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further assess the hemogenic capacity of the embryonic heart we transplanted E9.5 hearts (n=10) from ER-GFP-Cre;R26mTmG mice under the kidney capsule of adult wild type host mice (n=5) for 5 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transplanted hearts grew and were beating at the time of harvest (Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFP+ cells originating from the transplanted hearts were observed within the host kidney as isolated cells at a rate of 5 cells/cm2 and in the host bone marrow not only as single isolated cells (46 cells/cm2) but also as colonies of  greater than 15 cells (22 colonies/cm2) (Fig 2b), suggesting these precursors originating from the transplanted embryonic hearts can home to, proliferate in the bone marrow and contribute to the circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in vitro methylcellulose based colony forming unit assays grown from bone marrow cells of the host mice developed GFP+ colonies at a rate of 1 GFP+ colony/100 colonies originating from the transplanted hearts (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to extend the findings of progenitors with hematopoietic potential within the embryonic heart, we isolated single cells from E9.5 hearts (n=6) of R26mTmG/mTmG mice (where all nucleated cells express mTomato) and injected then into the tail vein of an irradiated wild type mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four weeks later, we found mTomato+ (mT+) cells in the bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood of the host mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We characterized the immunophenotype of these cells using flow cytometry, and although these cells were rare (less_than0.01% of nucleated spleen and marrow cells), they express hematopoietic markers (Fig 2dm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our prior colony assays, mT+ cells isolated from embryonic hearts and transplanted into a recipient mouse express the cell surface markers CD11b and Ter119, markers of monocytes and erythrocytes respectively but were negative for B cell (B220) and granulocyte (Gr1) markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This transplant experiment confirms the presence of cardiac progenitors with hemogenic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, to evaluate whether in the developing heart SCLEC+ precursors possess intrinsic hemogenic properties we performed the following series of experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence for GFP, Runx1 (a master regulator of blood formation) and Hb in heart sections of EC-SCL-Cre-ERTCre/;R26mTmG/ mice (following the scheme in Fig 1a) showed at E9.5 and E10.5 cells co-expressing GFP and Runx1 or Hb in the endocardium of the outflow tract (OFT), ventricles and atria (Fig 3af).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At E12.5 (Fig 3g) we observed GFP+/Runx1+ blood islands in the ventricular septum (Fig 3h) and GFP+/Hb+ cells in ventricular endocardium (Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that within the developing embryonic heart SCLEC+ precursors give rise to hemogenic endocardium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further assess the hemogenic capacity of the early SCLEC+ precursors in the embryonic heart, we performed methylcellulose-based colony forming cell (CFC) assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We harvested cells from the hearts and different embryonic areas including major hematopoietic organs (yolk sac and caudal half at E9.5, caudal half at E10.5 and fetal liver at E12.5), at different embryonic stages from EC-SCL-Cre-ERTCre/;R26mTmG/ mice with tamoxifen treatment at E7.5 (Fig 3j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the results of cells grown from hematopoietic organs, two types of early stage hematopoietic colonies: CFU-GEMM (granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes/macrophages and megakaryocytes) and CFU-GM (granulocytes and macrophages) formed from the cells of the hearts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CFU-Mix (GEMM and GM) colonies formed at a rate of 2.3 (±1) per 1000 heart cells with 43% GFP expressing colonies at E9.5 (Fig 3k), reached a peak at E10.5 (8.4±0.6 colonies per 1000 cells, 50% GFP+) (Fig 3l) and by E12.5 decreased to 1.3 (±0.3) per 1000 cells with 8.4% GFP+ colonies (Fig 3m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results indicated that the SCLEC+ precursors give rise to early hematopoietic precursors within the early embryonic heart in a developmentally regulated manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To investigate whether SCLEC + precursors were indispensable for the normal development of the heart we designed the following ablation experiment that involves the expression of diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed R26DTA/DTA mice with EC-SCL-Cre-ERT+/ and R26mTmG/mTmG mice to generate EC-SCL-Cre-ERT+/;R26DTA/+;R26mTmG/+ (DTA+) mice, which express both DTA and GFP in the SCLEC+ precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the DTA+ embryos died within 24hrs with full dose of tamoxifen injection (1mg/30g bodyweight) at E7.5, whereas their Cre+ (EC-SCL-Cre-ERT+/;R26mTmG/+) control littermates were normal (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we injected pregnant mice with half the dose of tamoxifen (0.5mg/30g bodyweight) to partially ablate the SCLEC+ precursors, the DTA+ embryos survived to E9.5 but showed significant growth retardation (Fig 4a and b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence for GFP and cTnT on heart sections of control embryos further confirmed that part of the SCLEC+ lineage endocardium was still labeled by GFP+ expression, whereas the DTA+ embryos almost completely lost the SCLEC+ lineage endocardium labeled with GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the DTA+ embryos developed thin myocardium with impaired trabeculation (Fig 4c and d) suggesting the requirement of SCLEC+ precursors for the normal development of the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the SCLEC+ precursors contribute to the vascular system all over the embryo, the heart developmental abnormities observed in the DTA+ embryos may be influenced by concomitant systemic vascular abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether ablation of SCLEC+ precursors affects cardiac development intrinsically, we developed an ex vivo cross-transplantation model, which allows the development of the embryonic heart under the kidney capsule of the host mice and the visualization of a beating heart at the time of harvesting (Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After transplantation of hearts from E9.5 DTA+ mice and their control siblings under the kidney capsule of wild type adult host mice we induced DTA and GFP expression in SCLEC+ precursors by intraperitoneal tamoxifen injections in the host mice (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence staining for GFP and cTnT showed that the GFP+ cells were present within the heart of the control transplants (Fig 4f), with GFP+/Hb+ blood islands (Fig 4hj and Supplemental Fig 1), which further confirmed the contribution of SCLEC+ precursors to intrinsic hemo-vasculogenesis in the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the control transplanted hearts developed lumens filled by red blood cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But no GFP+ cell was found lining in the heart lumen suggesting that the expression of SCL may have occurred previous to the induction of cre by tamoxifen administration after transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the transplanted hearts from DTA+ mice did not beat and completely lost the GFP+ cells and the heart lumen structure (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments underscore the requirement of SCLEC+ precursors within the early embryonic heart for hemo-vasculogenesis and organogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Recently, we reported that timed (from E10.5) conditional deletion of S1P1 from SCL+ ECs results in abnormal heart development15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To fully characterize the role of endothelial S1P1 during early cardiac development, we treated cEC-SCL-S1P1KO mice and their control siblings with tamoxifen at E7.5 to induce GFP reporter expression and/or S1P1 deletion in the SCLEC+ lineage cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed embryonic lethality around E14.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before E13.5, the littermate controls of the cEC-SCL-S1P1KO embryos were morphologically normal, indistinguishable from non-injected ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we mainly characterized the hearts of cEC-SCL-S1P1KO mice from E12.5 to E13.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cEC-SCL-S1P1KO mice developed thin ventricular walls (22.6±1.8m, versus 44.4±2.5m in control mice pless_than0.01) and thick trabeculae (321.8±16.5m, versus 193.7±31.2m in control mice pless_than0.05) (Fig 5ah).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study whether proliferation of the myocardium was affected, we performed co-immunofluorescence staining for phosphorylated histone H3 (phh3) and the myocardial marker cardiac troponin (cTnT) on heart sections of E12.5 cEC-SCL-S1P1KO and control mice (Fig 5in).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results demonstrated a remarkable decrease in the proliferation of the myocardium in both ventricles and atria of the cEC-SCL-S1P1KO mice (Fig 5io).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was no significant difference in the trabeculae (Fig 5o).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, we found that cEC-SCL-S1P1KO embryos developed less peri-truncal CVECs within the ventricular wall than the controls (Fig 5p,q, and r, Supplemental Figure 2af), whereas their CVECs in the septum were increased (Fig 5s, Supplemental Fig 2gj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not find a difference in the number of PECAM-1+ cells within the endocardium or atria between the cEC-SCL-S1P1KO and control embryos (Fig 5s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study we identified cardiac precursors that are committed to an endothelial fate and give rise to endocardium and CVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of those precursors undergo hemo-vasculogenesis to generate ECs and blood cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic ablation of these precursors in vivo in the whole embryo or in embryonic heart transplants resulted in absence of endocardium and subsequent abnormal myocardial development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we specifically deleted S1P1 from cardiac endothelium during early heart development and revealed essential roles of endothelial S1P1 for the development of ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes and coronary vascular formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collective data from lineage analysis suggested that the endocardium, CVECs and vascular endothelium elsewhere are highly related in cellular origin and gene expression profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, fate-tracing studies of Nfatc1+ endocardium demonstrated that the endocardium is a major source of the arterial CVECs through angiogenesis3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Albeit the majority of venous CVECs and a small number of arterial CVECs were derived from the dedifferentiated sinus venous endothelium21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, another study has identified a subset of pro-epicardial precursors giving rise to a small population of CVECs and smooth muscle cells2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of the marker genes used in those studies exclusively labeled the whole population of cardiac ECs, including endocardium and CVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of specific markers for intermediate precursors committed to cardiac endothelial fate has hampered our understanding of the molecular basis of cell fate decision and cell differentiation in the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that time-labeled early SCLEC+ precursors give rise to all the endocardium and the majority of CVECs during heart development, which will enable the isolation of early cardiac EC precursors for analyzing genetic networks underling cardiac development and will ultimately be of help for the cardiac regeneration field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our studies identified in the embryonic heart intrinsic SCLEC+ precursors that differentiate not only into endothelium and endocardium but also have hemogenic capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using lineage tracing strategies, SCLEC+ precursors are found in blood islands of the developing heart, express hematopoietic markers including Runx1 and Hb, contribute to circulating blood nucleated cells and give rise to erythroid and myeloid colonies in culture indicating that they are multipotent myeloid precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CFC studies showed that fewer colonies grew from the E12.5 heart than from earlier stages, being E10.5 at its peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may due to low percentage of endothelium in the whole heart, since the cardiomyocytes and other types of cells proliferate quickly and account for a large proportion of the total heart cell mass at this age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the lower percentage of GFP expressing colonies from the E12.5 heart suggested a decreased contribution of SCLEC+ hemogenic precursors at this later stage which is in agreement with the transient hemogenic function of the embryonic heart previously described6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, cell surface marker expression studies in embryonic stem cells suggested that cardiac progenitors and hemangioblasts were two distinct populations22,23,24,25, our data suggest a contribution of cardiac hemo-vascular precursors to the hemogenic endocardium and CVECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further, in vivo experiments of embryonic heart cells transplanted into adult recipient mice, both as heart explants under the host kidney capsule and as single cells injected into the tail vein of an irradiated host, demonstrated that cells from the embryonic heart can home to the bone marrow, differentiate into myeloid and erythroid lineages and access the main circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether SCLEC+ precursors differentiate into hematopoietic stem cells and therefore also give rise to lymphoid lineages remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, to evaluate if SCLEC+ cells are the sole heart progenitors with embryonic hemogenic activity or other non-SCLEC cells within the developing heart share the same ability will require additional lineage tracing studies utilizing different cre transgenic mouse lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we described a novel cross-transplantation approach in which the embryonic heart is placed under the kidney capsule of an adult wild type mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, the developing heart continues to undergo morphogenesis, contracts rhythmically and develops its normal cardiac cavities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, selective induced ablation of SCLEC+ precursors in similarly transplanted embryonic hearts, results in the loss of SCLEC+ derived fluorescent cells, lack of cavity formation and loss of cardiac contractility indicating the crucial role of these precursors during heart development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lack of GFP+ cells lining the lumens of transplanted EC-SCL-Cre-ERT+/;R26mTmG/+ hearts may be due to late tamoxifen induction (at E9.5 after transplantation), since in our lineage studies we started to label the endocardium by injecting tamoxifen at E7.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that the environment in the transplantation affected the development of endocardium within the heart lumens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously observed that a similar cross-transplantation approach for the prevascular embryonic kidney not only allows nephrogenesis to occur but also the development of the kidney vasculature with -normal- distribution and differentiation of the cells that compose the kidney arterioles15,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further characterization of the development of the embryonic heart using this cross-transplantation model is underway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Equally important, our cEC-SCL-S1P1KO mice developed thin ventricular myocardium accompanied with abnormal trabeculation and coronary vascular development, which mimics ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy observed in human patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the cause of this disease is still elusive, it would be important to determine whether mutations of the S1P1 receptor are found in patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the S1P1 global knockout mice17, our cEC-SCL-S1P1KO mice showed reduced myocardial proliferation in the ventricles and atria, suggesting that myocardial development is regulated by endothelial S1P1 in a non-autonomous manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we found thickened trabecular tissue in the heart of cEC-SCL-S1P1KO mice, their proliferation was not significantly increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that the trabeculation is regulated by growth factors secreted by the endocardium28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, deletion of S1P1 from endocardium may affect expressions of these factors and consequently result in abnormal trabeculae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the coronary vessels in the ventricle wall and septum showed different phenotype in response to deletion of endothelial S1P1, which suggests a potentially distinct role of S1P1 during their development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that coronary vascular development is regulated by growth factors secreted by both epicardium and myocardium29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, different signaling pathways (such as VEGF, Angiopoietin and FGF) may regulate the development of CVECs in the ventricular wall and septum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether S1P1 interacts with those signaling pathways to regulate coronary vascular development needs to be studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously found that deletion of endothelial S1P1 results in increased proliferation of ECs in the kidney.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas during cardiac development S1P1 may also prevent excessive proliferation of ECs in the septum, in the coronary vessels seems to have an opposite effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, in this study we identified an indispensable common precursor labeled by SCLEC expression for all the cardiac endothelium, a subset of which possesses hemogenic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrated that endothelial S1P1 is crucial for myocardial and coronary vascular development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data and the mouse models we generated may prove useful to understand genetic defects and signaling pathways linked to congenital heart diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

For fate tracing studies, colony-forming cell assays and embryonic heart transplantations, constitutive ER-GFP-Cre20 and tamoxifen inducible EC-SCL-Cre-ERT mice13 were crossed to B6.129(Cg)-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J (R26mTmG/mTmG)30 or B6.129×1-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos/J (R26YFP/YFP)31 reporter mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pregnant mice from the tamoxifen inducible EC-SCL-Cre-ERT crosses were injected with tamoxifen intraperitoneally at a dose of 1mg/30g of body weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To genetically ablate SCLEC+ precursors, EC-SCL-Cre-ERT mice were crossed to B6.129-GT(ROSA)26SSortm1(DTA)Lky/J mice (R26DTA/DTA)32 and R26mTmG/mTmG mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial ablation of SCLEC+ precursors was achieved by injecting pregnant mice with half dose of tamoxifen (0.5mg/30g of body weight).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study the role of S1P1 in cells from the SCLEC+ lineage during heart development, cEC-SCL-S1P1KO mice were generated as previously described15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild type mice (35 months old) were used as hosts for transplantation of embryonic hearts or heart cells (the latter after irradiation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures were performed in accordance with the Guiding Principles for Research Involving Animals and Human Beings by the American Physiological Society and were approved by the University of Virginia Animal Care Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Embryonic_heart_transplantation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole embryonic hearts from E9.5 ER-GFP-Cre;R26mTmG/+ (n=10) or EC-SCL-Cre-ERT+/;R26DTA/+;R26mTmG/+ mice (DTA+, n=3) and their control siblings (EC-SCL-Cre-ERT+/;R26mTmG/+, n=3) were micro-dissected in 5% FBS medium (DMEM-Hams F-12, Cat# 11320) and transplanted under the kidney capsule of adult host mice following similar procedures previously described for embryonic kidneys15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recipient mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol intraperitoneally at a dose of 250mg/kg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ophthalmic ointment was applied to eyes to prevent drying during surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were positioned lying with their left side up on a heated operating surface at 37°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After hair removal, the animals were aseptically prepped, skin cleaned with povidone iodine and alcohol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sterile instruments were used throughout the surgical procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A left back incision was made along the dorsal lumbar side above the kidney and the muscle layers were dissected to expose the left kidney.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, a small cut was made in the kidney capsule, and a blunt 20-gauge needle was carefully inserted into the incision to create a 0.81cm subscapular tunnel towards the upper pole of kidney.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An embryonic heart was placed (using a forceps) through the tunnel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional tunnels were made towards the lower pole and middle area to transplant additional hearts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One to three fetal hearts were placed under the kidney capsule of each host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The left kidney was placed back in the abdominal cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The muscle layers and skin were sutured separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After recovering from the anesthesia on a heating pad at 37°C, and administration of the analgesic Buprenorphine 0.10.2mg/kg SC q 812hours the mice were returned to the vivarium and monitored for health and fitness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Host mice transplanted with EC-SCL-Cre-ERT+/;R26DTA/+;R26mTmG/+ and EC-SCL-Cre-ERT+/;R26mTmG/+ embryonic hearts.were injected post surgery with tamoxifen (1mg/30g of body weight) intraperitoneally for 7 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice (n=5) transplanted with ER-GFP-Cre;R26mTmG/+ hearts (n=10) were studied at 5 days after transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kidneys with the implanted hearts were removed and fixed by 24% PFA solution for immunostaining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bones and bone marrow from host mice transplanted with ER-GFP-Cre;R26mTmG/+ hearts were processed for histological analysis and colony-forming-cells assays as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_the_thickness_of_ventricular_wall_and_trabeculae  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure the thickness of the ventricular wall and trabeculae, we performed immunofluorescence for the myocardial marker cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in 5 comparable heart sections of E12.5 cEC-SCL-S1P1KO (n=5) and control (n=4) embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described previously35, the ventricular wall thickness was determined by the average length of six lines drawn between the epicardium and the edge of the myocardium compact layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 5a and d) And the thickness of trabeculae was determined by the average length of six lines drawn between the edge of ventricular wall and the tip of trabeculae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were performed by image J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_myocardium_proliferation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure the number of proliferating myocardial cells, we performed double-immunofluorescences for phosphorylated histone h3 (phh3) and cTnT in 5 comparable sections from the heart of E12.5 cEC-SCL-S1P1KO (n=5) and control (n=6) embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of phh+/cTnT+ cells were counted in each cardiac structure (ventricles, atria, septum, AVC and trabeculae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The areas of each cTnT+ cardiac structure were measured by imageJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_areas_of_endocardium_and_coronary_vascular_endothelial_cells_(CVECs)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure the area of GFP+ CVECs in the ventricles, we performed double-immunofluorescences for GFP and cTnT on 5 comparable sections from the heart of E12.5 cEC-SCL-S1P1KO (n=5) and control (n=5) embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GFP+ ventricular CVEC areas and the cTnT+ ventricular area were measured using imageJ (Supplemental Fig 2af).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The areas of GFP+ endocardium and septal CVECs were manually excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values were expressed as percentages:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure the area of PECAM-1+ endocardium in the ventricles and atria and CVEC in the septum, we performed immunofluorescence for PECAM-1 and cTnT in 5 comparable sections from the heart of E12.5 cEC-SCL-S1P1KO (n=4) and control (n=4) embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PECAM-1+ areas and cTnT+ areas were measured using imageJ (Supplemental Fig 2gj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values were expressed as percentages:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transplantation_of_embryonic_heart_cells_into_an_irradiated_host  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
E9.5 hearts (n=6) from R26mTmG/mTmGreporter mice (express fluorescent tomato in every cell) were harvested in 2% FBS in IMDM (Cat#12440053), and washed several times with 2% FBS in IMDM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation in 0.25% collagenase type I (Cat#07902, Stemcell Technologies) at 37°C cells were dissociated by gently pipette tissues up and down, every 1015min until a single cell suspension was obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells (2.93×104) were resuspended in 100l 5% FBS in IMDM and injected intravenously into an irradiated (10Gy) mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flow_Cytometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bone marrow and spleen of a transplant recipient mouse were harvested, and single cell suspensions were prepared as previously described34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the femurs and tibias were dissected using sterile technique, flushed with PBS/5% FBS, and cells were passed through a 70m strainer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spleens were dissected cleanly using sterile technique, placed on a 70m strainer and using the plunger end of a syringe, gently passed through the strainer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red blood cells were lysed using RBC lysis buffer (Biolegends, San Diego, California).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were resuspended in PBS/5% FBS, and then counted using a Cellometer Mini cell counter (Nexcelom, Lawrence, MA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One million cells of each sample were then distributed into microcentrifuge tubes and labelled with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies APC/Cy7-B220, FITC-Ter119, PE/Cy7-Gr1, and PerCP/Cy5.5-CD11b (all antibodies were purchased from Biolegends and added at predetermined optimum concentrations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunophenotyping was performed in the UVA Flow Cytometry core lab using a Fortessa cytometer, and data were analyzed using the FlowJo program (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, Oregon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
