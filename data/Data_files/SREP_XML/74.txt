USP15 regulates SMURF2 kinetics through C-lobe mediated deubiquitination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ubiquitin modification of the TGF- pathway components is emerging as a key mechanism of TGF- pathway regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To limit TGF- responses, TGF- signaling is regulated through a negative feedback loop whereby the E3 ligase SMURF2 targets the TGF- receptor (TR) complex for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counteracting this process, a number of deubiquitinating (DUBs) enzymes have recently been identified that deubiquitinate and stabilize the TR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However the precise mechanism by which these DUBs act on TR function remains poorly defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that apart from targeting the TR complex directly, USP15 also deubiquitinates SMURF2 resulting in enhanced TR stability and downstream pathway activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through proteomic analysis, we show that USP15 modulates the ubiquitination of Lys734, a residue required for SMURF2 catalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that SMURF2 is a critical target of USP15 in the TGF- pathway and may also explain how USP15 and SMURF2 target multiple complementary protein complexes in other pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein modification by ubiquitination is one of the key posttranslational modifications that regulate protein function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ubiquitylation of substrates occurs through a ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation cascade involving the ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), and the ubiquitin ligase enzyme (E3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E3s primary function is to facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin to the target substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E3 ubiquitin ligases are primarily classified on the basis of their functional (catalytic) domain; the two major types are Really Interesting New Gene (RING) and the Homologues to E6-AP C Terminus (HECT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of RING E3 ligases, the E3 acts as a scaffold bringing into proximity the substrate and the E1-activated E2-ubiquitin intermediate, permitting transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 directly to the substrate1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, with HECT E3 ligases, ubiquitin charged E2 transfers ubiquitin directly to the active site cysteine in its HECT domain via a transthiolation reaction2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Target lysine residues of the substrate subsequently attack the thioester bond which results in ubiquitin being transferred from the E3 to the substrate2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The TGF- family members, which include TGF-s, Nodal and Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) are secreted cytokines that regulate a vast array of biological activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TGF- ligand activation of the pathway is transmitted through the heterotrimeric complexes of type II (TRII) and type I (TRI) transmembrane Ser/Thr kinases receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activated receptors initiate an intracellular signaling through phosphorylation of specific receptor regulated (R)-SMADs (SMAD2/SMAD3) in their C-terminal SXS motif3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphorylation of R-SMADs in their terminus creates an interaction interface that permits them to oligomerize with the co-SMAD, SMAD44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once formed, the SMAD complex translocates to the nucleus where they interact with various DNA binding proteins to regulate gene expression in a cell type and context specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Control of the desired TGF- responses is tightly regulated through a number of different inhibitory mechanisms including ubiquitination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As part of a negative feedback loop, the inhibitor adaptor protein SMAD7, itself a direct transcriptional target of the SMAD complexes, acts as scaffold to recruit SMURF2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the C2-WW-HECT domain class, and the E2 ligase UBCH7 to the TGF- receptor complex to facilitate receptor degradation and attenuate TGF- signaling5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of SMAD7 to SMURF2 also serves another purpose, SMURF2 has the ability to undergo autoubiquitination and therefore to maintain its stability and constrain unwanted activity towards its substrates, the C2 and HECT domains remain in a tightly closed conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of SMAD7 to the HECT domain of SMURF2 abrogates the inhibitory intramolecular interactions between these domains, facilitating SMURF2 ubiquitin ligase activity7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the binding of SMAD7 to the activated receptor complex prevents access of R-SMADs to the receptor complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ubiquitination is a reversible process, and ubiquitin moieties can be removed from polypeptides by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a number of DUBs have been identified that oppose the ubiquitination and degradation of the TGF- receptor complex8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore to better understand the cross functionality of these DUBs we sought to delineate the mechanism of how these DUBs affect TR stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a functional genetic screen we have previously found that USP15 forms a complex with SMAD7 and SMURF2 and is recruited to the TGF- receptor complex, where it deubiquitinates and stabilizes TRI9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario SMAD7 acts as an adaptor protein, interacting with two enzymes with opposing activities resulting in a constant balancing act between the ligase and DUB in regulating TGF- output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, Peter ten Dijke and colleagues have demonstrated that TRAF4 facilitates the recruitment of USP15 to the TR complex antagonizing SMURF2 mediated degradation of the complex12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now establish that USP15 also directly deubiquitinates the E3 ligase SMURF2, opposing the activity of SMURF2 towards the TR complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemically we demonstrate that USP15 regulates ubiquitination of a number of lysine residues on SMURF2 including a key residue in the C-Lobe of SMURF2 which has previously been suggested to be required for ubiquitin transfer from the E2 to the catalytic cysteine in SMURF213.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

USP15_mediated_activation_of_the_TGF-_pathway_is_inhibited_by_a_catalytically_inactive_mutant_of_SMURF2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The DUBs USP4, USP11, USP15, and UCH37 have previously been demonstrated to modulate TGF- pathway activity by directly deubiquitinating the TRI, resulting in increased TRI stability (Fig 1A,B)8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As DUBs USP11, USP15, and UCH37 all form a complex with SMAD7, we first assessed if DUB function is dependent on the ubiquitination of TR-I by SMURF2, the E3 ligase, which binds to SMAD7 and targets the TR complex for degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We co-transfected HEK293T cells with the TGF--responsive luciferase reporter (CAGA-Luc) and each of the individual DUBs with a catalytically inactive mutant of SMURF2 (Cys716Ala, C/A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous reports, overexpression of USP4, 11, and 15 significantly enhanced the activity of the reporter (Fig 1C; Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1A, B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, UCH37 demonstrated a minimal increase in CAGA-Luc activity suggesting that UCH37 may also target the TGF- pathway downstream of the TR complex to regulate overall TGF- signaling (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, co-expression of catalytically inactive SMURF2 completely abolished the ability of USP15 to activate this reporter (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, USP4 activity was unaffected by the co-expression of SMURF2 C/A while USP11 activity was only partially inhibited (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1A, B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, USP15 regulation of the TGF- pathway is in part dependent upon the function of SMURF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore decided to focus our attention on USP15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the role of USP15 in the TGF- pathway we generated null alleles for USP15 in 293T cells using the type II CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guide RNA was cloned into the PX330 vector which permits both expression of guide RNA and Cas9 on a single expression plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  293T cells were transfected and a single independent clone was isolated that carried frameshift mutations on both alleles resulting in a USP15 null expression cell line, USP15CRSP1 (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2A, B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  USP15CRSP1 cells exhibited a significant decrease in TR-I stability resulting in overall downregulation of the TGF- pathway as determined by a decrease in activity of the TGF- responsive reporter, CAGA-Luc (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2C, D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of TRI stability in USP15 targeted CRISPR cell lines was reverted by complementation with ectopically expressed USP15, indicating that the observed phenotype is due to loss of USP15 expression and not through unwanted off target effects (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we analysed whether degradation of TRI in USP15 null cells was attenuated in the presence of catalytically inactive SMURF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the inhibitory effect of USP15 knockout was diminished upon co-expression of SMURF2 C/A (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further examine if USP15 activity in the TGF- pathway is dependent upon SMURF2 function we generated CRISPR/CAS knockout cells for SMURF2 (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A, B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, SMURF2CRSP1 cells displayed enhanced TRI stability and overall activation of the TGF- pathway, which was dependent on SMURF2 as reintroduction of SMURF2 inhibited these effects (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3C, D, E, F, G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, co-expression of USP15 annulled the inhibitory actions of SMURF2 on the TGF- pathway (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3F, G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ectopic expression of USP15 did not augment TRI levels or overall TGF- luciferase activity in SMURF2CRSP1 cell lines when expressed alone or in combination with SMURF2 C/A indicating that USP15s role in the TGF- pathway is dependent on SMURF2 function (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3F, G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar effects were observed when we ectopically expressed SMURF2 C/A (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been described that a catalytically inactive version of SMURF2 can act as a dominant negative through sequestration of TRI, preventing endogenous SMURF2 interaction, resulting in overall TR stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we do not observe this effect in luciferase reporter assays indicating that in this context, the effect of SMURF2 C/A on endogenous SMURF2 is negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then assessed the relationship of these proteins on the downstream activation of R-SMADs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with previous results, TGF- induced phosphorylated SMAD2 (p-SMAD2) was decreased upon suppression of endogenous USP15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the inhibitory effect of USP15 knockdown was again attenuated upon co-expression of SMURF2 C/A (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, ectopic expression of USP15 and SMURF2 C/A did not enhance p-SMAD2 levels compared with either construct alone (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that USP15 may function through SMURF2 to regulate TRI stability and downstream TGF- signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

USP15_regulates_the_ubiquitination_of_the_E3_ligase_SMURF2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In light of the data presented so far we reasoned that USP15 may also directly deubiquitinate SMURF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reveal ubiquitinated isoforms of SMURF2 we co-transfected HEK293T cells with expression plasmids encoding SMURF2, HA-tagged ubiquitin, and either USP15, USP4, USP11, or UCH37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, all three DUBs that form a complex with SMAD7 and therefore potentially SMURF2 affected the ubiquitination levels of SMURF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both USP15 and UCH37 deubiquitinated SMURF2 to varying degrees, however, the effect of USP15 on SMURF2 was consistently more robust (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  USP11 enhanced SMURF2 ubiquitination, indicating that the effect of USP11 on SMURF2 function is indirect (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of USP4 did not alter the ubiquitination status of SMURF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, wild-type USP15, but not a catalytically inactive version of USP15, USP15 C269S (USP15 C/S), caused a marked reduction in SMURF2 ubiquitination (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were observed when we analyzed endogenous ubiquitination levels of SMURF2 in the presence of USP15 or USP15 C/S (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To see if USP15 deubiquitinated SMURF2 in vitro, we purified USP15 and Ub-SMURF2 from extracts of HEK293T cells and proteins were mixed under conditions supporting SMURF2 deubiquitination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in supplementary Fig 4A, USP15 but not USP15 C/S reduced the levels of Ub-SMURF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in vitro deubiquitination of SMURF2 was unique to USP15 since the co-administration of other DUBs to Ub-SMURF2 did not significantly decrease overall SMURF2 ubiquitination levels (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with these results, suppression of USP15 significantly increased the incorporation of ubiquitin into SMURF2 in both the endogenous setting and in cell lines ectopically expressing HA-Ub (Fig 2D, Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if USP15 null cells enhanced the ubiquitination of SMURF2, we co-transfected plasmids expressing SMURF2 and HA-tagged ubiquitin into 293T cells or their USP15 null counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  USP15 knockout cells exhibited a robust increase in the ubiquitination levels of SMURF2 compared to wild type 293T cells (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that USP15 regulates SMURF2 ubiquitination in vivo and in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is important to note that ectopic expression of USP15 did not dramatically alter steady state levels of SMURF2 suggesting that USP15 regulates SMURF2 function through other mechanisms independent of proteasome degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_ubiquitinated_lysine_residues_on_SMURF2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ubiquitination of substrates occurs primarily through the binding of the Gly76 of Ub to a Lys (K) residue on the substrate resulting in the formation of an isopeptide bond between the carboxylic acid group of Gly76 and the epsilon amino group of the target lysine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent data has demonstrated that non-covalent ubiquitin binding to the HECT domain of E3 ligases may play a role in regulating polyubiquitination14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, most DUBs, including the USP family of DUBs, specifically target isopeptide bond formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore to identify potential Ub residues targeted by USP15 on SMURF2 we performed mass spectrometry specifically mapping ubiquitinated lysines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were prepared by transfecting HEK293T cells with Flag-tagged SMURF2 and HA-tagged Ub with or without USP15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMURF2 was subsequently immunoprecipitated with FLAG resin beads and protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mono-ubiquitinated and multi-mono-ubiquitinated isoforms of SMURF2 were isolated, digested with trypsin and prepared for analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 12 novel ubiquitination sites with a greater than 80% coverage of lysine residues in SMURF2 (Fig 3B,C, Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5 and data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross-analyses of ubiquitination predictor programs identified a number of complementary putative ubiquitination sites including K38, K345, K375, K377, K687, and K734 (http://www.ubpred.org, http://protein.cau.edu.cn/cksaap_ubsite/, and http://bdmpub.biocuckoo.org/results.php).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, several of the ubiquitinated residues appear to be regulated by USP15 as overexpression of USP15 decreased the levels of a number of ubiquitinated peptides including, K615, K620, and K687 (Fig 3B,C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, low confidence spectra data of ubiquitinated peptides K412 and K734 were the result of a miscleavage event (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both loci contain multiple Arg and Lys residues (susceptible to tryptic digestion) rendering the resulting digested peptides too small to be detected by standard MASS SPEC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that SMURF2 forms covalent isopeptide bonds with ubiquitin at multiple residues along its external surface, a subset of which can be targeted for deubiquitination by USP15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further understand the functional significance of the potential Ub sites we prepared a series of SMURF2 mutants harboring lysine to arginine substitutions and tested SMURF2 activity by its ability to inhibit TGF- induced CAGA-luciferase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although most SMURF2 mutants behaved similar to the wild type counterpart we found that mutations at Lys38 (K38R) and Lys734 (K734R) significantly decreased SMURF2 activity (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both USP15 and SMURF2 target multiple components of the TGF- pathway therefore we sought to provide experimental evidence that the candidate USP15 deubiquitination sites on SMURF2 had the ability to rescue TRI stability9,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with TRI and SMURF2 or its corresponding mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that only mutations at Lys734 caused a pronounced attenuation of SMURF2 mediated degradation of TGF- receptor levels (Fig 4B, Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our results and those of others indicate that SMURF2 may undergo various ubiquitination events (mono, multi-mono, or polyubiquitination), we reasoned that ubiquitination at multiple residues may have a cumulative effect on SMURF2 activity7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We took into focus the candidate USP15 deubiquitination sites on the HECT domain of SMURF2 (K615, K620, K687) that reside in close proximity to Lys734.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the combined mutation of Lys687 and Lys734 partially enhanced the rescue of TGF- activity compared to Lys734 mutant alone (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mutation of Lys615 and Lys620 did not further enhance this effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Lys734 was absolutely crucial to this effect as a SMURF2 variant mutated only at Lys615, Lys620, and Lys687 completely inhibited luciferase activity in line with wild-type SMURF2 (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we assessed the impact of Lys734 mutation on TRI stability over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We followed the degradation pattern of TRI in HEK293T cells transfected with either wild type SMURF2 or SMURF2 K734R and exposed to TGF- and cyclohexamide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ectopic expression of SMURF2 increased receptor degradation over time with respect to control cells (Fig 4D, Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in SMURF2 K734R expressing cells, TRI degradation was dramatically reduced (Fig 4D, Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ectopic expression of SMURF2 K734R completely attenuated SMURF2 inhibition of phosphorylated SMAD2 following the addition of TGF- (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together our results indicate that Lys734 is a critical residue on SMURF2 that is required for effective targeting of the TRI for degradation and overall downregulation of TGF- activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lysine_734_of_SMURF2_is_critical_for_the_function_of_USP15_in_the_TGF-_pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Autoubiquitination of SMURF2 family members (SMURF1/2-NEDD4-Rsp5P) have been determined to be a critical factor in their ability to ubiquitinate their respective substrates18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that USP15 directly deubiquitinates SMURF2 potentially resulting in the inhibition of SMURF2 catalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Lys734 appears to be a critical residue for SMURF2 activity in the TGF- pathway we sought to investigate if USP15 regulates Lys734 ubiquitination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To specifically reveal Lys734 ubiquitinated isoforms of SMURF2 we generated a SMURF2 variant mutated at all ubiquitination sites identified by MASS SPEC, which are potentially regulated by USP15, SMURF2 (K0), and a SMURF2 mutant wild type only at Lys734 (K0-K734).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, when we analyzed the ubiquitination pattern of these SMURF2 mutants in lysates of transfected HEK293T cells in the presence of USP15 knockdown vectors, we found that, in addition to wild type SMURF2, loss of USP15 only enhanced SMURF2 ubiquitination in the SMURF2 (K0734) variant, but not in SMURF2 (K0) lysine less mutant (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that Lys734 of SMURF2 is not only ubiquitinated but also a target site for USP15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since USP15 can potentially regulate SMURF2 ubiquitination at Lys734 we examined whether USP15 is able to regulate TRI stability in the presence of a SMURF2 K734 mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end we co-transfected HEK293T cells with SMURF2 K734 in the presence or absence of knockdown vectors targeting USP15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with previous results, Lys734 partially attenuated SMURF2 mediated degradation of TRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, whereas TRI stability was sensitive to USP15 knockdown, cells co-transfected with SMURF2 K734 were completely insensitive to USP15 depletion (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, luciferase assay results demonstrate that overall TGF- activity in the presence of over-expressed SMURF2 K734 remains relatively unchanged regardless of the expression levels of USP15 (Fig 5C,D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that ubiquitination at Lys734 of SMURF2 is a required determinant for USP15 function in the TGF- pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SMURF2_requires_lysine_734_for_transthiolation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we investigated how mutating Lys734 would alter the molecular function of SMURF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Work in recent years has demonstrated that SMAD7 acts as a key regulator of many HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligases in the TGF- pathway primarily by optimizing the interaction surfaces of these proteins6,7,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of SMAD7 to SMURF2 functions to limit the intramolecular interactions between the C2 and HECT domains of SMURF2, essentially opening up the protein and permitting the recruitment of the E2 ligase to the HECT domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, we tested if mutated SMURF2 could form complexes with both SMAD7 and USP15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 6A,B, mutated SMURF2 bound to both USP15 and SMAD7 to the same degree as wild type SMURF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also investigated whether Lys734 played a role in modulating the intramolecular interactions between the C2 and HECT domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To that end, we introduced a Lys734 mutation into an activated form of SMURF2 mutated at two residues (F29A/F30A), which are required to form the interaction interface between the C2 and HECT domains7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions we speculated that if Lys734 is involved in abrogating the intramolecular interactions between the C2 and HECT domains, mutation of Lys734 would be incapable of inhibiting SMURF2 activity in the presence of F29A/F30A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, mutation at Lys734 completely inhibited the active form of the SMURF2 (F29A/F30A) mutant to a greater degree then Lys734 mutation alone (Fig 6C,D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the role of ubiquitination at Lys734 on SMURF2 activity is independent of the autoinhibitory effect the C2 domain plays on HECT function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the C-lobe portion of the HECT domain has previously been implicated in anchoring the Ub from the E2 prior to thioester bond formation, it may suggest that Lys734 is required to prime SMURF2 for catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To directly test this we performed a transthiolation assay on NEDD4, a SMURF2 family member containing the same conserved lysine residue within its C-Lobe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 6E mutation of Lys885 completely impaired the ability of the protein to receive Ub from the E2 resulting in the inability of Ub to form a thioester bond with NEDD4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results show that Lys734 may be a critical site for the enzymatic steps leading to the catalytic ubiquitination of SMURF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lys734_is_required_for_SMURF2_inhibition_of_TGF-_biological_effects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Depending on cellular context TGF- can either elicit a potent cytostatic response or promote tumorigenesis through a number of biological responses, including cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As SMURF2 is a potent inhibitor of TGF- activity we investigated whether introducing a K734R mutant of SMURF2 into the TGF- responsive metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 compromises the ability of SMURF2 to reduce TGF- dependent migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with either control vector, SMURF2 (wild-type) or SMURF2 (K734R) via lentiviral transduction (Fig 7C) and migration was quantified by scratch assays and by transwell migration assays (Fig 7A,B,D,E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with previous results, SMURF2 K734R partially abolished SMURF2 mediated inhibition of TGF- induced migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together these results show that Lys734 is crucial for SMURF2 function in regulating TGF- biological effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SMURF2 E3 ligase regulates the fate of numerous proteins involved in cellular signaling therefore precise regulation of its activity is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMURF2 activity is stimulated by the binding of SMAD7, which abrogates the intramolecular interactions between the C2 and HECT domains permitting SMURF2 autoubiquitination and activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMAD7 also recruits SMURF2 to the TGF- receptor complex to facilitate its ubiquitination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to proteasome mediated degradation of the SMAD7/SMURF2/TR complex and attenuation of TGF- signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counteracting this process, a number of DUBs have been identified which deubiquitinate the TGF- receptor resulting in its stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanistic details, however, of these events remain ambiguous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here our results suggest that the deubiquitinating enzyme USP15 intricately controls SMURF2 ligase activity by regulating C-Lobe ubiquitination resulting in the loss of SMURF2 catalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that USP15 simultaneously targets both the E3 ligase and its respective substrate, TGF- receptor, is unsurprising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar fashion the ubiquitin specific protease HAUSP also targets both the E3 ligase, MDM2, and its substrate p5320,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, recent reports have identified a number of shared substrates of SMURF2 and USP15 including MDM2, SMAD3, and RNF20, suggesting that the association between SMURF2 and USP15 may serve as a common regulatory method to control multiple analogous cellular protein complexes16,22,23,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the ubiquitination transfer cascade, the C-Lobe of the HECT domain forms multiple non-covalent interactions with the E2 bound Ub, anchoring Ub in close proximity to the catalytic cysteine (C716) thereby allowing a thioester bond to form between the catalytic cysteine of SMURF2 and the incoming Ub13,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these interacting residues in the C-lobe appears to be Lys940 of NEDD4L, which forms a hydrogen bond between the backbone oxygen of Gly35 of Ub13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence analyses confirmed that NEDD4L Lys940 is a conserved residue in all of the NEDD4 family members including, NEDD4 (Lys885) and SMURF2 (Lys734) (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports have demonstrated that mutations affecting the interaction between the HECT domain and the incoming Ub disrupt the transfer of Ub from the E2 to the E3 and thioester bond formation13,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, our data clearly indicates that residue Lys885 of NEDD4 is also absolutely required for the formation of the thioester bond at the catalytic cysteine (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following transthiolation the interaction between Lys885 and the catalytically bound Ub is not observed, potentially freeing up Lys885 for post-translational modifications27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our data suggests that the corresponding residue on SMURF2 Lys734 may be ubiquitinated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, isopeptide bond formation due to a resulting bound ubiquitin at Lys734 prior to E2 Ub transfer would impair potential hydrogen bond formation and limit Ub transfer from E2 to SMURF2, in essence creating a partial dominant negative version of SMURF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we hypothesize a two-step process whereby ubiquitination at Lys734 occurs following Ub transfer from the E2 to the E3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better understand the essential dynamics underlying C-Lobe mediated ubiquitination we modeled the three dimensional structure of Ub-loaded SMURF2 structure and probed the associated dynamics by subjecting it to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basic analysis of these simulations are described in supplementary figures S8A, S8B, S8C, and S8D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations reveal that upon thioester bond formation Lys734 no longer forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytically bound Ub potentially permitting Lys734 to form an isopeptide bond with a secondary Ub (Fig 8A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we also tested the effect of Ub bound to Lys734 on the donor ubiquitin (Ub1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulation showed that the bound state conformation of Ub1 with respect to the C-lobe domain of SMURF2 is influenced by Ub2 (Fig 8C,D, Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 9A, Supplementary Movies S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the inter-helical angle between the pair of helices H1 and H2 present in Ub1 and C-lobe domain of SMURF2 respectively indicate a significant alteration in the angle in SMURF2:Ub1:Ub2 system (Sup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S9A and S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measurement is a clear indication of the change in the orientation of Ub1 relative to the C-lobe domain in the presence of Ub2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further characterize the effect of this change on Ub1, we have investigated the interactions between Ub1 and SMURF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As indicated in Table S1 interactions between Ub1 and SMURF2 are a combination of both van der Waals and hydrogen-bond interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clear from the data, that despite some common set of residue-pairs that are in contact in both the simulations, we observe a distinct difference in the interactions that are formed between SMURF2:Ub1:Ub2 and SMURF2:Ub1 systems (Fig 8B,D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicate that the conformational reorientation of Ub1 in the presence of Ub2 does indeed cause a change in its interaction profile with SMURF2 and hint that ubiquitination at Lys734 may be an important factor for the efficient transfer of Ub from the E3 to its substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following Ub ligation, USP15 may subsequently function to regulate Lys734 ubiquitination permitting the HECT domain to receive another Ub from the E2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reports have indicated that the C-Lobe forms non-covalent interactions with donor Ub to determine ubiquitin chain specificity suggesting the possibility that Lys734 may also play a role in donor Ub availability13,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional investigation will be required to fully understand how post-translational modifications of C-Lobe affects non-covalently bound Ub and the formation of polyubiquitin chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An outstanding question remains as to the identity of the ligase that targets Lys734 for ubiquitination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems unlikely that Lys734 ubiquitination is a result of SMURF2 autoubiquitination as this would counteract any further E2-E3 Ub transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRAF4 has recently been shown to ubiquitinate SMURF2, but TRAF4 also seems like an unlikely candidate since TRAF4 ubiquitination targets SMURF2 for proteosomal degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further experimentation will be required to elucidate the mechanism behind Lys734 ubiquitination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the more interesting findings of our study is the difference in SMURF2 activity when Lys734 is mutated in wild type SMURF2 compared to when it is mutated in the SMURF2 (F29A/F30A) variant (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several potential implications of these observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such implication is that upon the binding of SMAD7 and the loss of the intramolecular interactions between the N-Lobe and C-Lobe, overall SMURF2 activity in the TGF- pathway is absolutely dependent upon Lys734 integrity for appropriate E2 to E3 ubiquitin transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mutation of Lys734 in wild type SMURF2 only partially inhibited SMURF2 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Figs 4A,C,5A and 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As our data indicates, Lys734 is critical for transthiolation and activation of SMURF2, thus suggesting that SMURF2 may play an inhibitory function in TGF- signaling independent of substrate ubiquitination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, transfer of Ub in Lys734 mutants from the E2 to E3 may still be occurring albeit at a lower kinetic rate undetectable in our experiments, permitting low levels of SMURF2 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings accentuate the complexity of the HECT ligase ubiquitination cascade but they also reveal a weakness that may be exploited in order to effectively target these enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMURF2 is frequently amplified in a number of solid tumors however, effective targeting of HECT domain ligases remains elusive (cBioPortal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent data has demonstrated that inhibition of SMURF2 by genetic means enhances MEK inhibitor sensitivity in melanoma29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One implication of our work may be that specific targeting of the C-Lobe of SMURF2 may potentially be utilized as a successful strategy to down regulate SMURF2 activity in a context dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
