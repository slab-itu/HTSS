2-Aminobutyric acid modulates glutathione homeostasis in the myocardium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A previous report showed that the consumption of glutathione through oxidative stress activates the glutathione synthetic pathway, which is accompanied by production of ophthalmic acid from 2-aminobutyric acid (2-AB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted a comprehensive quantification of serum metabolites using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in patients with atrial septal defect to find clues for understanding myocardial metabolic regulation, and demonstrated that circulating 2-AB levels reflect hemodynamic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the metabolism and pathophysiological role of 2-AB remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We revealed that 2-AB is generated by an amino group transfer reaction to 2-oxobutyric acid, a byproduct of cysteine biosynthesis from cystathionine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because cysteine is a rate-limiting substrate for glutathione synthesis, we hypothesized that 2-AB reflects glutathione compensation against oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A murine cardiomyopathy model induced by doxorubicin supported our hypothesis, i.e., increased reactive oxygen species are accompanied by 2-AB accumulation and compensatory maintenance of myocardial glutathione levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, we also found that 2-AB increases intracellular glutathione levels by activating AMPK and exerts protective effects against oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrated that oral administration of 2-AB efficiently raises both circulating and myocardial glutathione levels and protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the first study to demonstrate that 2-AB modulates glutathione homeostasis in the myocardium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Heart failure is becoming a worldwide public health problem and still has no known cure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the escalating medical care costs for heart failure impose a significant economic burden on our society1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of novel strategies to detect and treat patients at an early stage of heart failure before irreversible damage has occurred is an urgent task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We comprehensively quantified water-soluble metabolites in the blood of atrial septal defect (ASD) patients using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to find clues for understanding myocardial metabolic regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolomics provides a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics and the interaction of low-molecular weight metabolites under specific conditions3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, circulating metabolites can be influenced by various factors, including other conditions of interest, medical agents, and diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To alleviate these limitations, we focused on serum metabolic profiling in patients with ASD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASD is characterized by shunting across a defect in the interatrial septum, and a comparison before and after ASD closure in the same person allows to evaluate the impact of hemodynamic changes on circulating metabolic profiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, since patients in the absence of significant volume overload or arrhythmia generally do not require specific medical therapy, metabolic profiling in patients with ASD also has an advantage for reducing the influence of medications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we found that circulating 2-aminobutyric acid (2-AB) levels alter depending on hemodynamic status in patients with ASD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reduced glutathione (GSH), which is a ubiquitous tripeptide thiol, plays an essential role in the maintenance of the intracellular redox state6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dysregulation of GSH homeostasis is implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiac remodeling and dysfunction7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSH is synthesized through consecutive reactions with -glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidative stress activates the GSH biosynthetic pathway to compensate for increased GSH consumption6,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, Soga et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  reported that the activation of GSH biosynthetic pathway simultaneously initiates the production of ophthalmic acid, a GSH analog, from 2-aminobutyric acid (2-AB) and that ophthalmic acid is a potential biomarker for hepatic GSH depletion following oxidative stress12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the regulatory mechanism of 2-AB metabolism under oxidative stress remains unidentified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we sought to investigate the pathophysiological role of 2-AB focusing on GSH homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Circulating_2-AB_levels_alter_depending_on_hemodynamic_status  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metabolome analysis in patients with ASD revealed that circulating 2-AB was significantly decreased 1 month after transcatheter closure of ASD among 85 metabolites (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the mean level of 2-AB in ASD patients was increased compared with that in healthy volunteers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One month after closure of ASD, serum 2-AB levels in patients decreased to almost the same levels as in healthy volunteers (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we examined the relationship between the levels of 2-AB and clinical data (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, 2-AB concentrations were significantly correlated with tricuspid regurgitation peak gradient (TRPG) assessed by echocardiography, which is equal to a peak systolic pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the right atrium (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because TRPG elevation reflects right-sided heart overload as a sequela of left-to-right shunting across the ASD, we examined whether mechanical stress to cardiomyocytes induces intracellular 2-AB accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentiated H9c2 cardiomyocytes were plated on a collagen-coated chamber, and the cells were stretched by 10% for 1h (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanical stress increased the 2-AB levels in H9c2 cells and the culture medium (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

2-AB_is_an_amino_transfer_enzyme-mediated_byproduct_in_the_cysteine_biosynthesis_pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we sought to identify the 2-AB synthesis pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that 2-AB has a similar structural formula to cysteine (Fig 2a), we hypothesized that 2-AB is produced using the cysteine biosynthesis pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When cysteine is biosynthesized from cystathionine, 2-oxobutyric acid (2-OBA) is generated simultaneously (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the structure of 2-AB, we hypothesized that 2-AB is generated by an amino group transfer reaction to 2-OBA by amino transfer enzymes, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, 2-OBA was incubated with glutamic acid and AST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 2-AB was produced in accordance with increasing 2-OBA concentration (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then investigated whether 2-AB was generated from 2-OBA in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because 2-OBA was not incorporated into the cells, we prepared ethyl 2-OBA to promote the incorporation into cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that 2-AB was biosynthesized from the incorporated 2-OBA (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the involvement of amino transfer enzymes for 2-AB biosynthesis, we used an inhibitor of AST, aminooxyacetic acid (AOA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although AOA treatment had no effect on the incorporation of 2-OBA, 2-AB production was significantly suppressed (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that 2-AB is an AST-mediated byproduct in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

GSH_compensation_against_oxidative_stress_accompanies_elevation_of_2-AB  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because cysteine is a rate-limiting substrate for de novo GSH synthesis13, we hypothesized that 2-AB reflects a compensatory maintenance of GSH under oxidative stress conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that oxidative stress caused by H2O2 administration increased the 2-AB levels in both cardiomyocytes and culture medium (Fig 3a,b), depending on AST activity (Supplementary Figure 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidative stress also increased the total GSH levels, which suggests that GSH production is increased to counteract oxidative stress (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanical stress-induced 2-AB accumulation may also be mediated by oxidative stress, because stretch stress has been reported to increase ROS levels in cardiomyocytes14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also assessed whether 2-AB reflects the myocardial redox state in murine models of cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (DOX), which causes cardiac damage via oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Echocardiographic analysis of cardiac function revealed that the administration of DOX decreased the percentage of fractional shortening (%FS) (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of 2-AB in both plasma and hearts were also increased after the administration of DOX (Fig 3e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the 2-AB levels in plasma were associated with %FS (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) abundance was increased in DOX-treated hearts, consistent with previous reports (Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the total GSH levels were retained (Fig 3i), which suggests that increased 2-AB reflected a compensation in GSH levels for consumption by ROS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports suggested that the detection of GSH deficiency in blood could be a novel strategy for the early diagnosis of heart failure15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because the extracellular GSH levels are 100- to 1000-fold lower than the intracellular levels16, we could not determine the circulating GSH levels using a popular enzymatic recycling assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, as shown in the present study, the GSH levels do not necessarily decrease in parallel with ROS production because of its compensatory mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the present findings suggest that the monitoring of circulating 2-AB levels has a potential to provide a better understanding of GSH homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Next, we investigated the physiological roles of 2-AB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When 2-AB was treated with H9c2 cells, 2-AB was easily incorporated into cells, the most probable mechanism being via amino acid transporters (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, intracellular GSH levels were increased after incubation with 2-AB (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine how 2-AB influences GSH levels in cells, we metabolically profiled 2-AB treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolic profiles of cardiomyocytes stimulated by 2-AB imply the activation of the serine biosynthesis pathway (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A decrease in serine indicates the satisfaction of glycine requirements, which is mainly biosynthesized from serine and components of GSH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, serine is required for the reaction that produces cystathionine from homocysteine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glutamine, a precursor of glutamic acid, was also decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot conclude without metabolic flux analysis, these results might reflect that 2-AB alters metabolism to meet the demands of the intermediates for GSH synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent studies have revealed that AMPK has a key function in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) maintenance17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxidized form of GSH (GSSG) is reduced with NADPH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesized that 2-AB regulates AMPK activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this notion, AMPK was activated in H9c2 cells treated with 2-AB (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As further confirmation of the involvement AMPK on GSH production induced by 2-AB, we inhibited AMPK using an AMPK inhibitor and assessed GSH productivity of 2-AB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the treatment of AMPK inhibitor decreased GSH production (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that AMPK allosterically activated by AMP18, we measured the levels of AMP in 2-AB treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treatment of 2-AB increased the intracellular levels of AMP (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data support the idea that 2-AB regulates AMPK activity to increase the GSH levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether 2-AB mediated elevation of GSH possesses cell protective effects, we examined the roles of 2-AB in cell viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment with 2-AB suppressed the cell death observed when H9c2 cardiomyocytes were incubated with H2O2 (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm 2-AB mediated GSH production in vivo, 2-AB was administered to mice in drinking water for 1 week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oral administration of 2-AB had no effect on body weight (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amounts of 2-AB were increased in both plasma and hearts in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coincident with 2-AB increase, GSH levels in plasma and hearts increased (Fig 5d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we also sought to demonstrate the cardioprotective effect of 2-AB in vivo (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment with 2-AB protected against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy in mice concomitantly with elevation of myocardial GSH levels (Fig 5g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, the elevation of 2-AB levels in heart tissue has also been observed in global metabolomics analysis of a hamster model for dilated cardiomyopathy19, supporting the notion that 2-AB could facilitate early detection of heart failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exogenous GSH preserves mitochondrial energetic/redox balance and exerts cardioprotective effects20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, oral administration of GSH does not efficiently increase circulating levels of GSH24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas 2-OBA requires esterification for cellular uptake, 2-AB is incorporated directly into cells, followed by an increase in intracellular GSH levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, oral intake of 2-AB raised both circulating and myocardial GSH levels and provided a cardioprotective effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the current findings suggest the potential of 2-AB modulation as a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting dysregulation in cellular GSH homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
